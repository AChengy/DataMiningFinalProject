Spelling Bee in Chinese, to be exact.||14
Serious question: can you have a spelling bee in a language that has a logographic writing system? Does the concept of "spelling [outloud]" even exist in Mandarin?|Supersonics|4
i guess the other replies said it better than i could. the only thing i have to add is that there\'s a lot of homophones. like you can have the same sound and same tone, but write it several different ways and each different way has a different meaning. and you differentiate by combining it with other words. like in English if I said traintracks vs training, the train part sounds the same but when i tack on different sounds, the "train" takes on a different meaning. When writing single characters, you can just provide that context. Like, "My name is Train Chen. Train as in training." and then they would be like, "oh. so he has the character for the word train like training for something instead of the train that you ride." This is assuming that they\'re already literate ofc, which I am not at all lol.||2
There are spelling bee style TV shows in China, but instead of vocalising the words the kids instead write out the characters in a digital display that is shown on a large screen for the viewers/audience.\n\nYou could technically vocalise each stroke as there is a formal order for how each character should be properly written but I think it was just more practical to have them write it out.|Grizzlies|4
That\'s super interesting. Difficult to compare, I suppose, but I wonder if this sort of competition is in any way "easier" for the contestants because of the visual reinforcement one gets from writing something out (the same way I might have to write a word like "embarrassment" or "Alanis Morissette" down to make sure I have all the double letters properly distributed).|Supersonics|2

This is the exact game we needed from LeBron, and was a textbook LeBron takeover.

His athleticism is declining and so is he. The fact that he's still this athletic and is still so good just shows how insane he was before\n|Lakers|158
If you're 10/10 and everyone else is 8/10, declining down to 8.5/10 still makes you inhuman. Trust me, I'm a math scientist.||1
Which makes no goddamn sense! Just how athletic was he??? Did we all just not notice, because he's still Top 5 most athletic guys in the league right now.|OKC Hornets|1
The incredible amount of negative bias being thrown his way through the media didn't help the perception.|Grizzlies|3
His athleticism is like his stat sheet. He so frequently does the incredible that it quickly began looking normal to people. Lebron wasn\'t in the league very long before the reaction to his insane athleticism turned from "oh my god, how is that possible." to something like "oh, Lebron did something insane again, neat."||7
I think KD goes through the same thing. He\'s just so efficient, people are like "oh okay, no biggie". Which isnweord|OKC Hornets|5

They can't afford that max contract ass anyway|[DEN] Emmanuel Mudiay|164
Is Barnes really going to get a max deal? I know his max is considerably less than someone like lebron or KD, but damn, Harrison Barnes getting a max? I feel like he's been a huge disappointment in the NBA but he's just found a niche on the dubs right now. I feel like he's on the same level as Jeff Green and there's no way in hell Jeff Green gets a max deal.||68
I have to say I love the green comparison. They both seem to have all the talent and ability to do amazing and are just meh. Barnes is more consistent tho. |[NBA] Lebron James|-1
The cap changing means, yes, he will get a max contract. Look at how much TT made, and as many people say he's not worth that much, he would have gotten something close wherever he went because teams are just throwing money around right now anticipating the cap jumps.\n\nAnd he's been pretty solid, just hasn't been the superstar a lot of people thought he could be.|Cavaliers|1
Honestly he's really impressed me in these playoffs. He really seems to step up when his teamates are playing poorly. He's also a great defender and is versatile. Could play 2-4 and can shoot well. That's just so valuable in today's nba. The cavs would be better off with him instead of Love. Love is the better player on a team where he's the 1 or 2 option but Barnes could fit on any team |Cavaliers Bandwagon|1
I don't know why I thought this account was u/Rabsho's alternate account|Jazz|1
I respectfully disagree. Harrison Barnes is a damn near complete offensive weapon who plays on the same team as two of the best shooters possibly ever. Barnes shoots a respectable percentage from 3, is great at finishing around the rim, can post effectively against guys his size or smaller, moves well without the ball, and has hops for days. The biggest knock on him is probably his FT shooting. Harrison Barnes is more polished now than Jeff Green will ever be. I'd say he is as good if not better than DeMar DeRozan. I think he scores in the low 20s or higher on a team where he's the first or second option. ||2
he doesn't deserve to be the first option on any team  in the playoffs this year. for that matter what team would he be the second option on? maybe Memphis, dallas, insert shitty eastern conference team here? |Trail Blazers|1
Tristan Thompson got a max, so anything is possible.|Raptors|2
Good small forwards are hard to come by and Barnes is only 24 with finals experience. That's the ultimate recipe for a max contract in my opinion |Pistons|4
The thing is he will be the highest paid player on our team by far and it might not sit well with some players.|[GSW] Draymond Green|2
i don't understand contracts anymore and i feel like in a few years we will look back on some really bad deals this year. it's like ww1 too much firepower and no idea how to use it.|Wizards|9
He doesn't *deserve* a max deal, but he'll get one. The money is so crazy nowadays, someone's gonna be willing to pay.\n\nPlus, with the huge new TV deal, and the salary cap going up soon, *and* because 50% of the NBA revenue has to go the players, some teams are gonna have so much money coming in while being so far under the cap that they'll essentially get penalized for spending *too little* money. So, if you you have money that you HAVE to spend, why not throw it at a max deal to ensure you get the player you want? Sure, you're technically overpaying him, but you'll take a hit if you don't spend that cash, so there's no reason to pay him less. \n\nIt's just how the NBA is going nowadays, there's literally more money than the league knows what to do with. ||55
The nba is choosing the WRONG time to make a TV deal and it will backfire. ESPN is down like 300% in ratings pr something lately and subscriptions are way down too.|[UTA] Rudy Gobert|0
Not sure if you have been living under a rock or what, but NBA already made a new TV deal and it's amazing for the NBA money wise and started already for this season.\n\nhttp://www.sbnation.com/2014/10/5/6916597/nba-new-tv-deal-espn-turner-24-billion\n\nIt will be awhile before they make a new deal.|Mavericks|1
Oh they just get a lump sum that is a good move, if they made a percentage of the viewership then that would be a terrible move. Honestly Turner is gonna lose money on this one |[UTA] Rudy Gobert|1
>...there's literally more money than the league knows what to do with.\n\nOh I don't know...maybe lower ticket prices?  But I'm just spit ballin' here.  ||38
Or just stop resell on tickets, face value isn't that bad. ||1
Don't ticket prices have to do with supply and demand? Besides, it's been proven that lowering ticket prices won't help the common man since the vast majority are bought up by professional scalpers and sold at market price anyways.||17
I think that's reliant on the market. Wizards tickets are always cheap, and even when they started balling, resale wasn't ridiculous.|OKC Hornets|1
I think this is heavily dependent on the venue. The Hawks were really guilty of jacking up prices as the team did better the past couple years, and I get it, but I don't get half-empty games with tickets being released in staggered sets to make the game appear closer to sold out.||1
If they  really gave a fuck they'd put mechanisms in place to curb that|Cavaliers|8
For teams that sell out sure.  But for some other teams, who I see no need to name here, they should lower their prices just to get people in buying concessions.  But they don't want to embarrass themselves with 99\xc2\xa2 tickets.|76ers|9
But that's the thing though. People don't go to those games cause the team sucks and tickets costs so much. Lowering the price increases demand there by increasing value for scalpers to get involved. ||1
I was watching a Utah local stream and the deals were insane - like 4 pizzas and four tickets for 60 bucks. Only problem is now you're in the middle of Utah. Isn't Nevada right beside Utah? Why would ya stay in Utah. Isn't it a desert with draconian laws about alcohol etc?||3
Not really. Utah has the same liquor laws as 13 other states in the country. They're admittedly stupid, but with those liquor and gambling laws comes higher average income, higher college graduates per 1000, lower crime rate, affordable housing, and a sustained economic growth due to all the available degreed talent. Also we have Google Fiber. ||5

>8 assists \n\n> selfish, not a point guard \n\nKyrie "Westbrook" Irving \n\n\nEdit : of course Westbrook is better |[HOU] James Harden|116
Wait is this a real debate, do people think Kyrie Irving is better than Westbrook?|Heat|1
No |[HOU] James Harden|3
Westbrook is in another universe defensively, as a driver, and has always been a much much better passer than Irving. Kyrie's career high assists per game is 6. Westbrook averaged over 10 this year and his worst seasons as a passer are just a bit worse than Kyries best. Kyrie really is a below average passer, which is where the Westbrook comparison falls flat.\n\nKyrie was never unfairly maligned as a passer, he's been below average as far as creating offense from day 1.|Pacers|1
Westbrook has the same defensive flaws as Kyrie actually. He relies too much on athleticism and instinct. He is constantly out of position and ball watching in hopes of stepping into the passing lane. Both have slow feet in picks and suffer tracking off ball movement.\n\nNeither are good defenders, but Westbrook certainly has better court vision and shot creation for teammates. Complete agreement. Kyrie has the better jumper though.|Hawks|17
Kyrie has a better jumper overall but Westbrook's pull up jumper is cash. |Bulls|3
Kyrie's younger tho|Spurs|13
He's missing 8 more boards to be a Westbrook |Thunder|98
And 4 turnovers||1
West had hella low turnovers in a lot of the playoff games.|Thunder|1
Eh Lebron has 5. When you have the ball in your hands for half the game some TO's happen. Westbrook has turned in triple doubles with 0-2 turnovers several times I believe. He's still veering off that reckless side we've seen in the past, but he's improved so much. If we can get him to stop shooting 3's and turn the to's down to 1-2 a game he will be an unstoppable force.|Thunder|3
I like him shooting 3s. He said he's gonna put a lot of practise into it now too.|Thunder|2
I'm perfectly fine with that, if it is reflected in his percentage. If he goes up 5% I'm down to let him shoot them like he does now. |Thunder|2

Cavs backs were against the wall, this was the game they needed play to win. There were two moments during the game where us making 2 points after 5 minutes felt like a consolation prize. |[GSW] Klay Thompson|7
Yeah, I think Curry was injured too.|Raptors|18
Clearly tonight Steph was only at 70%|Cavaliers|21
same can be said about game 1 & 2 cavs misses tbh but we'll just see what happens next|Cavaliers|13
Everytime the warriors lose someone says this||48
.........and it's true every time.|Lakers|-38
Cavs defense was smothering tonight man. Y'all tripping. Did you watch all those blocked shots and forced turnovers in the first half? |Cavaliers Bandwagon|23
Severe dropoff in the number of backdoor cuts and second chance tips GS was getting in the first two games, but yeah the Cavs didn't play good D.......\n\nThose dudes are nuts.|Cavaliers|18
Plus so many Warriors possessions ended in a forced shot with the shot clock winding down. Great defensive effort by the Cavs. |Cavaliers Bandwagon|15
Lmao I can recognize a swarming defense when I see it. Were there shots that Warriors could have made? Yeah of course, but Cavs closed out on a lot of open looks.|Warriors|25
And that's how they should defend from now on. The Pistons played their best defence against LA back in 2004, every damn game.||6
The only thing is that the Cavs starters were playing a lot of minutes throughout the first three quarters. I wonder if they could keep it up over a seven game series. OKC got really worn out towards the end there and it definitely seemed like a factor in them not being able to close out games 6 and 7. |Warriors|7
Then their bench should work. That's the reason why they're in the NBA: to fucking play.||1

He went crazy on snapchat because people were surprised he could dunk, and then proceeded to find highlights of himself dunking over the years lol. Man's got hops. |Cavaliers|1
He's looking pretty good this series. Quite surprised.||1
Wait I am not sure if you're being sarcastic but he went on a little mini rant on snapchat a few weeks ago about how people were surprised he can still dunk. I am not sure if that's what you're referring to but yeah|Cavaliers Bandwagon|2
Last time he dunked he talked about it on snapchat. "Why is everybody freaking out over me dunking? Yes, I\'m old. Yes, I can still dunk." Then he took a snap of this video from earlier this season as proof: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrWwBwpvjC4|[OKC] Russell Westbrook|5

that's bullshit they called an offensive foul on that...everyone knows the rule is you only call the offensive foul if the player doesn't finish on the dunk!||9
RJ was freakishly athletic in his prime. I remember him leaping entirely over another player to block a shot at Arizona.\n\nEdit: I just assume things from back then don't exist, but [here it is.](http://youtu.be/exH_fnZ_j7o)|NBA|187

Kobe once jumped over lamar odom to block a guy, but last time i saw him he only got off the ground a few inches. Don't sleep on father time.|Lakers|7
Kobe also started playing in the league when he was 17. Think it was Bill Simmons that once wanted to coin a stat for number of jumps a player has made in their career to measure wear and tear. Kobe's probably like 50,000 jumps clear of second place on that list. |[MIN] Andrew Wiggins|11
yeah I remember those Net's teams, he always had big dunks. BUT HE OLD NOW. |[GSW] Klay Thompson|15
Yeah, same thing with Iggy, though. They don't have crazy athleticism now, just athleticism.|NBA|21

"Burn them all," the king kept saying. "Burn them all." I don\'t think he expected to die. He meant to burn with the rest of us and rise again reborn as a Heat and turn his enemies to ash.

it's a fair point.  Currys +/- this season was like -9 or something, Greens was 11, Lebrons was like +13.  granted those are small samples sizes but still||1
That screenshot should be a picture in the sidebar ||2
What the fuck really?|Cavaliers|3
Thanks for the source, amazing |Suns|2
I feel like we should be jealous of the man with a billion dollar endorsement deal and is still the best player in the league.  Once Steph can play defense at Lebrons level then we can talk.||2

If the Cavs win the championship, a comment merely stating "fuck curry" will probably be the most upvoted, gilded comment not only in the post game thread, but in this sub\'s history. Been known this sub is absolutely fucked||3

Pshhh it's like the opposite. I definitely saw Steph staring at Lebron this series with his dark chocolately skin, broad shoulders, manly hair line, and handsome smile. It's killing him. |Bulls|3
you know you have to post that shit|[NYK] Amar'e Stoudemire|3
The sad thing is, I'm pretty sure I saw worse comments than that the past few days.. |[NBA] Lebron James|3
Bulls fans and Lakers fans. Figures.\n\nLakers fans try to take Lebron down to defend Kobe's legacy - few of them if any accept that Lebron was the better player and ranks higher on the GOAT standings.\n\nBulls fans are less insecure about Jordan's legacy, but they still didn't get over Lebron not choosing Chicago in 2010 and then turning their prince into a pumpkin in the 2011 playoffs.|[MIA] Dwyane Wade|5
In order to enjoy this sub I have to take a lot of comments lightly and find the humor. I'm a Warriors fan, but I'm a basketball fan first. I'll shit talk plenty, but come on man. I just have to laugh when I read ridiculous comments based on such a limited scope of experience. It's LeBron James for fucks sake. The man has earned his place in NBA history as one of the greats and is by no means past his prime. Trash talk is one thing, but to actually make serious statements like that and try to stand by it is just delusional. ||5

Lol, I find it funny you took it personal enough to remember my username a 4 days later and link it. Warriors haven't won a game 3 all year, and couldn't hit a open shot to save their life. Congrats on finally winning I guess?\n\nAlso I went back and looked at my comment, to be sure. I said Wiggins had a better future then the Cavaliers organization since we are quoting me. BTW I feel honored bud|Kings|-60

>Yet 77 other people upvoted my original statement...you're beginning to look a tad bitter.  \n\nThese were your words when I disagreed with you. Now I'm at 171 and you're at -16. So what does your logic tell you now?   \n\nI use different logic: don't say stupid shit and you won't get called out in front of the whole sub later. |Cavaliers|21
Well, this is /r/nba. You forget when I said that, Warriors were up 2-0. Now Cleveland finally one and you took your time to point out my comment from when Warriors were dominating. So, it seems you are doing the same exact thing I supposedly did. Funny how it works, lets see what this sub says after game 4. |Kings|-3
Actually, if you look at my comment history, you'll notice that I've mentioned several times how quickly the narrative changes in this sub. You'll also note several times that I don't expect the Cavs to win the Finals, looking at it strictly objectively. This is related to the argument I put forth against you the other day--my accusation was that you were riding the DAE CLEVELAND SUCKS narrative and overreacting. And you were. So you don't really have anything to take away from me here.  \n\nSo go ahead, go through my post history. |Cavaliers|2
I don't know where you are getting this idea where I actually care enough to look through your post history. |Kings|-3

Of course. The crowd changes daily.|NBA|331
This right here. Shit gets toxic, and I tend to take a few days off after a playoff loss. Then when the Cavs win, we all come out of the fucking woodwork while GSW fans sink a bit. That's most of what that is. Fans - I'd guess - don't really like hanging out and reading about their team getting shit on, so the Cavs fans aren't downvoting shit like that as much, because we're not in the threads as much when they lose.|[CLE] Kyrie Irving|18
Very good point. When it gets down to two teams, it\'s like fan bases take turns running /r/nba and then when the other team wins again, they come back and look around saying, "This is what /r/nba thinks! They\'re all stupid, obviously", and then proceed to do the very same thing the first team was doing.|Warriors Bandwagon|6

Feels just like the Cleveland/Toronto series.  Each team plays great at home.  Just comes down to who loses a home game first.  It\'s why people kept saying "the series isn\'t over" after 2 games.  |Charlotte Hornets|2
They got back home for their first Finals game and played with a lot of heart and pride. Kudos to them for playing as well as they did. All of the pressure was on them to just compete tonight and Friday isn't as daunting as they now have a chance to tie the series instead of fighting of elimination.|Magic|2

This is what I was feeling. If you look at the first games in the series Klay/Curry haven't been having a dominating performance but by all means the Warriors are a good team with some great bench players. But the Cavaliers looked like they really didn't want to play at all. Maybe, being home brought out some fire in them.||4

I\'ve finally finished mourning my Thunder, so I\'ve decided to do more write-ups in honor of the Finals. But I hadn\'t seen enough of the Cavs playing to make honest and informed critiques. Thankfully, I get to do that on a Cavs game that wasn\'t a total wash! Notes:\n\n* We\'ll start with the coaching. I honestly think Kerr got severely outcoached by James this round. Kidding. But seriously, Lue was much improved tonight. I\'m not sure if it was the home court getting guys comfortable in their game again, but I saw much improved switching, communication on both ends. He finally got his guys ready to play. \n\n* Kerr\'s coaching was also improved. He was prodding and tinkering to see how Lue would react. Unfortunately, there\'s no real adjustment to shots falling. That being said, he did a lot in order to see Steph getting a little in his groove after halftime. Backcuts off baseline screens and lots of curling, while using Livingston dropping to the elbow as a magnet for guards is pretty ingenious. \n\n*  Speaking of Steph, he took a while to wake up. Like 2.5 quarters. Yeah his shot started falling, but if you look more closely, you saw him getting a lot of the offball asswhooping that he got playing OKC. Bumping, prodding, checking, slapping, pushing: all of it seems to get him out of his rhythm and firmly into his own way. And when he\'s in his own way, like so many other greats, that\'s when he seems mortal. Taking that long in the Finals cannot happen. \n\n* I was really impressed by both Draymond and Klay. It\'s a shame that Dray is probably a shoe-in for the FMVP if the Warriors win, because Klay has been doing that thing all series where he singlehandedly puts the team on his back and hits stupid, ill-advised, JR Smith caliber shots at an insane clip. \n\n* That\'s not to belittle Draymond\'s game: he\'s been very good defensively. Notice that once he was no longer guarding LeBron, his jumper started falling again. Hopefully thats a causality that Lue looks into, but I don\'t have the analytics in front of me. \n\n* I hate to make another OKC comparison, but I have to--the Cavs finally brought their defense. More importantly, they used that defense to create offense, letting fast breaks come out of shattered posessions on the other end. Smart, and simultaneously breaks their overrealiance on iso-sets, and Kyrie playing off the dribble against Iggy/Livingston/Klay. \n\n* List of teams of fans that I saw trashing LeBron: Bulls (stop it), Dubs (expected), Nuggets (stop it again), Lakers (Boi).

He\'s not wearing the bandage, and suddenly he\'s slinging pipe and sipping Hennesey during timeouts. Coincidence? I think not. \n\n* Igoudala is probably one of the most underrated fucking defenders I\'ve ever seen. Seriously. Watch him work. He has Pippen caliber hands, he\'s remarkably aware of his own body in space, his timing is (terrifyingly) better than Draymond\'s, and he knows how to use his weight, and how to balance it to avoid fouling.\n\n* I know it\'s not smart to use singular events to make decisions, but honestly, Jefferson might need to start, the same way Kerr hasn\'t been afraif to start Igoudala. His defense has been magnificent, his heart has been great, and his PnR switches are nothing to shake a stick at. \n\n* Bogut was a bit of a liability tonight. Not tremendous, in my opinion, because at least he wasn\'t getting stupid fouls, but he was getting handled on the boards, and was slow to get back. Last game\'s block party has been shut down by Officer Thompson. \n\n* Tristan Thompson had a fantastic game. Still not worth 80m\'s though. Sorry. Had to be said. \n\n* Harrison Barnes plays games like there\'s a combo meter in his brain that fills up with good plays, and when it fills up, he wins a max contract. \n\n* Pop Quiz: Who is the best two way player in th-- LeBron. The answer is LeBron. If you said Klay, or Dray, or anyone else, welcome to the Mark Jackson School of Half-Baked Analysis. \n\n* LeBron time. Honestly, LeBron\'s biggest problem is that he makes it look easy. We don\'t compare him to his peers, we compare him to the likes of Jordan and Kobe and the Big O. Yeah he\'s lost 4 times in the Finals--because he\'s good enough to get there 7 times, 6 consecutively. That\'s more than your franchise. Damn sure more than my franchise. He\'s averaging damn near a triple double AGAIN, and we say he needs to step up. And he did, by bringing back his jumper, while making players quiver on the other end. \n\n* Kevin Love is a top 5 player at his position, and I hope he heals from his concussion without adverse effects. It is a shame to not be able to play in the Finals and have to be left with "What ifs", especially 2 years in a row. \n\n* Homecourt this year has been absolutely monstrous for teams. For anyone who says shit like "regular season doesn\'t mean anything" I promise you wish your team had more home games in a series this year. I know we do. \n\n* Trapping was magnificent on the Cavs side, while the Dubs were great switching and digging through screens. \n\n* Props on both teams for their mental toughness: GSW didn\'t get lazy. Cavs didn\'t come out softer than Twinkie filling. Props all around. \n\nThe Cavs are finally looking like who we thought they\'d be, while the Dubs are still capable of making a 20+ point deficit look tiny. Next game will determine if this was an aberration or not, for both teams. Only time will tell. We got a series, folks!\n\nP.S. On some folks suggestion I\'ll post an amended and updated version in the NDT tomorrow. \n|Thunder|1672

LeBron is the best two way player, *when he wants to be*. Curry shouldn't have pissed him off. Bogut was getting beat, but Ezeli, Varejao and Speights were as well.

Brain fart. My bad|Thunder|2
No worries! :) I always feel like I won something when I find things like that. ||5
Iggy's resurgence on the defensive end has been a real surprise since last year in the playoffs. I don't remember him ever playing this good defense when he was younger, and yeah Iggy is a better defender than Draymond. \n\nPeople who write off LBJ too easily, this guy's a lock for the Hall of Fame and probably top 10 if not top 5 players in the history of the game. A lot of people are jumping to conclusions saying the Warriors have 3 potential future Hall of Famers, I'm sorry, but the only person on the Warriors that has a shot is probably Curry. Klay, maybe if the Warriors win more championships like MJ and Pippen did, but Pippen was a fantastic second option next to MJ. Pippen was one of the best perimeter defenders and was consistent offensively. Klay is not as good defensively and he disappears more often than he should. And Draymond. Lol. Yeah he's good, but he's definitely not a Hall of Famer, especially now. It may change in the next 5 years, but he's not getting it. |Lakers|3
Thanks man I read every word. Quality stuff.\n\nGotta say too that Kyrie needs to step up like this every time for them to keep winning. Lebron definitely puts the team on his shoulders but Kyrie gives Lebron wings so they all can fly. \n\nI see this going in 6 to the Dubs just because their shooting is unworldly. |Lakers|3

lol bless|Thunder|1
With respect to the coaching changes that were made, I don't feel as though the Cavs did all that much differently than they have all playoffs. It looked like they were taking the same shots from the same formation as previously, but this time they went it. Also LeBron finally drove to the hole and used his strength to get baskets. That opened up EVERYTHING in their offense. As a Hawks fan I saw this game play too much from the Cavs. Once they got their confidence back and the crowd was in it, especially with that alley-oop, there was no stopping the Cavs. Energy on both sides with their physicality at an all time high. \n\nBut can they do it again? My biased answer is no. Warriors are too good and I'm not nervous. OKC looked better in each game than Cleveland has shown thus far, even tonight's game. I'll wait until after game 4 to see what Cleveland is really all about. |[ATL] Kent Bazemore|4
It's a make or miss league. Klay misses half those bullshit shots in G6 *twitches* we'd be in the Finals right now. I do think that it was a product of execution, rather than luck, but as always, in a series, consistency is key. We'll see|Thunder|2
> We'll start with the coaching. I honestly think Kerr got severely outcoached by James this round. Kidding. But seriously, Lue was much improved tonight. I'm not sure if it was the home court getting guys comfortable in their game again, but I saw much improved switching, communication on both ends. He finally got his guys ready to play.\n> \n\nHe's always had the plays and ability. Playing at the Q forces the issue and makes the players see what they're playing for. LeBron also flashed his dick at the Q once, so it's a great home court.\n\n>Kerr's coaching was also improved. He was prodding and tinkering to see how Lue would react. Unfortunately, there's no real adjustment to shots falling. That being said, he did a lot in order to see Steph getting a little in his groove after halftime. Backcuts off baseline screens and lots of curling, while using Livingston dropping to the elbow as a magnet for guards is pretty ingenious.\n>\n\nHe still needs to respond to Tristan Thompson and Kyrie Irving's High Pick and Roll. It's so effective, and has worked extremely well throughout the series, either by freeing Kyrie to crash to the basket or take a midrange gimme shot, or by transitioning the ball to LeBron on the strongside to iso in a great position. \n\n>Speaking of Steph, he took a while to wake up. Like 2.5 quarters. Yeah his shot started falling, but if you look more closely, you saw him getting a lot of the offball asswhooping that he got playing OKC. Bumping, prodding, checking, slapping, pushing: all of it seems to get him out of his rhythm and firmly into his own way. And when he's in his own way, like so many other greats, that's when he seems mortal. Taking that long in the Finals cannot happen.\n>\n\nIt's not so much the shot wasn't falling -- he got some great steals and his head was in the game. I think the issue is that he wasn't willing to just go balls to the wall and consume usage, and when he passed off to other teammates, they were immediately swarmed. He was played exactly as LeBron was in Game 2\n\n>I was really impressed by both Draymond and Klay. It's a shame that Dray is probably a shoe-in for the FMVP if the Cavs win, because Klay has been doing that thing all series where he singlehandedly puts the team on his back and hits stupid, ill-advised, JR Smith caliber shots at an insane clip.\n>\n\nImho, the Warriors can't win without Dray in terms of defensive coverage. Klay Thompson's fuck you threes cost us Game 1, but it wasn't like Klay's been the main focus of the defense thus far in the series. Livingstone and Draymond have really opened us up allowing Klay to excel. He bricked a lot tonight without those guys performing well.\n\n\n>That's not to belittle Draymond's game: he's been very good defensively. Notice that once he was no longer guarding LeBron, his jumper started falling again. Hopefully thats a causality that Lue looks into, but I don't have the analytics in front of me.\n>\n\nDraymond excels in transition threes and exploiting mismatches -- Cavs had better defensive rotation and kept the tempo in their favor today. When he switched off LeBron, the tempo slowed down a bit, letting him shoot more efficient shots. Still, Lue definetly targeted Draymond today\n\n>I hate to make another OKC comparison, but I have to--the Cavs finally brought their defense. More importantly, they used that defense to create offense, letting fast breaks come out of shattered posessions on the other end. Smart, and simultaneously breaks their overrealiance on iso-sets, and Kyrie playing off the dribble against Iggy/Livingston/Klay.\n>\n\nReally the similarity comes from defensive intensity, as well as Kyrie being able to hit outside shots and midrange pullups, very similar to Russel Westbrook's performance in the series. It's just playing good tough basketball, though the Thunder really excelled at making the Warriors test their rim protector in Ibaka, and we've done well to force awkward shots from low efficiency zones\n\n>List of teams of fans that I saw trashing LeBron: Bulls (stop it), Dubs (expected), Nuggets (stop it again), Lakers (Boi). Cut the malarky, people.\nList of teams of fans that I saw trashing Steph: OKC (guys...), Bulls (stop it again), Cavs (expected), Lakers (leave), Pistons (#fuckReggie).>\n\nIdk about the Curry hate, but I've seen *insane* LeBron hate recently. Some guy was heavily upvoted when he said LeBron really isn't a top 15 player and that MJ would always be the GOAT. Another guy was at +2 when he said Steph Curry is the GOAT. A lot of really horrible comments about how they wish he'd never win another ring, especially in Cleveland, and some shockingly mean comments about Cleveland. I'd imagine the same has happened for the Warrior fans and Steph Curry, and I'm glad you pointed it out -- it's exceptionally sucky to the reddit experience and I'm glad you pointed it out\n\n>Igoudala is probably one of the most underrated fucking defenders I've ever seen. Seriously. Watch him work. He has Pippen caliber hands, he's remarkably aware of his own body in space, his timing is (terrifyingly) better than Draymond's, and he knows how to use his weight, and how to balance it to avoid fouling.\n>\n\nHe'd absolutely still be an all-star if he played on any other team or wanted more minutes. He's such an anomaly in sports history -- a top-30 player taking such a low deal to just winnnnn. \n\n\n> Tristan Thompson had a fantastic game. Still not worth 80m's though. Sorry. Had to be said.\n> \n\nIt was either pay this guy 80m or sign some other dude for much less. Thompson is better than the replacement player and has gotten us wins over replacement. While we paid a premium for those wins, it's not the worst thing in the world. Offensive Rebounds are like three point shots in so far that analytics really likes them and they don't get enough attention in game plans. If Tristan gets 5-6 extra possesions to score on and we capitalize on 4-5, we add 10-15 points to the box score, and that's the difference between a win and a loss.|[CLE] Mark Price|12

I don't think it was garbage time... We're shallow on big man depth with Varejao gone and the K Love injury. He was running P&R with Kyrie... Unless Kyrie plays garbage time now...\n\nAlso, T-Mo looked pretty solid out there tonight. I'd like to see him get some time when Bogut's out there because TT is having a hard time with him.|Cavaliers|1

Well, the game was over by then. But seriously it was such a good rotational move by Lue to put Frye and Mozgov out there at that time. I think Speights and Ezeli had just checked in and the Cavs went even bigger and it paid off. |Supersonics|118
In all honesty Mozgov's size to neutralize Festus athleticism was one of the best subs I've seen Ty Lue pull. Kerr would've smiled at that one. ||62

I'm confused about this series, the first two games and even this game the cavs go through phases where it looks like they forgot how to basketball. They miss layups, play no defense, stand around and get destroyed. Then tonight for most of the game, they ran the Warriors off the court. As a true fan of the game, it's an interesting situation but I prefer the battles where games go back and forth and aren't 20 point blow outs. ||4

I hate the people that complain about cherry picked stats but that is a little bit cherry picked |Bulls|0
He was hitting jumpers. It was scary.|Cavaliers|1
Must admit I am surprised that Bird isn't there||1
seems like he mostly fed off his teammates, his 1st half was pretty atrocious but when the cavs gained a lead he started playing like lebron and closed the game strong |Mavericks|1
I always hate when people do that. 32/11/6 is a bit arbitrary to compare. Somebody might have had 30/15/15 or 45/10/10 but nope, he's not good enough, one of the numbers is not over these random lines we decided to draw. ||1
Such a pigeonholed stat|[LAL] Sasha Vujacic|1
Holy shit that Duncan line though (sorry, couldn't help but focus on that as a Spurs fan). 32/20/6/3/7 with only 1 turnover on 11/17 and 10/14 from the line. Highest game score of anybody with a stat line in these parameters. Dude straight carried that '03 team, no question|[SAS] Danny Green|1
Wait Rashard Lewis was *that* good? I knew he was a good player, didn't know he could put up numbers like that.|Lakers|1

god damn it i need a trigger warning for Rashad Lewis|[CLE] Mark Price|1
And all the previous LeBron entries on that list are from last year's finals. Cavs went 2-2 in those games. LeBron played so well in last year's finals.\n\nInteresting that one of the Shaq performances and the Rashard performance were for Orlando in losses. Fuck.|Magic|2
LeBron played similarly last year\'s Finals, and yet Iguodala got NBA Finals MVP for "defending" him lmfao|NBA|2
He shot very inefficiently though with his monster numbers. But it is kinda who gets the award if you beat LeBron in the Finals. Kawhi got it in 2014 and LeBron still put up 28/8/4 on 57% shooting. Then of course Iggy got it in 2015. Curious if things keep up with the way Curry is playing if GSW wins the series if it'll be someone like Draymond. |Heat|6
[deleted]||2
No lol. I'm pretty sure he started the game 4/4.|Raptors|1
Probably the most impressive thing I saw from him tonight. He **kept** attacking the rim even if a lot of his drives he usually makes weren't falling. Didn't settle for his jumpshot, knew he didn't have it in his arsenal(at least tonight) and it paid off for him. Cleveland played well which many expected at home, now we'll see what happens with Kyrie/Curry.|Heat|1
I didn't watch the game, but everyone was talking about how he played like shit in the game thread.|Raptors|3
He had a rough 2nd quarter. Was great the other 3. |Cavaliers|1
all those games for bron were when he was in the cavs. never did it on the heat. that's interesting. |Nuggets|45
And all of them were from last year's Finals. 4 games of 32/11/6 in one series is fucking impressive.|Lakers|1
Never had to go that hard with the heat on both sides of the floor.|Heat|2
Averaged more than that last year lol||3
He had better teams with the Heat|Spurs|64

I'm just glad people aren't bringing up more shade stats that always emerge when they lose.||3
Rashard.. I didn't expect to hurt tonight..|Magic|49
Lebron played like Lebron tonight. |[GSW] Leandro Barbosa|354
Just 1 assist away from a big LeBron!|Cavaliers|1
I actually think he could have played even better. Not sure what it was, but it seemed like every time he drove on his defender he ended up slipping or losing control of the ball.|Cavaliers|2
Lebron played like Rashard Lewis tonight.||4
especially after curry pulled that CP3 shit, it really pissed off Bron.|[GSW] Klay Thompson|94
link me bro I had to watch bits and pieces of the game due to a bit of an emergency|Cavaliers|2
Cp3 shit? Elaborate?|Cavaliers|19
CP3 has a number of legal "maneuvers" or moves that get under my skin. One of them is the "get in your defenders way with the ball and make him run me over for a foul while in transition." Curry did the opposite of that, the "make excessive contact off ball while going down the court and ultimately flop and draw a foul."|[GSW] Klay Thompson|79
Oh okay. Just wondering do you know when that happened? I'd like to see. |Cavaliers|2
it was sometime in the beginning of the third I want to say? Right before LeBron made about 4 jumpers in a row. |[GSW] Klay Thompson|7
he kinda locked up arms with lebron and pulled lebron into himself then fell over. was a bitch ass move|76ers|57
And announcers didn't even talk about it..|Cavaliers|21
"They were tangled up. It was always gonna be called." Then why not call a foul on Curry Mark Jackson you dumbfuck|[DET] Richard Hamilton|26
he's still biased in favor of his his former players. you can clearly hear it|Heat|2
It was a pretty dumb move from Curry, near the end of the clip it looked like his shoulder could have been twisted. |Cavaliers|8
Curry doing that shit is some of the most frustrating shit ever, too. haha|Cavaliers|43
**30** **POINT**  **WIN** **!** I sincerely hope Lue does what is necessary and starts RJ on Friday. The difference in the first two games and tonight is nuts. This is the NBA Finals and we don\xe2\x80\x99t have time to worry about how Kevin Love will feel if Lue brings him off the bench. He can still contribute, but I say start RJ and try to stagger Love & Kyrie so we don\xe2\x80\x99t have those stretches where our defense looks like total dog shit. |Cavaliers|90
This is actually a sound plan. Helps with the defense, and you also get someone off the bench who can score.|Warriors|1
They should get a defending forward at the end of this year||2
RJ over Kevin Love in the Finals. And it makes sense. Mind fucking blown. |[GSW] Andre Iguodala|5

* The most impressive stat to me was halfway through the 3rd Quarter Golden State hadn't cracked 50 points. \n\n* Cavs forced a good amount of GSW's 18 turnovers\n\n* GSW FT% was ass\n\n* GSW 3Pt% was ass\n\n* T-Thomps with the OReb like whoah\n\n* I think everyone likes when LeBron plays well. When he puts up 18-10-8 I hate it. I'd rather the star score a shit ton. Maybe that's bad basketball, but it's why I watch the NBA. |Lakers|58
And DubNation saying they can beat the 96 Bulls, with a much better offence and defence and rebounding with MJ and Pip. Lol||4

My money is on GS adjusting, winning Friday and then finishing it at home in game 5||3
Seriously so many blowouts you check out early. This is the finals and I am checking out early because of how bad these blowouts have been. Crazy stuff. What is with homecourt advantage this year?|[OKC] Russell Westbrook|45
well at least at worst there will be only 2 more games you can check out early for. \n\nbut sadly that would only leave 2 at most Finals games that you end up watching entirely. |Warriors|2
#SmallBall|Lakers|12
I think every team has quit so far if they're down 20 towards the middle of the third|[WAS] John Wall|11
So besides the circlejerk going the other way now, Lebron had 2 awful games for his standard and people shit all over him the last two days. So are we allowed to talk about Curry having three bad games without being downvoted into oblivion?|Magic|179
Curry had 1 bad game and 2 games where he did what his team needed for them to win|Wizards|-1
the narrative was mostly about kyrie & love being terrible, and how lebron yet again has no help. game 2 people did get on him for the turnovers tho.\n\nbut yeah curry did have an incredibly bad game 3 (and a pretty bad game 1)|Bulls|1
I mean, this gets said every time Curry has a bad game. Check every post game thread and someone has said something to this effect with a decent amount of upvotes like yourself.\n\nIf y'all really want to shit on him, then shit on him. He has not been an MVP caliber player these past 3 games. I would not be surprised if someone submitted an above average analysis of his play and it got plenty of traction on here.|Warriors|2
The reason people have been saying this stuff is because there are a lot of people that would try to argue that Steph has overtaken Lebron for the title of best player in the league, yet people aren't putting him under nearly as much scrutiny. If Lebron played like Steph has these first few games or at other times during the playoffs, he'd be getting absolutely crucified. \n\nI sat through a decade of people constantly moving the goalposts to talk shit about Lebron. I accepted it before as something that comes with being the best, but now it seems like Curry is getting the best of both worlds.|Cavaliers|10
You see what you wanna see. Most people would probably argue that KD or Westbrook are the best players in the league. Steph is easily the best shooter in the league. \n\nLebron, well Lebron is good at fast break dunking and using his size properly when he's not flopping for easy fouls. Dude is a good PF but that's it.|Lakers|-5
Come on, that's ridiculous. You're literally the only person I've ever heard express that opinion. Durant hasn't even been a consensus top 2 since his MVP year. Most people would probably slot both him and Westbrook somewhere between 3-5. \n\nLeBron and Curry are the top 2 right now and it's basically undisputed. |Cavaliers|3
Personal opinion. I just don't think Lebron is that all around good. |Lakers|1
Your personal opinion aside though, that\'s definitely not "what most people would argue". |Cavaliers|1
that's why its an argument|Lakers|0
"Most people would say" was posed as a factual statement, not a just your ridiculous opinion. |Cavaliers Bandwagon|3
No, most people wouldn't. This is the most idiotic statement ever. |Cavaliers Bandwagon|3
Genuine question. Do you think that the scrutiny players like Lebron and Kobe had to sit through for years was justified? All the "Le-Choke," "Ballhog," "Selfish," "GM Lebron" comments whether that be on reddit or ESPN and TNT.|Warriors|2
Not really. Some of the criticisms had some truth to them, but in general people have been way too hard on them based on 90% jealousy. I was definitely guilty of it in Kobe's prime. But once Kobe turned into a significantly less scary old man he got nothing but respect from everyone. I imagine the same thing will happen to Lebron as he declines.\n\nI'm not saying Steph deserves to be criticized so heavily per se. I'm just kind of annoyed the media is being so inconsistent.|Cavaliers|8
He simply isn't held to the same standard.  There was a time when LeBron would have been chastised if his team won a finals and he didn't get MVP.|Cavaliers|11
That's what happens when you wanna be considered the all around GOAT |Lakers|2
Lebron is the better player. You usually criticize the better player. ||175
Here's the thing. LeBron is soooooo valuable, and you see guys like KD and Steph Curry and Rose win the MVP award, but tbh, he's the *best* in the game|[CLE] Mark Price|15
I agree he is the better player, but besides that were not allowed to criticize the first unanimous MVP?|Magic|121
Curry was a decoy when he wasnt making shots.|Vancouver Grizzlies|-7
While that's true, and Steph definitely still has significant gravity value even when he's not making shots, he won MVP because he was dropping 30 points on 50/45/90 while hitting almost 5 threes per game. He needs to put the ball in the hole. |Warriors|2
Also lead the league in steals. |Warriors|0
so? this is irrelevant he missed his shots he was supposed to make?|Magic|28
Winning cures a lot of things|Vancouver Grizzlies|1
that it does, also curry is talking during the interview now and said it was all on him and i give him mad respect for owning up to it|Magic|17
A unanimous mvp should never be considered a decoy in my honest opinion. Step up or you deserve to be questioned|[OKC] Russell Westbrook|41
The award was for the regular season. Finals MVP will go to whoever shows up in the next two games. I'm guessing Klay or Draymond|Vancouver Grizzlies|-5
Okay the regular season unanimous mvp shouldn't be a decoy. Doesn't matter if he isn't finals mvp imo he is not playing well to the standard of a mvp in general.|Vancouver Grizzlies|15
It got the dubs two W's in dominating fashion.|Vancouver Grizzlies|-5
Was missing 70% of his shots part of the plan too!?|Vancouver Grizzlies|7
It didn't take defenders off him so it didn't hurt the Warriors in those games.|Vancouver Grizzlies|1
regular season MVP,   this shit isn't regular any more.|Vancouver Grizzlies|4
[deleted]||1
Nope, expectations increase.  The playoffs is completely different than the regular season - its more intense, the refs call it differently, home court is more important, etc etc.  |Vancouver Grizzlies|1
Can i just make the point that if Lebron James had a first half like Curry did, he would be crucified|Celtics|101
Not if he was injured or something. Yeah, he must have been injured. ||13
Every time Curry plays poorly it is assumed he is injured. If Lebron does and is slightly injured people say Jordan would have fought through it and had an even better game.||29
That's because Curry is light-skinned.|[NYK] Kristaps Porzingis|7

Happy the Cavs won, wasn't looking forward to a drought of Richard Jefferson Snapchat stories.|Trail Blazers|25
It was very refreshing not seeing Kevin Love bumbling around the court with zero intensity or heart. Richard Jefferson should get the start over him in game 4. Jefferson has been playing surprisingly solid.\n\nAlso, good to see Kyrie Irving remembered how to play big boy basketball again. Good response from him.|Cavaliers|136
Let's remember though that Kyre was being shat on even more than Kevin before this game about him being a defensive livability.||5
It's still hard to argue against a lineup that won by 30 points. |Spurs|2
I'll be legitimately mad at Lue if he starts Kevin Love again during this series. |Spurs|56
K. Love comes off the bench going 7/8 from 3pt land in the 2nd quarter. \n\ni'm dreaming this tonight.|Cavaliers|110
I think this legit needs to happen. I know you guys won't win by 30 again but obviously this lineup worked a lot better  |[OKC] Russell Westbrook|4
I like that. K Love runs the 2nd unit or something, or it's either K Love or Kyrie on with LeBron. Lue has effective sets for Love and if he's on, let him on, but don't play him above guys who can defend and play with intensity|[CLE] Mark Price|11

Never seen an MVP being as protected as he is. He struggles, something must be wrong. Today they were talking about the refs letting the physical play go so that hindered Curry. I'm like what the hell is all this BS. \n\nLebron has games like what Curry had and it's like murder by the media. ||121
Maybe its because they are up 2-1? Ever think about that?|Warriors|-3
Nah man, if you read the Warriors sub we won because the refs gave us the game because we had more rebounds and FTs...|Cavaliers|0
Probably because curry isn't the size of an NFL linebacker like Lebron is.|Lakers|1
Honestly I think it's because the expectations are always too high with LBJ. If Curry never wins a title again no one will give a shit in 5 years.\n\n|Lakers|5
It's true, their media narratives couldn't be more different.\n\nCurry: small college, undersized, injury plagued, wasn't sure if he could be anything more than a spot-up shooter in the NBA. Any accomplishments he gets just add to the feel-good story. He's *really good* and that's what people have come to expect, but that's about it. He's the star on the best team in NBA history that's shown they can win when he underperforms.\n\nLebron: touted out of high school as the next Kobe or even Jordan. Athletically out of this world, guaranteed #1 pick, poised to be the face of the league for years to come. Greatness was always something that people expected of him, and people's expectations due to his image is that *he's supposed to be legendary*. If he underperforms, especially in Cleveland, no one is really gonna pick up his slack. Thus, expectations are and have been crazy high since Lebron left to Miami to start competing for championships.|Kings|12
I hate to bring it up, but the Dubs are not the best team in history.||6
I agree, but I think his point was just the narrative is that this Dubs team was the greatest team.|Heat|3
Honestly I think it's because the expectations are always too high with LBJ. If Curry never wins a title again no one will give a shit in 5 years.\n\n|Lakers|6

I agree.  You know people are gonna circle jerk about how the Cavs are better without him, but they should really try to not have him and Kyrie on the court together.  Love is a huge asset to this team against 28 NBA teams, but he makes the Cavs match up horribly with the Warriors, especially when Kyrie is in.|Cavaliers|1

The K Love jokes are fucking old and he's obviously a net positive to the Cavs...\n\nReading this thread, I'm convinced that none of you are original.\n\nThe reason they won is cause a) it's a home game...finally and b) LeBron was excellent. The best in the world. Curry can make everything, including shots out of his ass (yes I know he makes shit like that), and even so he's still not as good as LeBron when he plays like this.|Lakers|10
Defense and effort were the reason we won. And while Love is a quality player, we don't know if he can actually contribute against the Warriors (it's a bad matchup). Jefferson good defense and allowed us to switch, which is what we can't do with Love. |[CLE] LeBron James|4

I am so proud of this team. After all the shit every single player got from the media/fans in the last week, that was a hell of a bounce back. Kyrie had so much swagger out there, it looked like once he got it going early, he knew he was back. JR was money tonight, that's the JR I remember. Clutch from downtown and showed so much heart on defense. LeBron struggled with turnovers again, luckily he was a beast in every other aspect. Amazing leadership. RJ was such an amazing pickup for this team. He plays with so much grit and passion, and is still extremely talented for his age. Shout out to all the people on this sub that talked about how trash TT is after Game 2. 14 pts 13 rebs, what a performance. 5 yrs/82 mil doesn't look bad at all when he plays like that. \n\nOur offense looked so much more crisp tonight, people just played with so much more energy and confidence. \n\nOur defense was amazing tonight. Curry and Thompson were completely swarmed. The close outs on everyone else seemed much less lethargic. People were fighting for every loose ball, through every screen, just playing with so much more heart.|Cavaliers|78

Ladies and gentlemen, The Finals have started |Lakers|4
Fuck man, I came into this game rooting for the Cavs cause I want a good series, but quickly started rooting for the Warriors. I just want to watch one close game these finals.\n\nThat being said it was really impressive to watch the Cavs play the way they did and keep themselves in this series. People were so obnoxious in the game thread saying it was all because Love wasn't on the floor though. This team played lights out. Their physicality on defense was huge yeah, but they were just so wet I really don't think Love's lack of defense or whatever would have mattered. Kyrie has been shit on just as much if not more but the way he shot tonight made that irrelevant. I mean shit, I don't think anyone but the starters scored in the first half, maybe longer. So yeah, hopefully they can keep this up throughout the rest of the series. I seriously doubt the Warriors play like they did in the first half tonight for much more, if any, of the rest of the series.\n\nI'm hoping we can get this series to go 7 but I just don't know if the Cavs can continue what they did tonight. I think they had their backs up against the wall and because of that came out like rabid dogs. Dunno if that type of motivation will continue and if both teams regress back towards the mean at all I still see the dubs taking it in 6, maybe 5. |[DEN] Dikembe Mutombo|4
I don't think the Cavs can win four matches without a contribution from the bench... their stars made a huge effort that cannot really be sustained for that long. We'll see, because Curry and Klay are going to show up at some point!||5

"Both teams will play hard." - Ecallaw Deeshar|[LAC] DeAndre Jordan|1
Noob question: Is plus/minus a legit stat?\n\nBarnes had 3 times the points of Green (6 vs. 18) plus more rebounds and less turnovers, in roughly the same amount of minutes played. Yet, Barnes\' (+/-) is 9 points lower than Green. Does this typically "even out" over the course of the year, or does this give insight into defensive effort that is not typically quantified, or both?||5
Raw +/- is not a legit stat.  When it's used in advanced analytics, it's run through a series of regressions to mostly account for different lineups, so you can mostly isolate a player's performance.  \n\nAnd even in that situation, you need a huge sample size in order to make it reliable, which usually means multiple seasons worth of data.\n\nSo the way it's being used right now - only 3 games of data and not accounting for team or opponent lineups - is not legit at all.|Pistons|3

This was the version of the Cavaliers that made me nervous. |Warriors|4
Then G1/2 and I got comfortable and then complacent. Series almost on!|Warriors|1
I wasn't happy with the way the Warriors played today. There was absolutely no effort boxing out or going for the rebounds with both hands. This led to getting crushed on the boards, which does absolutely no favors, especially when the Cavaliers were shooting lights-out in three of four quarters. Also, Klay, Dray, and Steph began to do the tunnel vision thing when they were down and not hitting shots, which led to turnovers. So we start being down on FG%, rebounds, and turnovers. \n\nWe got ourselves stuck in corners, we either rushed the shot or got stuck with a low shot clock, and players were slow to get back even if they hadn't tried to get the rebound. It was super weird.|Warriors|5
Where is curry? 2nd year in a row he's struggling in the Finals. I'd give him a pass for the first 2 games but 3 games in a row? Inexcusable. Where's the guy who scored 17pts in OT? He only scored 2pts in the 1st half? Credit to Cavs D I'm sure but come on...|Lakers|5

My buddy got terrible seats after game 2, and they were $215. That's as cheap as it got, but it was the best money he's ever spent.||1
Were they standing rooms or just all the way up top-seats? The United Center as standing rooms that are cheap. But if I have to *stand* forget it, I'll just go to the bar and watch it with some friends.\n\nI'd spend $215 on seats that are up at the top but not standing room. $215 is cheap for a finals game if you get an actual seat for it.|Lakers|1
It was an actual seat up at the top, but I don't think anyone was sitting.||1
Ah then he got a **great** deal for those tickets. \n\nHad a buddy spend 300+ on standing room tickets for a Bulls-Heat playoff game (when LBJ was still there). He said it got so crowded he had to stand in the back and ended up watching it on a monitor.|Lakers|1
Got three tickets before game one, so they were more expensive too. After taxes and fees with flash seats they were 1650 a ticket. Mid court, club seats on the second floor. Worth it when we win ;) |Cavaliers|2

Can someone tell me why Shump looks like he told his barber to JUST||5
Even if the Warriors win, I don't know if you can call this team better than the 96 Bulls. The Bulls lost 3 games in the entire playoffs, with score differences of 3, 21, 11. The Warriors have had a few really terrible games this postseason. |Bulls|6
Yeah, pretty clear the Bulls were better. GS still top 3 tho, which is insane||1
We got LeBroned so fuckin hard.|Warriors|2
Warriors threw the game so they can win the championship at home in 5. ||4

What is wrong with this sub it's acting crazy buggy |[CHA] Kemba Walker|2
Massive defensive improvement from the Cavs, but the Warriors missed a lot of shots you'd expect them to make|Kings|2
**1)** Cavs starters need some bench help\n\n**2)** Love should be 6th man this series\n\n**3)** JVG was funny with the hell-freezing-over-before-Draymond-gets-that-last-flagrant-or-last-two-techs-comment\n\n**4)** Steph shouldn't be in MJ or Lebron talks (if that's his trajectory) if he can't step up in the Finals.  Someone might argue that he doesn't need to but....that's not what's happening here.\n\n**5)** Harry kind of dominated Channing Frye in that matchup\n\n**6)** J.R. was good...very good.\n\n**7)** Richard Jefferson can dunk (JK, he'd get mad at that comment based on his Snapchat...which I love)\n\n**8)** Lebron 1 AST away from a Lebron\n\n**9)** I wish Harrison Barnes was on the Bulls\n\n**10)** Iman Shumpert is as good as his hair (not good)\n\n**11)** That game was a murder|Bulls|2

Love needs to go ahead and get another concussion, also lebron shooting jumpers again is a good sign. |[DAL] Dirk Nowitzki|2
LeBron going to make sure Love stays concussed |Warriors|2
Dont call it a comeback!|Suns|2
Surprised at how good the role players were tonight. Thompson with 10 points and 13 rebounds and 5/6 fg. Jefferson too, great game|San Diego Clippers|2
Give us a 7 game series King James!|Raptors|2
Now that's the J.R Smith that gives me that sense of dread watching.|Warriors|2
Do you guys love should start next game? Assuming he will be cleared to play? Or would you go with the same team to carry the momentum carried with this win. ||2
LeBron was 1 assist off from a LeBron (27/7/7), I feel like he's always off by 1 stat. \n\nStill, he absolutely dominated tonight. He was aggressive from start to finish. He couldn't finish well in the 2nd quarter but he didn't let that stop him from shooting, they need him to do that.|Raptors|2
so happy....not getting swept!  we have a chance!  & it's my birthday... thanks for showing up cavs...& thanks for that concussion blow, barnes. best bday present.|Cavaliers|2

Holy fuck this sub went to shit so fast. Some dude actually asked if Curry should get a ring if GSW wins. Thank god for mods.  \n\n|Lakers|2
He hasnt played very well. Definitely not MVP caliber. That bogus play when he hooked LeBrons arm on the way down the floor and flopped is everything thats wrong with the game of basketball. Despicable. If LeBron had a game like that or pulled that shit he'd be crucified.\n\n\nThat being said. He has a huge part in getting the Warriors there, super deserving of a ring.\n|Suns|4

did the guy who said Frye would get 15 points tonight eat his shirt yet?|Timberwolves|2
Better than the 01 lakers though|Lakers|2
Curry and Klay needs to wake the fuck up if they want to win this series. You can't rely on your bench to win you 4 games in a playoffs series. Bench won Game 1, Dray won Game 2. Time for the Splash Bros. to get GSW the 3rd and 4th wins in this series.\n\n\n\nOh, and Lebron looked angry and motivated tonight like a 2012-2013 Lebron. \n\n||2
Today's performance was vintage James also the help around him. Came up big with the likes of Jefferson and Thompson. Helping the defence was incredible! special mention goes to JR smith. PS: Wish THAT half court shot counted! :)||2
I expect Bogut to play less than 10 minues next game. ||2
Welp. Warriors got thumped. Not much else to say. Even during the stretches when their offense looked *okay* the Cavs offense just looked better and defensively the Warriors were pretty much a step behind all night. \n\nCertainly makes it a more interesting series. I still think the Warriors win it, but they certainly didn't put together a convincing argument tonight. Curry's gotta get going soon though. The scrutiny train has left the LBJ platform and is barreling its way to Wardell's place if he can't put together an MVP performance soon, then we'll definitely have a series on our hands. ||2
Bring love in off the bench, it's gotta be done|Pacers|2
'GOAT' teams cant be considered that if they are blown the fuck out so many times|Lakers|2
Honestly, just hoping for close games... These blowouts from either side just aren't satisfying.||2
This playoffs can be summarized, with the exception of gs and OKC, by one team coming to play and the other coming to collect checks. ||2
My favourite part of the home crowd so much.||2
On some folks suggestion I'll post an amended and updated version in the cavs. never did it on the heat. that's interesting..||2
Hahahahahahaha see r/nba? This series ain't over. ||2
Cavs bench need to step up. |Clippers|2
Don't even bother playing Kevin love. He sucks.|Rockets|2
I don't understand what's with all the kevin love hate? He clearly isn't good vs the Warriors match-up. But not all teams are like the Warriors, they are definitely 1 of a kind. He was still a huge factor in the East Playoffs, spacing the floor, hitting open shots while helping the team cruise in the EC. I'd say he can come off the bench on Friday and help the team when the death lineup is resting. Cavs fans should not give up on the big fella easily and should give him credit where credit is due. SMH|Cavaliers|2
Lebron with 232 points...mama there goes that man|Heat|2
Holy shit. My mom came into my room to bring me a plate of chicken nuggets and I literally screamed at her and hit the plate of chicken nuggets out of her hand. She started yelling and swearing at me and I slammed the door on her. I'm so distressed right now I don't know what to do. I didn't mean to do that to my mom but I'm literally in shock from the results tonight. I feel like I'm going to explode. Why the fucking fuck are they losing? This can't be happening. I'm having a fucking breakdown. I don't want to believe the world is so corrupt. I want a future to believe in. I want the Dubs to go back to back. I cannot fucking deal with this right now. It wasn't supposed to be like this, I thought they were supposed to sweep??? This is so fucked.|Spurs|10

I\'ve always said, most respect in the land goes to you all, raptors fans. The standing ovation that team got at home the game they lost the series made me tear up.

People are so damn reactionary. OKC series, this series in multiple ways, etc. Its like nobodies watched basketball before. Youre kinda expected to win at home. Doing so in a dominant fashion like GSW helps give credence to them winning the series but why is anyone surprised by a dominant game 3 performance by the cavs. It happens all the time after a solid first two games by the home team. We wont really get an idea how this series will go until after the next game where we see if GSW can respond or the Cavs keep the pedal down. |Bulls|2
Yeah but can you remember a series that's been as bipolar as this finals and the conference finals have been?\n\nI know we've seen occasionally huge blowouts, like the Heat in 2012, but it seems like this playoffs have been 90% blowouts and that's abnormal.  |Pistons|2
True its definitely an odd series. |Bulls|1
i agree with you..particularly about the next game. but honestly dude, those first 2 blowouts had lots of cavs fans terrified & demoralized. not surprised cavs won, but surprised they were so dominant tonight.|Cavaliers|3
It's actually a bit disappointing to me that the Cavs intensity and effort in this game was so much higher than in games 1 and 2. \n\nI mean, its the Finals....every game should be do or die, not just when you're 2 games down and playing in front of your home crowd. |Pacers|2
I mean, same goes for the Warriors too.\n\nBut as Central div bros, yeah, fuck the Cavs. o/|Pistons|1

Cavs showing Warriors no love.||3
This has to take some sheen off Curry's season and general aura right? I mean, Klay did his part but Curry has not been able to shake off that rust or attach to the hip defense on him and more so he seemed to be rattled by it too. Three games in a row without his signature bursts is not what we expect.||2

Lebron with a 32/11/6 and shooting over 50%, with his teams back against the wall and missing one of their big guns. You knew he'd be a monster tonight but that is still an incredible stat line in a must win situation|Supersonics|1

4 GAME WIN STREAK INCOMING|Bulls|1
What a turnaround! Also lebron blocking curry after the whistle|[CLE] LeBron James|1
My college housing app was due today, oh well, hot take time instead.\n\n\nThe takes:\n\n\nHigh pnr with Tristan Thompson and Kyrie is the most effective move, especially since Tristan can dribble drive and hit free throws\n\nNeed to see more confidence from JR, but he is really much more of a team player than he\'s ever been -- he definetly laid pipe earlier\n\n\nDraymond, despite how much I diss him, is the best Warrior rn, and it\'s hard to match up wit him if we\'re playing LeBron as the Free safety on D\n\n\nHmm maybe K Love on the bloc? Mozzy played with all the heart you need. I\'ve talked a lot about my faith in Lue, especially with those high PnRs with Thompson and Kyrie, but a huge part of his gameplan is Love getting touches and making shots. It will be very interesting to see how things go, especially since I\'m very sure it was really Love, not LeBron, behind the Blatt thing.\n\n\nHoly shit Kyrie is as good offensively as anyone, especially when he hits fuck you I\'m kyrie...ok shit kryie is so underrated after this last week from /r/nba\n\nRefs are always suss, but after looking over the calls they were mostly fair. But honestly, the Q is as good as Oracle for crowd noise and that\'s a big part of reffing\n\nMo Buckets is so criminally underrated. He gets buckets, and would start for an average NBA team\n\n\nKlay absolutely caught dick from Mozzy\n\n\nThe knicks would improve if they became a primarily ghostbusting group -- As would the Spurs, surprisingly. Also Kobe nearly was decapitated by the helicopter.\n\n\nShump had his best game of the playoffs, but sucks on O. Livingstone did not. \n\n\nQuick aside, thoughts on increasing the points to 3 and 4 point shots vs. 2 and 3 point shots? Basically it makes the 3 point shot less valuable --  instead of having three inside shots equalling two outside, three inside would now be 1 point greater. I dunno, I think it would be interesting -- some Grantland writers are fans of it and so am I.\n\n\nLMAO at Green kicking the ball -- he\'s a smart BBall player though, and I\'m sure people will love his cheek in ten to twenty years.\n\n\nBarnes is really underrated -- he\'s a starter on a CONTENDING team who can be a good two way player and if Al Farouq Aminu is still in "demand", well Barnes should get a max.\n\nI really hope Delly has a big dick if he\'s going to stand over Dray like that.\n\n\nTristan Thompson won this game, and is worth a max, mostly because he\'s so much better than the next available guy. I also believe Dennis Rodman is the GOAT and that Offensive Rebounds/2nd chance points is the greatest play in basketball.\n\n\nThe Warriors don\'t win because of three point shooting -- they win because they\'re historically great at hustling down the court and getting points in transition and force a tempo that other teams can\'t keep up with.\n\n\nThe Andre Iguodala Double Dribble Call is fair because of section 2.c of the NBA rules, "c. A player may not dribble a second time after he has voluntarily ended his first dribble.". On the other hand, the ball may not have been voluntarily turned over, but the dribble clearly ended.\n\nDory > Sea Turtle, so go Cavs!!\n\nPeople either say Curry is a good or bad defender -- I think he\'s a smart guy. Physically, he\'s not elite, and he won\'t forcxe turnovers with super twitchy play or blanketing arms, but he\'s very smart about the game and has a high BB IQ -- his steal total is legit and it\'s consistent too -- he was leading in steals even when monta ellis was in Oakland\n\n\n\nHmm, in response to the halftime shot, people talk a lot about the Warrior\'s range even while being contested, but I wonder what a team with JR, Nick Young, Javale McGee and Kobe would\'ve been like.|[CLE] Mark Price|1

Gotta hand it to Lue in this one. Decides to start RJeff, sits Delly for most of the game, and gave Frye a bit more PT. Cavs came out playing very physical from the get go. Sometimes its just comes down to making your shots, and the Cavs were finally hitting them.|Generals|1

Cavs with strong rotations this game, not running to the ball like pre-K soccer squad was huge. Coming up with steals that fuel the offense, also huge. Kyrie hitting net <- easily the biggest difference imo. This dude needs to be scoring. Going at Steph with the same tenacity the dubs have been going at kyrie and love, also huge. \n\nInteresting game. I had dubs in 6 and I'll sit on it for now. ||1
What's this sub gonna trash curry about when the dubs win the series 4-1?||1

What a blowout. OKC vs CLE would've been a better finals. Kappa. |Raptors|1
We can all agree Love must not  play anymore lmao|Thunder|1
He should play off the bench to provide some bench production. They lacked that tonight. And you dictate his minutes based on how his offense is going. ||1
No way Love starts again. You have to run that starting 5 back. |Wizards|1
gotta love this reactionary ass sub\n\nlol series over guise. got downvoted so much for saying cavs were still in this series|Bucks|1
I still think they'll lose. They need to do this again in game 4 or they are fucked imo.||1
Up 2-1 and the Dubs are already finished! Cavs 2016 champs.|Lakers|1
The prophecy will be fulfilled. Lebron will win a ring for Cleveland. ||1

I don't know about anyone else but as a casual fan of the NBA these three games have been boring as hell. Unless your a fan of either of these teams why would you wan't to watch a series with an average margin of victory of 26. There's no tension in these games. And the only excitement is in the  occasional great basketball play which is deemed pretty meaningless in the context of a 17 point lead. |NBA|1
I knew the Warriors wouldn't sweep, but I expected a better performance than this. Credit to the Cavs for locking down on defense, lots of steals and interrupting plays. Warriors never looked comfortable out there.|Warriors|1
Kevin Love on suicide watch. |Bulls|1
Everybody was saying Kyrie was so bad now that he was playing a strong offensive team. He definitely showed up today, the whole team did.|Bulls|1
No one beats a Lebron-led teams 8 times in a row.|Lakers|1

So is Golden State like Valve or something, totally afraid of the number 3? \n\nIt's bizarre how they've lost every Game 3 in this year's playoffs, though I guess it's due to playing away (which I never thought really mattered much until now).|[GSW] Andre Iguodala|1
How can they be scares of the number 3 when they depend on the 3 ball|[SAS] Tim Duncan|2

So much for LeDecline. Nice to see him hitting jumpers out there.|Lakers|1
game "warriors suck" 3\n\ncavs were great as well, gonna be a good series.|Bulls|1
At this point I'm convinced that if the Warriors were to face a high school team in a seven game series, they would still somehow lose game 3. It's basically tradition now|[NYK] J.R. Smith|1
If anyone was wondering who we were trading this offseason. Ya. Sucks but ya.|Cavaliers|1
anyone know the specific shoe lebron james was wearing tonight?||1
LeBron 13 Elite. Not sure if it's a PE edition or if it's a public release but the all black with the translucent sole looks nice. I don't really follow the LeBron line as the shoe is meant for the 3, 4, and 5 position and I play the 1 or 2 position and I need shoes specifically for that (Kobes, Lillards, Jordan XXXs, etc.).\n\nEdit: Sorry, I thought they were LeBron 13 Elites but they're actually a new shoe called Nike Soldier 10s. Looks real good.||2
thanks, appreciated!||1
I made a mistake, LeBron debuted a new shoe and they're called the Nike Soldier 10s. It should be a good shoe overall and can be used by all positions.||1
Yeah, def looks like the Soldier 10s that came out yesterday. Looks clean!||1
Klay calling the Mozgov collision"dirty"? \n\nWhat do you think?|Heat|1
Would it still be an exciting series if it went 7 games but all of them were blowouts?|Knicks|1
as a cavs fan, yes.|Cavaliers|2
Even if you lost ultimately? |Knicks|1

Soooooo. What do I do with this broom? Oh well, great game by the Cavs. Insane they had to wait for the 4th qtr to get bench points. ||1
What is dead may never die.|Cavaliers|1
Soooo K-Love is coming off the bench for the rest of the series right?????|Bucks|1
Has there ever been a playoffs with a higher average margin of victory per game? So many of these series have been two teams trading blowouts. |East|1
yes recently 2014 finals spurs heat, 4/5 out of games Spurs won via large margin|Lakers|1

Brewer and KJ are trash. If you want to trade Love for athletic wings go after talented ones. Maybe Middleton/Ariza or literally any other wings besides two of the Rockets worst bench players, on one of the worst benches in the NBA this year. ||6
[deleted]||1
Ya I agree. The sum is less than the parts. I think LeBron thought a 3pt shooting big would compliment him well, but he needs a more defensive big. I kind of hope he gets traded because he is too good to be used in his current role. I just wonder what players you could get for him. ||2
The more pro sports I watch, the more fixed it looks, and looks like it's becoming. Might as well watch wwe if they're gonna do this shit.||-5
They rig them to be blowouts. Fans love them |Bulls|2
Cause it's a miracle. Cleveland's weak offense suddenly drops 120 against gs suddenly skep #1 ranked defense on the same night ticket prices and ratings take a dramatic hit||-5
Cleveland has had a really good offense, and have two of the best offensive players in the league.\n\nMaybe, Home Crowd, Shots dropping, gameplan adjustments, have an effect.\n\nmaybe.|Cavaliers|5
It's the adrenaline of the crowd. Yeah, that must be it right? It's not the exact same 94 x 50 with 10' rims throughout the league. There's a difference where they play.||-2
Role players play better at home.\n\nBut yeah, sometimes shots dont fall, sometimes they do, this game they did.\n\nYou completely ignored "Gameplan Adjustments" though.|Cavaliers|3
Gameplan adjustment of 60 points||1
Yup.|Cavaliers|1

And Cavs took great shots in games 1 and 2. They missed a bajillion layups. And they also did tonight. They just made their 3s more. ||2
Everyone saying KLove not playing was the reason the Cavs won.  I have news for you.  Kyrie had the worst defense on the court by a LONG shot the past 2 games.  KLove is going to come out with a refined confidence after seeing his team man handle the MVP and his fellow Trash Bro. I agree he should play less minutes, but there is simply no reason for RJ to start over him.  You go with the tried and true leaders of your team, and KLove is one of them.|Cavaliers|-1
Well, the defense issue still remains with both of them together.  They're one of the absolute worst PnR defensive tandems in the league, so I think Lue should be careful with how he plays them.\n\nI agree Kyrie's D was worse, but you can usually hide 1 bad defender.  2 and it becomes rough.  Lue can use Love's concussion as an excuse to bring him off the bench when Kyrie sits, and then play it from ear from there.|Pistons|0
KLove has actually played solid defense in these finals.  Look at the Warriors' FG % against him.  He has played solid (not great) defense.  They're shooting 40% against Klove.  That is 100% worth it when Klove produces when he typically does.|Cavaliers|0
I once read this here:\n\n"Man, how much it means sh***ng in you own toilet"||-1

If the Cavs were to offer klove for Millsap would Atlanta take that?|Rockets|-1
Cavs with Milsap would win the ring automatically. ||2
No freaking way.  Millsap probably has equivalent offensive game, and is a top 10 defensive player in the league.\n\nI agree Lebron + Millsap would be sexy though.|Pistons|3
