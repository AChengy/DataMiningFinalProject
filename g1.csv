When LeBron sits the Cavs offense has to do better than a Kyrie fadeaway, they're getting taken to school by Livingston and Co.|Heat|1265
I would just let LeBron go iso for 48 minutes a game and tell him to shoot with 3 seconds on the shot clock. If this is the best effort the rest of the team has then they're fucked.|Kings|2
Lebron and his big 3 can't win against another team's bench. Pathetic showing from him and the cavs |Kings|5
from the ~10 cavs games i've watched, nothing seems comes easy to kyrie (when he's trying to create his own offense). it seems like every layup is either a double clutch, reverse, etc. or preceded by some crazy move. takes a lot of fadeaways, seems to be on the verge of losing his dribble a lot. He did get to the FT line a lot today though. \n\n\n\n||5

3 points game with Bron, Iguodala's big three and then like blowout|Celtics|168
Yep. No clue what Lue was doing leaving LeBron on the bench to start the 4th - Cavs were getting slaughtered.|[OKC] Russell Westbrook|0
They wanted him to finish the game off strong not expecting their bench to completely get blown out before he could get back on.||8
Lebron still logged 41 minutes and he was getting worked by Iggy on D. He was probably gassed |Warriors|12
Summed up very eloquently.  |Spurs|1
wut?|Heat|39
It was a 3 point game with 30 seconds left in the 3rd. Lebron sits out literally until 10 minutes in the 4th quarter (only 2.5 minutes) and it becomes a 14 point blowout with a bunch of momentum for the Warriors.||112
Exactly that hit in the nuts was the turning point all the bench had to do was keep up and not let momentum build. As soon as lebron checked back in he probably was going to start doing the 4th quarter lebron thing where he just keeps going to the rim building a lead, cavs loosen up and start hitting shots.\n\nComing back in down 10 or whatever was not what he had in mind and he had to play cautiously to keep it close but the cavs as a whole couldn't execute because they locked up. |Pelicans|10
He also continued to get stripped, and he missed some shots inside.\n\nIt's really crazy how different his game is now that the Monstars jacked his jumpshot. I feel like he used to be more terrifying in Miami, even playing from behind, because sometimes he'd just bring the ball up and then nail a few threes before smashing his way inside again. |Spurs|3
Two of his turnovers were great strips by all-NBA level defenders, and the other time he lost it in the 4th (I haven't seen a replay, so I could be wrong here) looked like he lost his footing and slipped a bit.\n\n3 or 4 of his misses were attempted tip-ins with 3 people around him. Take those out and he's over 50%. \n\n>because sometimes he'd just bring the ball up and then nail a few threes before smashing his way inside again.\n\nHe literally just did that in this game.|Hawks|3
Did I say they were careless TOs? Or that he whiffed open layups? The guy I responded to was saying that he felt like there was a difference between how Lebron would've played in a close game versus how he did play with the Cavs down 10. I'm saying that Lebron *was* driving in, but that it didn't work out that well, for whatever reason.\n\nYes, he hit two threes. One early in the third (followed by a missed 3) and one late in the 4th when the game was out of reach. But he used to be a threat to do that constantly. Or to drive halfway, stop short on his defender, and hit a 15-footer. That seems to have all but disappeared. \n\n|Spurs|1
Umm... Well I mean he's never really had a great pull up shot and that's not really his bread and butter. He kinda did the whole I'm going to start pulling up and make shots in the 3rd and it brought Cleveland close.\n\nHe just has to play alot differently when cavs are down by so much and can't get a stop defensively and not a single role player can step up. He got stripped twice, but that's because some of the warriors were cheating off their man really well.  |Pelicans|2
There was also a point midway through the 3rd when it was like 71-68, kyrie sits, the cavs throw away a few possessions in a row, then delly hits Iggy in the globes...right before that you could feel the cavs getting close to controlling the tempo. Bottom line delly & co got torched. Also fuck JR smith||3
both delly and jr smth were worse than useless on both ends.||3

They ran  two plays that didn't involve Lebron tonight.\n\n1. Kyrie fade-away\n\n2. Love in the post missing a lay-up\n\nNot really seeing how this is an improvement from Blatt.|Rockets|386
It's fine because the team has never been closer and that's all that matters.|Celtics|1
Yeah, it sucks LeBron couldn't take Spoelstra with him to Cleveland lol |Thunder Bandwagon|3
Spoelstra wasn't that good either Lebron just had Allen Wade and Bosh on his team rather then 2 points JR smith and the man that used to be Kevin Love||-4
Would you really not put Spoelstra in the top 7 or so head coaches? |Thunder Bandwagon|1
Absolutely not, I feel like you're underrating Dwyane Wade if anything.\n\nThe real question is if Spo had anything to do with Whiteside's ascension and I'm inclined to say no, because that sort of improvement really has to come from within.|Bulls|1
I don't know who I want to lose this series more. Green or Lebron for that Blatt firing.|Nuggets|2
He looks lost out there, honestly. ||10
Lue had never coached a team in his life. Blatt was a rookie to the NBA not coaching, he'd been coaching and won titles elsewhere. |Mavericks|31
/r/nba has flipped the script completely. |Raptors|33
Eh I mean I always saw comments in the threads about Lue reminding everyone that Blatt got the team to the finals last year and seemed to coach well with the depleted roster. I think people did a good job of reserving judgment until post-Finals. |Bulls|14
Just after the Raptors series, people were singing praises on Lue for getting the team together in a way Blatt didn't. Statistically, the teams have been pretty similar except that Lue had a healthy roster this year for the playoffs, whereas Blatt just had one for the first round where they did sweep the Celtics.|Raptors|3
I mean, Tyronn sounds confident in press conferences so he must be a tactical coach.|76ers|11
He drops the F bomb a lot so he must know what he's doing. |Hawks|3
Hes there for the boys in the locker rooms and to take the blame. We all know Lebron is the coach|Celtics|13
How many coaches is that guy going to eat up? It'll be like 2 a year at this rate||3
spolstra survived, and went on to prove he's actually a pretty decent coach.|Mavericks|6
He survived because Riley gave him authority. Blatt is a good coach too, Gilbert just let Lebron run the team and fuck over the coach|Celtics|2
LeBron played himself with that Blatt firing. |[TOR] DeMar DeRozan|14
They need Anthony Bennet back|Thunder|631
He's available...|Raptors|2
They need Dion Waiters back\n\nFTFY|Warriors|20
Nah Dion's actually not half bad|Warriors|7
I was actually pretty impressed with his play in the WCF, and hope he can keep on improving. But I also know he was rather prone to boneheaded plays when he was with the Cavs.|Warriors|4
[He still is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziG2rEwu9cI)||1
He still is now, they are just becoming less frequent.|Thunder|4
Zach Lowe was right. Holy hell are the Cavs prone to backdoor cuts.|Knicks|1784
[deleted]||25
Livingston consistently hits those mid range twos over shorter guards.  Maybe not consistently 80%, but that is his shot and he's nearly automatic at it.  |Warriors|0
Ah yes, here comes the luck narrative!||0
I thought Cleveland has the right idea. Limit curry and klay and warriors bench needed career highs to win the game. |Warriors|0
Well one of those won't go away. |Lakers|1
But they were stupidly wide open shots. How many times does Livingston have to dribble one step passed the free throw line and take an uncontested jump shot before someone decides to defend him? He's going to hit those all series if that's your plan.|Timberwolves|1
Dude they had open space for days. Ya their benched played amazing, but their starters didn't?  Equalizer.|Lakers|1
Nah, I counted Love, Kyrie, and Bron missing 8 wide open lay-ups between them alone. \n\nThe real problem though is how dependent the Cavs are on LeBron. He checked out with 34 seconds left in the 3rd down 3. Came back with ~9:40 left in the 4th. Balloons to a 13 point lead.|Raptors|1
I mean, you can't really do anything about that. Guys will get hot and play beyond expectations. But you cut down on the backdoor cuts, and this could've been a game.|Warriors|1
It wasn't your only problem, but it was certainly a problem.||1
Cavs were leaving the lane wide open all night. Livingston was on fire hitting those shots at the top of the key. |76ers|2
To be fair, that's exactly Livingston's game. Warriors couldn't get the three to fall, so might as well settle for our mid-range ace ||2
THIS. 8-10 from Livingston and 5-5 from Barb? not to mention Bogut 5-7? These are the guys you let shoot so curry doesn't shoot. Doubt itll happen again.|Heat|23
Doubt curry and klay have any more games nearly this bad either. It will even out. ||1
Yeah it should still now game 2 is a must win for cavs. They have to walk out of the oracle with 1 game at least and i think they will, the big 3 were clicking today for sparks especially kevin love and lebron. Lue and Lebron better give kyrie a talk about those iso plays man move the ball and tell JR to shoot the ball the man barely touched the ball today.|Heat|2
Doubt Curry and Klay combine for 20 points on 8/27 again either.|Rockets|1
Yeh and I doubt Curry and Thompson only get 20 points total between them. So that was what 41 points between the 3 players you mention which probably won't happen again but it's not like Curry and Thompson couldn't make up for 21 point difference between the two of them. That is also saying Livingston Barb and Bogut go scoreless. My point is while the bench will obviously score less next time Curry and Thompson will score more. That is a mighty hill to climb for the Cavs especially after losing by 15 tonight after the Warriors took their foot off the gas.|[MIA] Alonzo Mourning|1
It doesn't need to happen again. But the way kyrie was defending out there tonight, I wouldn't be surprised if Livingston plays well all series |Spurs|1
Yeah but both Curry and Klay being this cold probably won't happen again either.|Celtics|1
You are right, but I also doubt that Klay and Steph will be so quiet again. |Warriors|1
>These are the guys you let shoot so curry doesn't shoot. Doubt itll happen again.\n\nBut that's the whole point: Cleveland focused their defense on making sure Steph and Klay didn't beat them, but in doing so they sacrificed playing good defense on anyone else. They were highlighting that on the replay in the 4th quarter when it showed how they were double and triple teaming Steph off the ball and in doing so were giving up dunks and wide open threes. \n\nGS just showed that there is a very real penalty to pay for tilting the whole defense towards just two guys, cause everyone else over there is more than capable of making you pay if you leave them open and unguarded. But if the Cavs instead start respecting everyone on the Warriors so the role players don't burn them again, then it's not unreasonable to expect Steph and Klay to have 30-40 point games. ||2
Doubt Curry and Thompson will be this cold. Double edged sword||2
Well I mean Bogut shot .627 on the year. He doesn't score much but he doesn't miss very often because they're so easy.|Warriors|3
Did you not watch Livingston dominate the Portland series?|Warriors|4
Probably, but how many games are you going to get when both Klay and Steph shoot this poorly?|Mavericks|4
I doubt curry and Klay will play this poorly again in the series |Warriors|5
Still would rather have splash bros play well than the rest of team shoot 85%.|Wizards|2
Livingston will hit the elbow jumper all series of the cavs let him. Those Bogut hooks and Barbose floaters are fools gold tho|[WAS] John Wall|8
Doubt the splash brothers will score 20 points total for a game again.|Bulls|182
Doubt the cavs will shoot below 40% again...|Pistons|-17
as long as Kyrie keeps dribbling that's a safe bet|Timberwolves|6
actually i'll take you up on that bet|Warriors|39
It wasn't the threes that surprised me. It was the missed bunnies. |Lakers|3
They were straight up missing consecutive wide open looks. It was insane. I felt so uncomfortable with even that original 14 point lead because they just weren't on. But the bench just completely outplayed the Cavs as a whole today which was amazing to watch. |Pistons|11
Delly jumping kin front of Livingston is not a contested shot|Warriors|6
So, like, the Warriors in the regular season?|Warriors|271
sure but this isnt the regular sesason, so its better to predict whats going to happen based off how your team has played in the postseason. so barbosa and livingston probably wont do this gain.|Suns|0
>so barbosa and livingston probably wont do this gain.\n\nMaybe not, but it's certainly not unrealistic to think that Livingston, Barbosa, Steph and Klay will combine for 51 points again. After all, that's all those 4 had tonight as a combined total. \n||1
I mean, Basrbosa and Livingston have been doing it for 2 NBA seasons, including a championship run last year...both, but especially Livingston have been cold of late, but they're getting back to their standard performance now....it's just not great news for Cavs fans|Warriors|3
I thought Livingston played well in the Blazers series and the tail end of the OKC series|Warriors|1
Ya, but he's been pretty ice cold since then. The whole year he's been $ in the bank on turn-around mid-rangers, but was ice cold in the Thunder series. \n\nHe's not going to take over games from here on out, but hopefully he can be Mr. Reliable with his mid-range again.|Warriors|1
he hasn't really had the opportunity to use his deadly midrange because of OKC's length|Warriors|3
That's actually a good point. OKC's length could have...errrrrr DID really put him at a disadvantage....but now the W's have the advantage again with him. \n\nI like it.|Warriors|2
I'm way more surprised by Barbosa than Livingston. SDot is amazing from mid range, and he has the size to shoot over the guards defending him. |[GSW] Stephen Curry|9

Lol come up with another excuse man. Lue had no other options, the dubs just have a better bench. And starters. ||23
Livingston just feasts on small guards. And it's not like Cavs guards are capable of generating much defense. I'm not at all surprised Livingston went off (didn't he have a huge game on Christmas vs the Cavs?) - but 100% surprised Curry and Klay didn't.|Trust The Process|8
Seriously. While Steph and Klay usually play much better, I'm not surprised at all at how well Livingston played. He's a fucking stud, and would drop 20 ppg if he played 30+ mpg.|Warriors|12
Livingston is from my home town so I've followed and rooted for him his whole career. With all the unlucky shit that he's been through during his career; his ending up on this team feels like sweet sweet justice! The basketball gods can be generous when the mood strikes them.||3
Indeed. I love Shaun Livingston. He's played the backup PG so well the past 2 years. I'm so glad to see him perform at the level we know he can; and in The Finals no less!|Warriors|3
It doesn't help that they seem to always send doubles at the worst moments.|Celtics|4
he also said in regards to last year's Finals\n   \n>The Cavs do have other options who are tough on defense such as Iman Shumpert and Tristan Thompson, but that\xe2\x80\x99s besides the point. The point is that most of the outside world views the losses of players like Irving and Love as problematic, while those in the know do not. |Warriors|26
Uh, as a super casual fan, why was the loss of Love and Irving not problematic for Cavs?||1
Obvious to anyone who knows basketball. Irving and Love  one dimensional players who can't defend. Doesn't cut it versus a real team that plays as a team.||4
I've always said this. Cavs cannot win with Love on the floor, and Dellavedova played his heart out last year to make up for Kyrie being out.|Warriors|9
The fuck is wrong with Love anyway? Dude looks lost. What happened to the player from Minnesota?||10
He was the best option on a terrible team, but he was still the #1 option, so he got the ball a ton. Now he has to make the most of fewer opportunities.\n\nThere was a post on here a few months ago about how almost all of his scoring & playmaking in Minnesota came from the top of the arc & the elbows, not the corners. Cleveland puts him in the corners a lot because Kyrie & LeBron occupy the elbow & center court. That's not comfortable for him.\n\nThe league has also changed since his prime days in Minnesota. Post scoring is basically useless unless you are hyper-efficient/dominant and Kevin Love is more of a scrapper down low, which is not as useful as a skill as it used to be. Cleveland also doesn't want him clogging the paint as a post-up big.\n\nFinally, he's never been healthy, so it's not far-fetched to think that one of his injuries was a bad one that hampered his athleticism or confidence.|Warriors|19
The Warriors are also just better. imo.|Jazz|242

[deleted]||2
I know, I meant objective. As in, the IMO didn't need to be added. They're objectively the better team. |Raptors|2
They may well ultimately be, but the playoffs obviously involve a huge amount of adjustments and changes. Cleveland could address this in the next few games. |[POR] Luke Babbitt|3
Not to speak for u/rbmw263 but I think hes saying that you can't really adjust to a team being better than you. There are certainly tactical things you can do to try and compensate for a gap in talent but sometimes that greater talent will be the difference. |Pistons|2
Good thing that wasn't the case.|Cavaliers|1
I can get down with that. I'm just fresh off watching seven games of WCF hot takes with people writing off teams after a few losses. I think GSW is the better team but Cleveland could always make adjustments to compensate. I think the Thunder were actually the better team when matched up against GSW, but the Warriors made adjustments and made them pay. |[POR] Luke Babbitt|2

"Steph and Klay shooting for a combined record low....Warriors win by 15."|Warriors|2
I think the big 3 were hogging the ball. Smith should've gotten more touches. Dude can can get hot and no one can stop him when that happens||2
He has a mentally handicap basketball iq. Remember what he did last yr in crunch time. Hes a nobody and wont do anything these finals. Unless lebron scores 40 they wont win a game.||1
Out of 3 touches, he scored 3 points. I'm not saying let him make plays. I'm saying he should he given a chance to be hot one game. Jr hot one game plus the big 3 doing their thing means a win for cavs. Almost.||1
And what if curry and klay score there usuals. No chance cavs win||1
It's not really that absurd, the warriors are really good outside of steph and klay.|Thunder|2
I wasn't saying it was absurd at all, just a bit unexpected. \n\nIf I'd told you that those things were going to happen before the game, would you have guessed that GS would win by 15? Highly unlikely..|[DAL] Dirk Nowitzki|12

Yeah they were both off, i saw the game just having some fun at LeBron expense. Bigger issues once they get back on track ||1
According to my math, that still wouldn't have cut it.||1
Not to mention the fact that kyrie & love shot horribly. I know lebron was 9-21 but like 4 of his misses were just tips that went off the rim. \n\nPretty much, kyrie needs to shoot around 50 percent & lebron probably needs to get 20-25 *shots*, not 21 shots with 4 or so being missed tips. \n\nAlso, it wouldn't hurt for a guy like JR or Channing Frye to step up in game 2 either.. \n\nEdit: Not saying these things would guarantee the cavs a win, just might help, especially when curry & klay have a *regular* shooting night. |[NBA] Lebron James|9

Last finals TT, Mozgov, Delly and JR got the team 40 points per game. \n\nI know it's different, Mozgov's minutes go to Love and Frye now, but still, if they can defend the Warriors adequately, it doesn't seem crazy to expect the rest of the team to chip in 35 points or so. \n\nSpeaking of, why the hell didn't Mozgov play till garbage time? It's not like the Warriors are suddenly different now that they have Andy; Mozgov + TT was brutal for the Warriors last year, and it looks a lot like the strategy that almost put the Thunder over the top. |Spurs|4
Per Jalen Rose?||4
with the way their bench plays theyre going to need more than that|Lakers|237
Are you judging their bench purely off this game? If not, you should know it's a good bench. |Bulls|10
Ehh|Pistons|1
They have a good bench, the Warriors have a great bench|Bulls|6
i thought Frye was a big part of their bench but he only played 19 mins? \n\nThe other 3 are Delly (worse than Livingston), Jefferson (worse than Iggy), and Shumpert (exact opposite of Barbosa). \n\nI don't see how that bench can really make that big of a dent against a deep team like the W's||17

The crowd wasn't really in it either. Weird atmosphere at Oracle tonight. Or maybe I'm just used to Game 5 and 7 of Oracle last series. |Wizards|181
Lol dead silent crowd at half time show with G-Eazy. Awkward|Lakers|1
Game 1 and we were in control for most of the game. |[GSW] Tim Hardaway|1
The Cavs kept it close most of the game.  The crowd was rightfully nervous, even when encouraging the Warriors during the back and forth.  Cleveland erased a big lead. |Magic|1
Those were do or die situations though. |Raptors|1
Cavs slooowwweeeddd the pace down so much, even when there were runs, it was over 3-4 minutes, instead of the normal 30-40 seconds.|[GSW] Stephen Curry|1
I thought so too. When cavs got on that run in the 3rd it almost sounded like the crowd was complaining.||1
I really disagree. \n\nSource: My still-ringing ears and non-existent voice. |Warriors|2
Crowd was better than it sounded, ABC had a really good mic system which didn't pick up the crowd nearly as much so the announcers were better heard |Supersonics|3
No dagger emphatic 3's by Steph and Klay except in the last 2 minutes of the game|Knicks|3
Hmm, I have been to every Warrior playoff game, including this one, since the early 90's. The crowd didn't jump out at me as particularly bad tonight. Maybe it was the mics?|[GSW] Adonal Foyle|4
This is so wrong and this misinformation is not appreciated.  I was there (have season tix) and it was LOUD AS SHIT from the get go.  I was very proud of the crowd today.  Standing for majority of the time and my ears ringing and throat is sore from the yelling which seemed like it happened the entire game.  No clue where you got this info from or if tv mutes it, but it was wild in there.  OKC game 1 made me nervous that things had changed, but this was a pleasant reminder.|[GSW] Draymond Green|5
Nah, it definitely seemed really quiet, at least on TV|Warriors|16
Really? I heard the Warriors chant quite a bit.|Lakers|1
Yeah idk about that. According to the beat reporters the crowd was so loud the cavs couldn't communicate about the shot clock running down leading to the violations.|[LAL] Kobe Bryant|6
different crowd nowadays. have you seen the ticket prices? You don't get as many die hard as you do VIP schmoozers|[GSW] Mitch Richmond|392
> You don't get as many die hard as you do VIP schmoozers\n\nOracle was hyped yesterday, but people like this were also there. I was in the upper section and there was an Asian couple, probably in their 20s, and zero reaction all game, even left with 3 min to go. The woman at least had her free shirt on, the dude had no Warriors gear on. Those fans were incredibly lame.|Warriors|1
Yes because rich people can't be diehard fans.|Warriors|1
By Bay Area standards, tickets were actually incredibly cheap on the resell market for yesterday's game.|Warriors|1
I mean it's the same crowd as game 7 those tickets were just as expensive. So that doesn't make any sense. ||1
My friend went to the game. He said it was definitely one of the quietest game he's been to. Different crowd for sure |Warriors|1
Yea a lot of the crowd is rich old people lmao|Thunder|1
My buddy sold his two tickets for $1500 a piece (20 rows up)|[GSW] Chris Mullin|1
Bro, thats trademarked|Raptors|1
Agreed.  It's a group of rich people who only cheer when 3's are hit.  GSW fans from 1987-2015 would slap them in the mouth.|[GSW] Draymond Green|2
Seriously. The crowd seemed really dead for a finals game 1. these prices are driving the real local fans out.|Warriors|3
I was really unimpressed when I went to that Celts@GSW game. I think part of it was that the Celts were playing better than them but there were a lot of "how\'s this game work again?" people nearby, lotta newbies. And the CSN Authentic Fan placards are just embarrassing.|Celtics|2
Bunch of tech bandwagon nerds. Damn shame die hard, bay fans can't afford tickets||6
That's awfully true. I noticed instead of the rowdy, raucous crowd Oracle usually gets, there was more 'woos' and hand clapping tonight.|[ATL] Pete Maravich|5
$893 for two seats in 209 row 23 is a steal though! /s|Warriors|8
That's not bad, the cheapest I saw when I quickly scanned nbatickets.com was $550 each.|Warriors|1
Do you really expect to pay 150 bucks for a finals ticket? There are only two basketball teams left playing. Everyone wants to see them! I paid 350 for my ticket and thought it was a great deal. Seriously, 400 bucks for the defining series of the season is a great deal. |Warriors|2
Different crowd from last week? That gentrification really sneaks up on you!|Warriors|151
Considering the prices of the tickets during the finals a lot of season ticket holders are probably just selling them at massive profit instead of actually going.||1
The pricing of finals tickets vs conference finals can weed out a lot more "regular" fans. We\'ll probably see the same thing in Cleveland. ||10
Idk I thought they were pretty loud.  ESPN might mic the crowd differently than TNT|[GSW] Jason Richardson|239
Good thing, I couldn't hear shit except the crowd for most of the TNT series, especially at OKC.|Lakers|1
They were pretty loud on TSN (the Canadian broadcast) as well |Raptors|1
they definitely do. I'm sure each station has their own mic set up. You know how every spurs game on tnt has at least one annoying ass lady screaming her head off? The local station, fssw, never has a screaming lady on their audio.|Spurs|1
Pretty sure this is true. The PA announcer which I can usually hear quite well on TNT broadcasts I could hardly hear at all tonight.|Warriors|1
It was loud as shit.  I was there and it was as loud as its ever been, and moreso in that it was for majority of the game rather than just times when we needed it. |[GSW] Draymond Green|2
ehh...I've kinda felt this way for the past year. Def not as crazy as 07 'baron-town'|[GSW] Mitch Richmond|13
Well that tends to happen when the cheapest tickets are $500. |Warriors|30

Was there tonight, was also at Baron dunking on Kirlienko, that was the loudest I've ever heard it. Overall decent crowd tonight, not extremely loud but got in the game at the right times and stood most of the game, even lower level. Went to Game 1 last series and the crowds were equivalent imo (though the 4th quarter last series of game 1 was depressing).|[GSW] Calbert Cheaney|1
Cheapest tickets were $350 today\n\nCheck the Cleveland prices, it will be the same\n\nPeople are dumb if they think Oracle has quieted down after game 5 and 7 of last series. Shit was loud af |Kings|15
Everyone commenting doesn't know what the fuck they are talking about. National TV mics always mute the crowd. I paid 350 for my ticket a few hours before the game and the crowd was deafening. Fuck all these people that say the real fans are being priced out. Mother fucker I've been a fan for 25 years and it's the fucking finals. 350 for a finals ticket is a fucking steal. It's not like I got some incredible deal. I'm so sick of this narrative. I make 18 bucks an hour and live in SF, the most expensive city in the country. Guess what? I was at that game screaming my head off with plenty of real fans. \n\nSorry, I'm drunk but I'm sick of all these idiots saying the real fans can't afford the games. 18/hr in SF is damn near minimum wage. If I can go to game one of the finals, so can a lot of real fans. |Warriors|52
Maybe it's just the view from home.  I don't disagree with you, but the baron years the cameras were rattling on tv it was so loud and the announcers were constantly commenting on how deafening it was and that they'd never been in an environment like that.  I'm sure it's still loud, just yeah, different although still cool.|Lakers|-1
Where did you buy the tickets?  I'd sincerely love to know for my own future reference.  The cheapest I saw was $750, and that's from the 'official Warriors' email bulletin.\n\nAlso, $18.25/hr + commuting in on Bart puts you at nearly double the minimum wage of your neighbors for many parts of the Bay Area.  You're not rich by any means but that isn't exactly rock bottom.  There are tons people in the East Bay working multiple jobs simultaneously in retail / food service / etc who don't clear an equivalent paycheck.||2
Seat geek. 700 bucks for two tickets out the door. 18 bucks an hour in SF isn't minimum wage but it isn't shit either. |Warriors|3

It is amazing along with other well regarded sports animes i never gave a chance i decided to watch it and im glad i did especially as a huge basketball fan.||2
Thanks. ||1
I've tried watching several sports anime series and I've found Kuroko to be the the most consistently entertaining. Totally over-the-top and ridiculous at some parts, but it has good pacing and good characters that keep you invested even though it gets pretty unbelievable after the first season. \n\nLike whenever a main character gets a new near-supernatural skill your instinct is to cheer rather than scoff because there's been tons of buildup and you really want them to succeed.|Kings|3
Haha,  sounds entertaining.  Thank you. ||1
It's great if you come at it as bishie buddy/redemption anime where they happen to play some ridiculous basketball.  If you come looking for a serious sports anime you might be disappointed.  Personally it's one of my favourite shows, and I don't really watch much anime.|Raptors|5
Thank you. ||1
Pretty damn good, get past the first few intro episodes and it gets intense.||3

Man... Cavs had their best shot tonight. How do you get blown out with both splash brothers playing like shit?|Supersonics|340
The big three wasn't playing so good either that's how|Timberwolves|-2
To be fair, CAVS are away and all GSW did is defend homecourt.||-1
Not at all... This game made me optimistic. This is a really knee-jerk reaction. Everyone BUT the splash brothers were on fire tonight and Curry and Klay's problems looked, to me, to be caused by our defense moreso than just being off. You could see at the end when it was time to close it out and the Cavs were getting ready for garbage time when they went back to back on threes.|Cavaliers|-2
They didn't play like shit imo. You gotta look at all the attention the draw from the defense, them being on the floor opens up the court for everyone else ||1
Did you watch the game? Cavs bench was nonexistent, Livingston automatic, and their leading scorer (Kyrie) was not exactly the most efficient. Defensive strategy on Curry looks solid, and should note that he's helpless when LeBron switches on him. Klay was in foul trouble which gives Livingston / Barbosa minutes to exploit the obvious matchup issues. |Cavaliers|1
Bad choaching and defense.  Cav's CANT win when they let bench players score 45 points.||1
Because they have a really good team.|Trail Blazers|1
Shaun Livingston shot 80% from the field and Barbosa shot 100%...\n\nThis is common sense|Trust The Process|2
It's game one...and the entire GS team sans Steph/Klay were crazy hot. More like it was a good chance, but far from their best chance considering their role players played below average.|Wizards|3
Maybe too rested?||3
Iggy, Shaun, and Barbosa played extremely well. Draymond had some big plays as well. |Warriors|138

Draymond played twice as well tonight as basically any OKC game|Warriors|14

Really appreciating how well Thunder played after watching this game.|[OKC] Russell Westbrook|517
Yeah, you could tell right away how much more intense the OKC games were.  The dubs got bored it seemed in the third and then remembered to turn it on again in the fourth.  Shots were wide open all game, the paint was clear, the rebounding was much easier although TT is still a stud.  I don't mean to diss the Cavs but more props to the Thunder who have a helluva team.  |Warriors|1
How were the shots wide open the cavs played step and klay really well. ||1
I didn't really think they played them that well...but maybe I'll change my mind when I rewatch.  It could be that it just seemed wide-open when compared to the defense in the OKC series which was stifling.|Warriors|1
Thunder also shut down Livingston with their size. Most people don't know that we rely on him for 6-10 pts of the bench in that 2nd rotation. We weren't able to get that going until the 2nd half of game 7...|Warriors|1
It wasn't just the boards the Thunder pulled down, but their length altered and blocked a ton of shots. GSW was able to shoot really well in the paint and under 10 feet vs the Cav's. The thunder had ppl shook under the rim. |Lakers|1
You guys are basically the only team the Warriors have to actually be scared of. Last series further confirmed it|Warriors|3
I wish we could see a thunder cavs match up. Not saying GSW is going to win against the cavs just would have been some cool match ups with the thunder and the cavs|Heat|10
KD still fucked up down the stretch this game. smh|Celtics|-3
It's always amazing when the best players on the court guard each other.|Thunder|3
Honestly I feel like the GSW-OKC series was the true finals of the season. Although I'm not positive of how this one will turn out, there is no way it will be as good of a competition as the western conference finals. What a hell of a series that was|Warriors|6
It's nice, we already got to see the finals and the season is not even over!\n\n||5
Omg yes. I live overseas so i almost exclusively watched warriors games this year and didnt catch many cavs games. 3 minutes into this game I just shook my head thinking how OKC is so much better on off and def compared to the cavs.|Warriors|6
I didn't realize how well Roberson & Adams were on the boards. Going from those two to Love & JR made life so much easier. |Warriors|245
Except TT is a freaking monster on the offensive boards, jesus.|Wizards|1
This is what I tweeted about for most of the first half. It's crazy how good that combo is.. Scary good.|Pistons|2
I was wondering why Cleveland didn't use Mozgov more. I haven't followed their team at all this year, but I remember him being pretty effective against us last year. |Warriors|4
Adams is insane at grabbing boards. I was terrified every time the ball went up last series|Warriors|20
Yeah dude, Adams is terrifying.|Warriors|158
And 22|[BOS] Marcus Smart|1
The dude hunts my nightmares |[DAL] Dirk Nowitzki|2
I think the Cavs were relying on Thompson to have a similar impact as Adams, and he just didn't|West|4
Adams is gonna be an All Star pretty soon.|Thunder|4
That series against the thunder really made the dubs a hell of a lot better. Holy shit. |[GSW] Jason Richardson|48
This is actually what I expected. They had a tough series against OKC so GSW have the urgency, pressure,.and experience to compete in the finals. CLE breezed through the post season and now will have to fight for their lives. ||8
Yeah, even in the 2 they lost, they didn't really have a high intensity fight, they just trailed the whole game then lost.|Raptors|4
You're welcome|Thunder|57
Seriously. It's like night and day how less tense it is around the rim. |Warriors|49
If I told you Shaun Livingston lead the Warriors in points for game 1 you would have thought something went horrible wrong for them.|Lakers|166
Either simultaneous Steph and Klay injuries or a nuclear explosion in the Bay Area would be my only two explanations |Thunder Bandwagon|3
I would have assumed Curry got hurt for Livingston to get that many opportunities to shoot.||4

True story||7
Which is why this is such a bad loss for the Cavs. Both Steph and Klay weren't that hot and they still pull out the win easily.\n\nedit: I just feel like the Cavs should have been able to steal this one. They had way more points at the free throw line, I understand they didn't get anything from JR and maybe if they did it would be a much different story but in the final minutes they couldn't even make it close. |Bulls|534
Free throws are only worth one point, Warriors don't care about those.|Thunder|1
Not to state the obvious, but this will be a game the Cavs look back on and wish they would've won much like last years Game 1.  Not many  times you can say Steph and Klay have an off shooting night it certainly needed to be taken advantage of.|Cavaliers|1
It's because their game plan was about disrupting steph and klay, which they did excellently for 3 quarters. When the subs came in, their game plan wasn't as strong, they hadn't watched as much tape, etc and they got ripped because of it. Theyll fix it up for next game, who to rotate, etc. \n\n|Raptors|1
Damn why couldnt they do that in game 6 or 7 when they had to hit so many ridiculous shots for 2 narrow victories|Thunder|1
Has JR ever shown up in a big playoff series? I wouldn't trust him at all if I was a Cavs fan|Trail Blazers|1

>weren't that hot\n\nUnderstatement of the year.|[OKC] Russell Westbrook|1
"Weren\'t that hot" is an interesting way to spell shit. They were a combined 8-27 for 20 points.|Thunder|2
Not really, the Splash Bros weren't hot but pretty much everyone else was. That's even harder to defend tbh and probably won't be the case next game.|Cavaliers Bandwagon|12
That's a credit to Cleveland defense, but unfortunately all their focus was on the perimeter and the interior passing lanes opened up so much. Klay and steph shot poorly but played great. |Raptors|1
What if the splash bros are hot and everyone else is hot too|Spurs|35
GG Cavs\n|[BOS] Ray Allen|3
What if the cavs were hot too? Honestly with how they played in the first half it was a miracle they didn't get beaten by 30 points. The Warriors crowd is tough and they were also coming off some momentum from the OKC series. Honestly I don't think we can expect this game to be representative of the series. I think the cavs will give them a better game 2.||5
im still going with the cavs in 7, i was just joking but if both teams are hot i think gsw has the edge|Spurs|2
I love how people still truly objectively think the warriors can lose this series.||1

Haha I understand I was still a little salty about the loss xD. It would truly be scary if all of golden state's shooters were on point... ||1
he hasn't made an excuse yet|Timberwolves|21
That's a situation CLE obviously needs to avoid but we're forgetting that Thompsons foul trouble mixed with some solid defense on Steph is what led to the dubs bench having the opportunity to go off. Cavs picked their poison and it backfired, largely because 90% of their roster was sleepwalking. |Cavaliers|6
Over at /r/clevelandcavs there's a guy calling for realistic cabs fans to leave the sub and not come back. His reasoning: the cavs starters outplayed the warriors starters so the series is far from over.\n\nMeanwhile, the warriors bench just picked their team apart.|Warriors|3
>weren't that hot\n\nOne might even say they were the opposite of hot. That's why I love this team though, because it's an actual team and isn't solely reliant on one player. |Pistons|8
Weren't that hot?! A bit of an understatement.|[GSW] Chris Mullin|7
20 points combined has a to be a season low for when they both play 30+ minutes|Warriors|169
I know this is true because the broadcasters reminded me every other minute starting in the third quarter |Timberwolves|1
Did they both play 30 minutes? I thought play didn't play that much?|Hornets Bandwagon|1
You're right! Klay played only 24 mins. Curry played 35.|Warriors|2
It's a 2 year low according to ESPN.||1
Combined low in any Warriors win!|Celtics|5
29 was the lowest they had scored the entire season|Warriors|96
I wonder what their career low is with both playing over 30 min.|Warriors|1
if i had to bet, i'd say probably one of the stinker games in the final last year||2
Does that include when one or the other didn't play? Like when Steph was out did Klay have 29 or more every game?|Mavericks|2
I just saw that number during the broadcast so I don't remember all the restrictions. But I think it's probably when both play together|Warriors|3
That's what I would expect as well. I knew this was a season low from listening to the game, but am glad someone provided the previous number. Really puts it into context. |Mavericks|2
It's a season low period|Warriors|234
Like I think each game that either one of them didn't play the other scored enough to still make 20 tonight a season low for both...||3
That sounds true. I'm too bad at basketballreference to check though|Warriors|3
Probably a low, even when Curry was injured and not playing lol.|[TOR] Bruno Caboclo|10

Everytime I watch the warriors I'm always looking for Shaun Livingston to take an eventual 3 pointer but nope he just steps in swishes a mid range every time. |Heat|16
It\'s kind of crazy how quickly the way players approach the game has changed. I guess I have been spoiled by mid range jumpers by Paul pierce, kobe, dirk, etc, but it\'s almost become an "old man\'s shot". ||6

what would actually be an awesome story, the dude was on the brink of not being able to play basketball ever again. ||155
He was in danger of not walking again.  Forget playing sports.|Warriors|4
they thought they were going to have to amputate his leg. isn't that even crazier? i'm so happy to see him having this moment.||18

KD and westy(okc) are the only team capable of matching their firepower. |East|3
Problem is that their team has very little depth. I said it a few nights ago and it seems even more true tonight. The Warriors are DEEP with useful players. Guys like Livingston, Speights, Barnes, and Ezeli can all make big plays on any given night. On the other hand, OKC's depth didn't impress me at all besides Adams. Same with Cleveland. They have nobody on their bench who can really sustain a good level of play. |Warriors|1
And defending at a good enough level ||5
Like any team, they can go cold. It\'s just that when they go on those "little runs", instead of it being a 8-2 run over the course of a couple minutes, it\'s a 6-0 run within 30 seconds. \n\n||3
If OKC was even a little bit mentally stronger they could have taken that series. They lead a ton in those games. Only when GS would pull ahead by like 5-10 points they would absolutely cave.|Timberwolves|8

Honestly Irving was the very glaring weak link tonight. Love was pretty good, had a couple lapses but held up way better than expected. A looooot of the Warriors easy buckets came off bad decisions by Kyrie |Knicks|23

Dude Warriors set like 4 or 5 different 3 pt. shooting records in that series and through the first 4 games Westbrook was shooting better than Curry and Thompson from 3.

This was the perfect chance for the Cavs to steal game 1. Curry and Klay had a bad shooting night and the Cavs big three was scored 66. All they needed was a decent performance from their bench. \n\nAnnnnnd despite paying so much of the luxury tax to bring in seasoned vets, the Golden State bench roasted the Cavs bench. |Trail Blazers|1428
> and the Cavs big three was scored 66\n\n66 on 60 FGA, 17 FTA, and 11 TO.  That's pretty ugly.||1
Even if it was just a flat 66 on like 45 FGA 66 points in 4 quarters for any big 3 is really bad. For the Cavs to have a chance this series they need Lebron and Kyrie each to put up like 30 efficient points at least.||1
> the Cavs big three was scored 66.\n\nThey collectively shot poorly. |[LAL] Kareem Abdul-Jabbar|1
I mean, there was a reason WHY the bench did what they did. The Cavs were focusing all on Steph and Thomson. |Heat|1
They still played great D. Draymond look like his old self. Underrated best player tonight imo.|Warriors|1
The big three scored 66 on 60 shots and 17 FTs. That PPP isn't looking all that great from the stars if you're trying to sing praises.||1
Well, I don't know if it was the perfect chance really. Although Curry and Klay were quiet, the bench was lights out. We got phenomenal games from Iggy, Barbosa, and Shaun. Those guys are always solid, but tonight they took it a notch higher. |Warriors|1
benches tend to play better at home.  was the case for both okc and dubs players last round, and will prob be the same for this round|[GSW] Draymond Green|2
yeah i dont see how the cavs possibly win this. even if lebron goes batshit insane that still wont be a enough. really wish the thunder didnt blow it|Bucks|3
Lebron going batshit insane might win them a game. Or two.|Lakers|1
Gotta finish at the hoop. And hopefully get a few more calls.||3
Even Tristan Thompson played pretty well (double double). It was just a shit defensive performance, and a lot of turnovers from the Cavs.|Rockets|3
I don't understand how you can have such a high team salary and only be able to have a 9 man rotation.  ||3
When a teams bench kills it it's the worst time to steal a game |Lakers|3
It still baffles my mind how people deluded themselves that Frye was a deciding factor for the cavs lol|Warriors|4
they completely abandoned their offense and everything that got them to this point and it destroyed everything we've built for two months. how you expect Frye and JR to get looks and make an impact if you shove em in a corner while Kyrie and Lebron iso every possession? idiotic game plan that has to change ASAP if the Cavs are to have a chance. |[CLE] LeBron James|4
The team as a whole, and especially the Cavaliers' big 3, did a shit job of moving the ball and involving their bench players.  They reverted to what they were doing a month before the playoffs.|Cavaliers|3
i think steve kerr does a great job at incorporating literally everyone in the offense||4
Cavs also outscored the dubs 18-9 from the stripe. |USA|5
The Cavs shot twice as many free throws, the Warriors only hit 9-27 on 3s, and Steph and Klay only combined for 20 points and Cleveland still got blown out. Wow. ||6
They roasted the starters ||18
Surprisingly the Cavs 1-on-1 defense was fine in this game, Kevin Love and Tristan Thompson fared perfectly fine on switches. Where the absolutely massive defensive errors came were in the aspect of communication (the lack thereof or confusion) concerning defensive scheme. This was especially in regards to off ball and transition defense. Pick and roll defense was passable and helped them contain the GSW back court, however off-ball, the Cavs overreacted too much to their threat. Curry cutting back door ? His man and the guy in the paint switch on to him leaving Draymond/Barnes open. This happened time after time all game. The Cavs also resorted to stand around iso ball as opposed to moving the ball around, the lack of off ball cuts made me go insane. It\xe2\x80\x99s Golden State\xe2\x80\x99s off ball movement that constantly gets them good shots, opponent defenders have a hard time keeping man and ball in front of them so will always be a step behind. Seamless switching like OKC did is extremely rare and is something that after watching this game the Cavs are not capable of. I understand Lue going to Love early in 2Q to make as much use of Curry being out of the game but it threw their entire rotation out of whack and they didn't get Frye into the game or play that bench lineup that was so great. Lebron was incredibly passive in the 2nd half kicking out of nearly every drive or passing it to Kyrie and then standing and letting him iso. He needs to be moving much more on offense to put pressure on the Warriors defense. After letting the warriors bench get hot in the first half they smoked the Cavs to start the 4Q and blew the game open. Predictably Curry and Klay hit threes later in 4Q to stave off any comback. Cleveland either has to be much better offensively or defensively because besides the work they put in on Curry and Klay, their defense was utter trash and the offense wasn\xe2\x80\x99t much better. If they don\xe2\x80\x99t make adjustments, they are losing this quite handily. While they stayed close through 3Q that kind of performance will lead to a 15 pt lead for the Warriors next time.\n\nAlso a note on refs, they hardly called anything this game for both sides. I think they tried to be as fair as possible, it was just that Cavs were forced to take more contested shots inside (whereas most Warriors shots inside weren\xe2\x80\x99t contested as much if at all) so it felt like the weren\xe2\x80\x99t giving them the benefit of the doubt. |[PHI] Bobby Jones|255
k||-6
Is there a TL;DR for this shit||-10
Yes: TL;DR: the Warriors beat the snot out of the Cavs with their bench because the Cav's defense was focused on Steph and Klay.||6
I have had a feeling Lou is going to have a hard time playing Love and Frye this series. Wouldn't surprise me if Frye gets Kanter'd. It's BBQ chicken when they get that switch, just the grill ran out of gas to tonight.\n\nThat's my chess piece match up of his series, will Lou be stubborn and play Frye to get points or will he give in to Blatt ball?\n\nIt's a high risk high reward playing Frye the Dubs imo. |[GSW] Calbert Cheaney|1
What you brought up about Lebron is the most frustrating to watch with him. They're down by 10 with like 5 minutes left and he gets the ball vs someone other than Iggy (can't remember who it was). He is basically unstoppable when he drives it to the basket. At worst he's probably going to get fouled. Instead, he stops and passes it to the corner to Love, or like you said to Kyrie. God, I usually hate hero ball, but damn he just doesn't attack down the stretch like he used to. In the 4th quarter, he had 5 points, 3 assists and that dagger of a turnover. ||2
Dude....please do this for every game. Seriously. That was incredible.|[GSW] Draymond Green|2
You might have a good point in there somewhere, but you wrote it in a painfully large block. You might want to reformat.|Warriors|12
Yeah you're right. It's basically a stream of consciousness so I understand if it's hard to follow, I will structure it better in the future. |[PHI] Bobby Jones|3
To be fair, if they can shut Curry and Thompson down like this in Cleveland, there's a good chance a bunch of those open looks don't go down (role players' shooting never travels as well). \n\nStill, they need to be sharper and more focused in every aspect to have a real shot. This is obviously the biggest challenge they've faced in this post season, they need to remember the fire they had last year.|[BKN] Markel Brown|4
The cavs offense is iso ball. Still don't understand why lue gets credit for doing nothing different from blatt||7
Disagree, throughout the Playoffs they've been moving the ball side to side and actually running sets besides a high PnR. Some of that stems from being able to push the ball in transition and their inability to get stops today coupled with the reversion to iso ball caused there offense to stagnate. |[PHI] Bobby Jones|4
Nice writeup|Warriors|24
You really thought the switches demonstrated by CLE were passable? I felt like the Warriors got a ton of looks off the PnR and great open shots from bad communication on screens...honestly from my perspective OKC played so well against GSW because they made them work so hard for their shots -- I didn't see CLE do the same tonight. \n\nEdit: agree, nice write up. |Supersonics|30
They switches I meant first were more regarding bigs on to Curry/Klay. Every one thought they would just run multiple picks with Green/Bogut and let them go to work but they fared well then. However like you say they got a ton of open looks of PnR because of the attention they were drawing. |[PHI] Bobby Jones|4
Golden states bench is fuckin stacked though. Livingston looked like MJ out there. |Rockets|975
Aberration nights happen. Golden State's bench is not going to be that dominant every game. Cleveland's bench needs to step the fuck up though.\n\nedit: something like 12 different people have replied to point out Steph and Klay won't play that badly. I figured that went without saying.|Supersonics|367
So true. Bench mobs always play better at home too. Just look at every GSW vs. OKC game this season.|Warriors|1
They don't but if you get them when they need to happen you win championships |Raptors|1
Agree with everything you said|[LAL] Sasha Vujacic|1
There's pretty much nothing else you can ask of your bench in a finals match up than to win you a game. Great stuff|Warriors Bandwagon|1
They probably won't be this good. But they will still be pretty good. If Steph and Klay show up, and the defense stays locked in like it was for most of the game, Cavs are gonna have a tough time. I still think they'll win at least one at home though.|Warriors|1

Yeah but literally no one on the Cavs bench is good at both ends of the floor. Channing Frye doesn't cut it against the Warriors |Cavaliers Bandwagon|1
The key will be the road games. The bench did struggled on the road against OKC, but have a much better match up this time. Time will tell if they can keep it up|Warriors|1
JR needs to shoot WTF was he doing out there?? Chuck 3s JR!!|Heat|2
JR not chucking hurts my soul. I love that man. |Warriors|1
And Steph and Klay aren't going to be trash every night. It goes both ways.\n|Warriors|2
And steph and klay aren't going to suck dick every night|[GSW] Jason Richardson|2
Idk man, the bench wasn't hitting crazy shots. Those Livingston and Iguodala shots are going to be there for the taking all series. |Warriors|12
Steph and Klay won't be that bad tho|Cavaliers|28
you know what else won't happen every game? steph and klay both shooting like shit.|[HOU] Moochie Norris|60
Got heeem|Warriors|1
Then again, Curry and Thompson are probably not going to be that bad every game.|Warriors|589
And the Cavs aren't going to miss 15 open lay ups either.  Shit happens.|Kings|-5
CLE probably wont shoot 35ish percent from the field hopefully. |Hornets|1
lol|Cavaliers|1
Turns out they were |[HOU] Tracy McGrady|1
Well, if Kia commercials have taught me anything about math, it's currently 1/1 or 100%.|Kings|1
I also don't think Irving is going to shoot 7-22 though.|East|1
Goddamn this team pls nerf|Pistons|1
But do you think they could possibly do better than Livingston and co did? Because that's not likely. Adding one removes the other to a certain extent. |76ers|2
As I said in another comment, Curry and Klay average 51.9 this postseason, Barbosa and Livingston 12.8. If they go back to average, it balances out to +12.9. Add to that the mismatch of Livingston and every player except for LeBron. I am pretty convinced they will be allright.|Warriors|2
Yes but it's not like the Cavs played a good game. If we're going strictly by averages, they'd have done a lot better too. |76ers|2
True as well, we just have to wait and see how game 2 turns out before we can really judge wether it's down to the good/bad defense or to good/bad offense.|Warriors|1
Totally agree. I still think the Warriors have the upper hand, but I'd love for the Cavs to make things interesting. |76ers|1
This was literally their worst combined performance in the entire season. Some of it can be chalked up to the Cav's defense, but they missed a lot of shots that they usually make.|[NYK] Langston Galloway|206
sounds like we've been saying that the whole playoffs. they just haven't shot that efficiently since the beginning of the okc series |Suns|0
> sounds like we've been saying that the whole playoffs\n\nKlay and Curry each averaged significantly more PPG in these playoffs than the 20 points they combined for in this game. So no.\n\n>they just haven't shot that efficiently since the beginning of the okc series\n\nCurry's TS% in the OKC series was just about the same as his TS% in his career; higher than Lebron in these playoffs. So no.\n|[NYK] Langston Galloway|5
I want the lowlight reel!!!|Warriors|1
I want the lowlight reel!!!|Warriors|1
Saw a couple comments on Twitter saying it looked like the Cavs basically only researched how to guard Steph and Klay. Seems true after tonight lol|Warriors|1
A lot of both outliers is the Cavs blanketing Steph and ~~Curry~~ Klay (I'm a moron) on defense. |Warriors|86
Nah, a lot of the problem is they both looked like shit.  Steph and Klay missing easy layups, wide open 3's, and just generally stinking up the court.\n\nI don't think the Cavs are going to have any better chance than they had last night.  Maybe Klay will be off in a game, and Steph will be off in another...but they will not have another game this series where both of them play like Taco Bell shit stains...sloppy and awful.\n\nNot that the Cavs won't potentially win a game or 2...but this was absolutely their game to steal.|Bulls|1
that's in part what allowed the other players to step up so much. defense spent too much time and attention focused on steph and klay, allowing others to get open looks|Lakers|1
But, now they've been shown that even if they shut down steph and klay, the Warriors can still drop big offensive numbers. I guess they've got to figure out some way to guard everyone like they're steph curry, which is pretty ridiculous.||1
not really. barbosa and livingston were just hitting contested iso jumpers and runners all night.|Pistons|1
To be fair, Steph is like two guys sometimes||1
Yep they were straight double teaming them a lot of the time. Really roughing up steph off ball too. Good defense.\n\nBut then they were getting lost in transition and miscommunicating on switches. Weird game for the cavs defensively|Knicks|3
>Steph and curry |Warriors|121
**Charlie:** No, I'm Holland Oates. You're like, Peter Gabriel.\n\n**Mac:** Hall & Oates is two separate people.\n\n**Charlie:** No, Holland is his first name and Oates is his last name.|Pistons|3
If you say it quickly it just sounds like his full name|Thunder Bandwagon|3
"Steph and Curry"\n\nI believe it\'s spelled Stephen Curry!|Trail Blazers|14
FAIR POINT|Warriors|19
there is no aberration about shaun hitting those 2s though. that's his thing.||236
Yes, same as the Xmas game.|Warriors|1
And it\'ll just keep happening unless the Cavs switch someone taller than 6\'2" onto him.  |[UTA] Rudy Gobert|2
8-10 though|Kings|7
He will consistently hit 6 or 7 of 10 with the quality of looks he got. So maybe he got an extra 2 or 4 points than an average game, but if they keep playing him like this expect him to continue to have big games.  |Warriors|3
"Bread and butter"  - Livingston |Warriors Bandwagon|3
Best part of the interview.|Warriors|2
That's because Cleveland is sending J.R., Kyrie, and Dellie at him.|Warriors|7
Yeah, he did it when Curry was out too. Was really efficient with that mid-range jumper. Struggled last series cause of OKC's length, but he has a great match up this series. I doubt he'll have 20 point performances, but he's pretty reliable with that shot|Warriors|21
That's his bread and butter yeah, but the dude couldnt miss tonight|Kings|9
if you give him that turnaround or midrange jumper you can expect high efficiency from him though. I don't know what else to say other than you guys haven't watched enough warrior ball this season.||7
all i said was that he was particularly on fire tonight.. |Kings|1
I think what people are saying is that he wasn\'t really "particularly on fire".  He does this consistently when he gets that turnaround jumper on shorter defenders.  80% is a little high, but really not anything too shocking I don\'t think.  He is always money at those shots.  |Warriors|3
yep.. anytime he gets that hang time, he locks in and drains them. It blows my mind.|Pistons|12
Three things in life are certain. Death, taxes and Shaun Livingstone hitting midrange jumpers.|Warriors|135
Oh that was beautiful to watch!||1
And Arsenal finishing above Tottenham|Raptors|2
Shaun with Kyrie or Delly defending is buttah on my toast|[GSW] Calbert Cheaney|4
specifically turnaround midrange jumpers. Dude must've been a huge MJ fan in the 90s|Cavaliers|15
Who wasn't?||1
Tbf, there's no one on the Cavs that have the length to stop him from shooting those 15 footers. I guess Thompson or LeBron could, but you can't commit those kinds of assets to fucking Shaun Livingston. |[LAL] Kobe Bryant|279
How does that work?   Is doing that to someone in the middle of jump shooting a foul?  Do you have to split a bottle of wine with them before the game?||1
how about just to guarding him?|Warriors|1
I dont think Livingston is going to play like MJ every game tho|Spurs|7
And Steph and Klay aren't going to play like warm doo doo every game, so...|[LAL] Kobe Bryant|19
He's so sexy though.|Vancouver Grizzlies|13
It's those long sexy grasshopper legs |Warriors|1
That scar under his eye looks great. |Spurs|1
I'm pretty sure Kyrie physically cannot block him and Livingston knows it. Ultimate confidence with that in mind, and big change from OKC|Knicks|159
Yeah there were a few pull up jumpers (I know, all of his shots are pull up jumpers) where he didn't even create space for himself. He just sent straight up in the defenders face and was too vertical too quickly for them to do anything about it. |Warriors|1
Shaun was doing those shots all day vs Houston and Portland. Only the Thunder's size have been able to stop it. I predict he'll average close to 10 points this series, if not more.|[GSW] Draymond Green|3
Yeah I mean the length and athleticism was really in all their heads. |Warriors|7
Yeah that one he made right before Lue called the timeout (I think this put them up 10), You can see Kyrie's arm fully extended and Livingston's release is still like 5 inches higher. |76ers|11
Yeah to Kyrie's credit that was a perfect contest, he just physically cannot reach that high.|NBA|4
Roberson and KD are a nightmare to Shoot over. Even Broadie with his insane vertical could contest those...|Timberwolves|79
TIL KD has a 7 foot 5 wingspan...|Hornets|0
Its all about that wingspan|Raptors|9
Also, Dion knew how to dig-in and plays decent post D. More than decent, in fact.|Warriors|30
Impressed as fuck when he had Dray on him and didn't call for a double. Dray backed him down but the effort fucked up his attempt.|Lakers|1
Great Post D, not only digging in but rotating at the perfect angle to Livingston's rotation to be able to crowd as effectively as possible on the turnaround - knowing full well that Livingston has no counter-move|East|2
Dion is the only guy who I can remember consistently stopping Livingstons post move.||9
Westbrook gave him a hard time too. They're both really strong and physical, it seemed to disrupt his rhythm.|Warriors|6
They forgot to shut down the third Splash Brother...\n\nThe midrange step brother, Shaun Livingston|Hornets|651
Livingston is a bad man on the court. Those midrange Js are insane |Rockets|1
The splish brother|[SAS] Tim Duncan|1
Livingston's shot makes no splash, always just slides in like the hoop absorbs the ball.|Warriors|1
I thought the 3rd Splash Brother was Mo Buckets...\n\nI was really hoping for a Channing Frye - Mareese Speights showdown. |Warriors|1
I always say, Livingston is the Steph Curry of 2's.|Warriors|1
sploosh brother|Warriors|2
I love that he's still a force. That injury had me thinking he was done, and yet look at his career. Love me some Livingston |NBA|3
next game will be the adopted midrange step brother Mo Buckets|Warriors|5
*splash uncle|Warriors Bandwagon|10
Adopted Splish bro|Warriors Bandwagon|4
He was like Kobe out there ||3
I swear he never misses those turnaround mid range shots. |Cavaliers Bandwagon|5
He missed at least a thousand during the OKC series|Warriors|2
There's just so much depth to the GSW bench though... they're like the Rebel Alliance - the tighter the Cavs clench their D, the more shots slip through their fingers.||12

Best part about that, in the video, you can't even hear what Steph is saying. ESPN decided it was more important to have an ESPN logo next to Steph, than to actually hear what he had to say..||50
I know the Cavs played like shit but Lue has got to come up with something more than stick love in the corner and iso Lebron and everyone watch and not move. |Lakers|59

Wow... Way to show you're not biased in favor of some bullshit narrative. \n\nJackasses.\n\nEdit: Referring to ESPN. |Kings|-17
He's just making fun of espn for some graphic guy's fuck up. What narrative are you talking about?|Warriors|16
Do you think there's just the one graphic guy, and he makes it and puts it up live without at least one other person checking it before it goes on air?\n\nSure, they make mistakes, but for the graphic guy's mistake to go by whoever is supposed to be checking it to make sure it's correct there has to be something about the mistake that makes sense to the person checking.\n\nThey want LeBron to win. They are invested in their LBJ narrative. |Kings|-25
Okay no, I don't think any major sports outlet wants LeBron to win. To be honest everybody has been riding the warriors dick so hard this year. Its justified though I'm not gonna lie, but they want the warriors to win. This was nothing more than a mistake. |[OKC] Kevin Durant|6

It was against the Braves. They could field a team of gerbils and still get at least three runs. |[ATL] Dennis Schr\xc3\xb6der|20

We actually split this series against the Braves.|Warriors|4

missing persons alert issued for JR Smith|Cavaliers|220
The Pipeman just couldn't lay it down tonight.||1
I was getting legit pissed when JR was standing unguarded in the 3-point sweet corner but Lebron went for the triple-defended layup instead for a block/turnover. WHY? This happened more than a couple times, I think.|Cavaliers|1
Yeah I saw those all over New York for a couple years until he popped up in Cleveland||2
He only got the ball 3 times||2
I think that hand injury really hurt him|Heat|9
he just lost some skin|Warriors Bandwagon|3
On his shooting hand, that will cause him to not want to shoot.|Heat|8
tis a flesh wound|Warriors Bandwagon|6
Played some good D on Klay tho. But definitely needs to do more offensively |Pistons|8
This is underrated, though. I think the hit to Klay's production was worth more than hitting 2-3 more shots. Obviously, if he goes off and has a JR Special with 6-7 3s or something that's worth more.\n\nBut give me average day JR or defensively locked in JR, throwing himself at loose balls and shutting down a scorer of Klay's caliber... I pick today's JR every time. \n\nIf he can maintain that mindset, and pull the trigger a few more times (especially back in Cleveland), he can make a real difference in this series.|[BKN] Markel Brown|12
his body language was pretty frustrating to watch as a cavs fan. he was moping around in the 2nd half. |Cavaliers|5

Ah yes, the Mike Brown offense|Cavaliers|1
Game was close until it wasn't. \n\nQuick thoughts:\nWarriors really showed off their depth tonight--that run in the third quarter was huge; the Cavs bench really had no answer for Shaun Livingston. Will be interesting to see how Cleveland adjusts in Game 2.\n\nBiggest part tonight, I felt was the defense on Lebron by Igoudala and Green, specifically Igoudala's ability to strip the ball without fouling which pretty much shut down a good part of the Cav's defense. \n\nAlso: the Cavs got blown out with Thompson and Curry bricking a good portion of their shots--that's definitely not a good sign moving forward.\n\nSuper lopsided game, but we saw with the OKC-Spurs series why it's bad to draw overarching conclusions from the first game. Hopefully the extended time off helps the Cavs figure things out for next game.|Bulls|199
Heck even the OKC-GWS game 1. ||3
> Super lopsided game, but we saw with the OKC-Spurs series why it's bad to draw overarching conclusions from the first game. \n\n**THIS!!!!**|[DAL] Dirk Nowitzki|2

Klay played some good d on bron as well|Warriors|3
I think they prepared by renting a bull and taping a basketball to its horns.  Then they have to practice backpedaling and swiping.  It's almost as dangerous as LeBron driving.|Warriors|11
Green did well on Kyrie too.  Really impressive.|Celtics|4
[deleted]||63
How about watching the baseline, not being stagnant on offense, better bench rotations, more Frye, keep your defensive assignments in mind but watch weak side cutter. \n\n\n\n\n\nYou realize playoff basketball is a game of adjustments right? ||1
Their two stars shot like shit, but everyone else was shooting unreal. Cavs defense wasn't even bad--they were contesting a good deal of those shots. But for large swathes of the game it was like GSW couldn't miss a shot to save their lives. Got a defender draped all over you? Doesn't matter, shot's going in. Got fouled hard? Doesn't matter, shot's going in. Off balance shot, wild toss banked shot, behind the back shot with eyes closed? Doesn't matter, shot's going in. These guys could have had their arms and legs chopped off and they'd be flopping like fish on the court and their shots would somehow go in. You simply can't beat a team playing like that.  \n\nI want to think they won't shoot that hot for the rest of the series, but this is GSW we're talking about. I'd definitely rather deal with Curry/Klay scoring 70 than have to deal with the rest of the team going Infinity Gauntlet on the Cavs.  \n\nJust my 2 cents. |Cavaliers|1
Do the same thing on Curry and Klay. Then pray that Livingston doesn't turn into MJ again. |Mavericks|1
Exactly what I'm thinking, they can adjust as much as they want against warriors bench. But they will never know when Klay and curry are gonna get hot again and trash any adjustments they made.|Warriors|3
They over helped in the switch with Curry and Klay and that led to some pretty wide open shots from us. Now, if I'm Lue I'm cool with Green taking an open three or lettting Barnes post up on JR. I think both coaches know that Livingston or any other role player isn't going to win us three more games. For the most part I liked how Cleveland defended our two best players. The thing is, if you screw up the switch and that leads to an open layup or dunk then that's what you should adjust.|Warriors|10
SHAUN LIVINGSTON 2016 NBA FINALS MVP.\n\nSeriously though, the warriors bench was the x-factor in this one. They outplayed their matchups , and were extremely efficient at the same time.|Raptors|587
Midrange assassin.|Warriors|1
The dubs bench was seriously outplaying clevelands starting unit for part of the 3rd. |Warriors|1
18/25 for 44 points...thats better than most teams starters. You have to only assume that won't be happening again because Livingston had as many points as Curry and Klay combined ffs|Cavaliers|2
I think it's crazy the Cavs did such a good job keeping Klay and Steph out of sync but had no plan for the bench. How do you not know know Livingston is going to do the pretty mid-range jumper 9 times of 10? |Warriors|59
I was there, I have not followed the season at all, but watching him it was just like "who the fuck is this guy and why are all his shots going in"||2
It's been his shot his whole career and the Cavs had no defense for it. Mid-range jumper over anyone under 6'10 it's all he does and they looked clueless against Livingston.||2
Yeah I don't think it was the Cavs.  Rather Curry and Klay just missed wide open shots they usually sink.|Warriors|2
Because Livingston doesn't give a fuck if they know or not. He just sinks them even when they know it's coming.|Warriors|8
[deleted]||21
Cuz he's long n' sexy|Warriors|2
Barbosa too. He can definitely make those weird floaters, but they're not high percentage shots for him generally.|Warriors|2
Hard to call Sdot's shots contested. With his hops, height and reach, it isn't really impeding him much. Durant does the same thing with better range.||17
He's the super poor man's Durant.|Warriors|6
You know that was Lue\'s gameplan. \n\n"Shut down Curry and Thompson, and we\'ve won this game. Who\'s going to step up for them? Livingston? Barbosa? HAH!"|Kings|41

Sorry casual fan here. What does the +22 numbers represent?||2
It's called plus/minus and basically shows how the team performed with a player on the field vs. with him off the field. As far as I understand it, in this case it means that when Iguodala was on the field the Warriors outscored the Cavs by 22 (per 100 possessions).|Warriors|3

Um Jason Kidd is the poster child for this arc||1
With this team, he is often catching passes in perfect rhythm...it makes a huge difference|Celtics|2
He's always been an average 3 point shooter in terms of percentages. Iggy's more of the streaky type though. |Warriors|60
I think he made back to back 3s after the nut shot from Delly (def at least one 3 immediately after). He has a weird way of making shots when it's important.|Warriors|2
He saves them all for Cleveland. Especially in the Q. A couple months ago I looked up his career stats vs Cleveland as a warrior and he looks like a poor man's LeBron.|[GSW] Draymond Green|4
It must be just be from the high pace of the game, but whenever I see him get a wide open 3 99% of the time he makes it.\n\n|Rockets|15

He tries, he is just terrible at it. Very difficult for a guy that small to be a naturally dominant defender. Look at how long it took Steph to become even an average defender. |Suns|0
Yeah and his 20 second dribbling possessions don't allow for any flow on the offense either |Warriors|8

He did play great defense though. Shows how great the 2 can be even when Theyre not scoring|Bulls|12
He single handedly saved the season in game 6 at OKC. \n\nKlay can relax now...the bench will clean up these games. |Warriors|247
Man what a luxury to say this at a finals game. |Bulls|3
Fuck man Klay ruthlessly killed us :(|Thunder|21
He did you guys so dirty, that he even pulled up from thirty.|[LAL] Nick Young|21
Admit it. You've been waiting to drop that for days||8
He also kept the Warriors in the game during crucial stretches of game 7. It seemed like every time the Warriors were letting the game slip away, Klay would drop a couple of threes and keep the team in it until his teammates woke the fuck up.|Spurs|48

Watching this Cavs team made me appreciate how good Thunder were on the defensive end.|Lakers|140
Boards generally too.|Bucks|5
It blew my mind how good OKC\'s defense was during the playoffs. They looked like by far the best defensive team in the league. Super long, athletic, and generally smart with rotations. Can\'t believe the Warriors edged by them.\n\nZach Lowe said something like, "They don\'t look like they\'re just playing really good defense; they literally look like a completely different team than the one from the regular season."|Warriors|40
Tough game, our interior defense was piss poor and we missed way too many shots at the rim. But I think our main problem was that OKC fucking choked and blew a 3-1 series lead. Thanks a fucking lot, OKC|Cavaliers|187
I honestly think OKC-Cavs would have had much more entertaining games than this series since those two are actually much more evenly matched and it would have been interesting to see if KD could finally get over Bron.|[NYK] J.R. Smith|4
lol, chill dude, it's one game.  |Warriors|-1
Sorry, didn't realize I wasn't allowed to express an opinion on here. \xf0\x9f\x99\x84 Not saying this series won't be entertaining as well, just think Thunder-OKC would have been more entertaining due to stylistic matchup and skill level being closer.|[NYK] J.R. Smith|10
Don't worry I agree with you, I think if the Thunder were in the East then the Finals would be Warriors Thunder.|Warriors|2

My bad, meant OKC-Cavs, accidently typed Dubs instead|[NYK] J.R. Smith|2
They already played the OKC-Dubs series.\n\nSo either it was more entertaining for you or it wasn't.|Spurs|2
Meant OKC-Cavs, the KD vs Bron part kinda hinted at why I thought it would be more entertaining.|[NYK] J.R. Smith|2
Do you really think OKC is that much worse than the Warriors?\n\nSorry to break it to you, but OKC would likely beat you guys too. It would just be a lil more dramatic.|[GSW] Draymond Green|5
If you considered regular season games, the Cavs were 2-0 against OKC this year, one of those games were without Irving or Shump, and the other was a 23 point win.|Cavaliers|-1
To be fair, we were also 0-3 against the warriors and nearly took that series. The playoffs thunder were on another level to where they were during the regular season. |Thunder|3
That is true, but playoff Cavs have also been playing on another level. But against a weaker conference, no doubt.|Cavaliers|0
If we were to talk about regular season, cavs are going to get swept now.||13
Just like the Cavs would sweep the thunder in the finals? Yeah makes sense.|Cavaliers|-7
The Cavs do not match up well against OKC.  The Cavs would have had a hard time winning because of the 7 footers and the fact that no one on your team would have been able to cover WestBrick.  The only thing that would be in your favor is the Curse of the Sonics, but the Curse of Cleveland is seemingly of equal strength.||13
Idk about that, Cleveland handily beat the Thunder twice this season, one of the games being without Irving or Shumpert. |Cavaliers|2
Yeah, but that last series wasn't OKC of the regular season.  That was a healthy, motivated OKC that could beat any body most days, the Warriors just happened to be the team who can beat everybody almost all days.||1
Regular season Thunder =! Playoff Thunder|Bulls|13
While I normally hate this cliche... In this case, it's legit. They were just playing like a completely different team.|Warriors|3

This isn't your average everyday shitpost.\n\nThis is... advanced shitposting. |Celtics|2
He is ultimately asking if the Cavs scored more total points throughout all games but still won 3 and lost 4 would they win. And they wouldnt, but that makes me wonder if a losing team has ever scored more total points in the finals. ||2
Aggregated scoring like in soccer, not really a shit post, could just be his first time watching a playoff series |Lakers|3

they need people like you with this answer instead of downvotes on that post\n\nWhat kind of people downvote genuine questions?- the average redditor is that kind of people\n\n ||1
And in Europe. Well eurocup at least |[LAL] Kobe Bryant|1
Really? How does that work. |Spurs|1
Two games, whoever scores more goes through. If both teams  score the same amount, the team that scored more goals in their away game goes through. If both teams score the same amount of away goals, there's extra time, then there is penalties.||8
yea but we have 2 games you have an uneven about |Warriors|2
What? no.\n\nScore only matters when the games are splitt.|Pistons|18
Well technically, the team with the most goals over two games goes through. That's how it works. ||0
Right but since this is a series it could get confusing to someone who is used to aggregated scoring. I get why he posted it, probably just comes from a different background.|76ers Bandwagon|42
It kind of sucks. \n\nI remember someone mentioned that people assume that everyone posting here has at least around the same amount of knowledge as them when it comes to basketball and the league. So sometimes honest questions get asked and people think they are trolling. |Bulls|24
Yea I made a post about the cutest players and all I got were downvotes and people calling me troll.\n\nI\'m just like "Yall don\'t like cute athletes too? Ok."|Wizards|2
you hot little analslutfrog~!|Rockets|2
Sorry, Analslutfrog, but this isn't really the thread for that discussion.|Warriors|2
At a certain point they need to just google it, we don\'t need a bunch of posts that are yes/no questions.  There\'s no room for discussion in that thread, someone would just say "No the NBA doesn\'t use aggregate" and then we might as well be Yahoo Answers.  The information is out there, we aren\'t really the place for questions like that.|[UTA] Rudy Gobert|38
Plus, for a new person I'm sure a comment in a game thread or something would be well received by the community, as opposed to a thread of its own. |Thunder|12
First two sentences from Wikipedia:  \n>The NBA Finals is the championship series of the National Basketball Association played between the Western and Eastern champions of the Conference Finals. **The first team to *win* four games** in the best-of-seven game series is declared the league champion and is awarded the Larry O'Brien Championship Trophy.    \n*Emphasized for clarity*  \n\n\nIf you don't know about some sport the first thing you're going to do is read up on it a bit, not just straight up post to reddit with zero thought on it. |Mavericks|17
I'll admit that this one was easy to look up. |Bulls|5
Yeah this is aggregated series scoring |Pistons|121
I think OKC would have won the last series by aggregate points and quarters won. But I'm too lazy to do the math to prove it. |Warriors|5

Yeah UK fan here and that's clearly the situation.\n\nFor some a reason I will never understand, 'series' in soccer last 2 games. An even number. Which is fucking mental. So we have to aggregate the score from the 2 games to see who wins and also and away goal is weighted against a home goal.\n\nIts the most ridiculous shit.||14
I dunno. I prefer it over one team being in advantage of having more home games. Pretty fair system if you ask me.||5
Nothing is better than advancing on away goals. ||5

> Cavs need to work on their freethrows\n\nSeriously? That was one of the few things we got right. If you were actually looking for discussion, they need to work on their defense more than anything, as well as hitting some more shots|[CLE] Matthew Dellavedova|3

"Lebron has the most help he has ever had"|Heat|210
I almost feel bad for Lebron and Cleveland. He did the (IMO) honorable thing, went back, and tried to win one for the hometown. Yet it's the same problem as before: They've failed to put a championship caliber team around him. I can't imagine how frustrating it must be to be a top 5 player in the world and be stuck with teammates who are clearly inferior compared with the team you're trying to beat. |Warriors|6
Nah, it's just that LeBron isn't transcendent anymore, those were his last year's on Cleveland and first years w Heat. He's just great now.\n\nAlso, and more importantly the Dubs have put together no less than 8 really good players and a ten man potential rotation. You can't compete w that and a transcendent Steph.|Mavericks|3
He didn\'t go back cuz it was the "honorable" thing to do. He went back because he saw an opportunity to play with a younger duo in love and Irving. The hometown angle is the positive spin he put on it so he wouldn\'t get shit on again. Dudes calculated about everything.||8
Totally agree -- he saw greener pastures after getting washed in 2014, the Wiggins pick gave them opportunity to get another max player (they just got the wrong one imo). Should've stayed in Miami, Pat Riley knows how to build a winning team. ||2
Riley would have reloaded the team again no doubt. He thought he could take the blueprint and run. He's learning it ain't that easy. The heat culture is a very real thing.||1
he has an opt out at the end of the year.  Maybe he'll join the warriors.|Lakers|5
You might be joking, but I actually think it's possible. I remember reading an interview with him mid-season and he had some glowing words about the team/franchise/fans. Also, he played for the Oakland Soldiers AAU team when he was in high school. He has some ties to this area. It would not be the craziest thing ever. Barnes out. Lebron in. |Warriors|-7

They would've done better that the Cavs imo. But yeah.||15
Yeah, I never bought that.  He won nine more games in 2013, and no one would pick Love over Bosh or Irving over Wade.  People just like overreacting.  "Oh, they only lost two games in the playoffs?  Best Lebron team everrrrrr..."|Raptors|69
I might pick playoff love over playoff bosh. Dude was not a huge asset for the Heat in the playoffs from what I remember.|Cavaliers|-21
He played defense, people usually don't remember that. |Heat|27
Dude was and is still criminally underrated in my opinion. His ability to completely change his offensive game to mesh with Bron and Wade while also playing stellar defense in space was crucial to those title runs. His abilities as a defender allowed for their havoc-style trapping and ball-hawking.|[PHI] JaKarr Sampson|5
In hindsight yes. I do remeber people were adamant that Bosh wasn't even a max player, Wade was finished. Remember the 'its not a big 3, but big 2'. I believe it was NBA on TNT analyst and HOFer Shaquille O'Neal who said that. ||11
If that argument were made in 2014, I could at least understand it a bit.  That 2013 Heat team could definitely push this Warriors team, though, more than these Cavaliers.\r\r(Watch Lue adjust fabulously in game two and prove us all wrong yet again.)|Raptors|1

2011 had: mike bibby, erick dampier, big Z (good luck spelling it), and jerry fucking stackhouse lol  \n  \n2012 got rid of all the old timers and brought in some youth.  \n  \n2013 added: Ray Allen, Birdman, Rashard lewis, as well as carrying over almost everyone from the year before.  \n  \n2014: the only moves I see that have ANY impact is losing mike miller. But they did pick up greg oden (lol) I'm not saying this year wasn't stacked but the spurs put a whoopin on them so its hard to give them praise.|Spurs|1
Bringing in rookies is usually a step back in short run, unless it is high powered talent. \n\nYouth usually take some time to settle down, learn d etc.\n\nSo I would put 2012 as less stacked than 2014 (despite mike miller). The counterargument would be aging of battier, haslem etc..|Lakers|2
They were more top-heavy than stacked. Depth was never great for the Miami teams. |Cavaliers|2

I feel like LeBron had 3 or 4 turnovers on possessions that would have been layups and they all came right as Cleveland started to make a run and they always ended with GS points at the other end.\n\n* Tristain Thompson got paid 82 mil??????\n\n* Where is the heart for the Cavaliers? This can't really be backed up with stats but when they went on that great run and took the lead, they didn't really capitalize on it. I mean the Warriors immediately went on a 25-4 run or whatever and Cleveland's starters got nuked from orbit by Golden State's bench. No intensity. Idk. The Cavaliers are a weird team.\n\nOverall I'm just confused as to how Cleveland somehow looked worse tonight than in any game in last year's series. I still think they can win game 2 and maybe steal the series in 6 or 7 but they just did not look prepared.\n\nOne very positive thing that I think might be sustainable for the Cavs is that they played great defense on Curry for most of the game. I doubt he'll only have 11 again but it looks like they made a blueprint to contain him but didn't have a blueprint for literally anything else.|Wizards|23
The "Thompson got payed 82 million" meme is so stupid. He played fine.\n\nCavs definitely weren\'t prepared, but if the crowd is like that for game 2, they might steal it. I mean: do people really expect the Cavs to shoot <40% the whole series?\n\nDid you notice how physical they were with Curry? Bron was manhandling him off ball every possession. I definitely think that should continue. |Hawks|0
> The "Thompson got payed 82 million" meme is so stupid. He played fine\n\nPlaying "fine" is different than "playing like you\'re worth $82M".  Now, I\'m sure even TT knows he aint worth that much and just extorted it from the Cavs because they couldn\'t replace him but if you make that much and just play "fine" you deserve the criticism.\n|Raptors|2
> I have no idea what Tyronn Lue was doing. Why did Shumpert play 17 minutes and Frye only played 7? How did JR play 36 minutes and only take 3 shots? Where was the offense? What was the offense? Seemed like every play was either a missed layup after an ISO possession or a Kyrie fadeaway.\n\nThis is the part that absolutely confuses me.  I heard leading up to this again and again how Channing Frye was going to be a difference maker.  I heard so much about the unstopabble Lebron + Frye + RJ + Delly + Shumpert lineup was.  But where was Frye?  I also thought he was supposed to be less of a liability than Love on the PnR so he might see more minutes.\n\nJust didn't make any sense to me (unless Frye is secretly hurt).|Warriors|1
i think that's what they were betting on to be honest...contain curry and hope for the best that the bench/klay/dray don't go off. i mean it's a pretty valid strategy to a degree, your bench usually never outscores an opponent's starters 45-10....||5
I'm pretty sure teams were trying to do this all season....if you don't have the depth, warriors other 4 players will destroy you. Klay and draymond are also all-pro, so good luck leaving one of them open ||2

Some people are asking for them, but the hate id get on a curry-Thompson lowlight reel when they won would be unreal. General rule is win=no lowlights |[NYK] Chris Copeland|255
I'm not sure I understand why?  Basketball is weird about winning.  You can't be Finals MVP is your time loses.  I found that out last year when LeBron was put in an ABSURD roster situation and put up performances that were genuinely mind blowing.  But Cavs lost so he can't be Finals MVP.\n\nAnd if your team wins but you individually are terrible you don't get a lowlights reel?\n\nA team loss doesn't invalidate an individual's exceptional achievement, and a team win doesn't make a poor performance anything but poor.\n\nI'm no Jordan fan because he's an asshole and a terrible human being.  But he won more than anyone else so he's the most famous player of all time.  Winning fixes everything I guess.  If you win nothing else matters at all.  If you lose nothing you did matters at all.\n\n...I vote you make the lowlight reel.  Hold poor performance accountable regardless of circumstance.||-10
You should still do one.\n\nI think Steph had the worst finals performance by an MVP in the history of the league just now... Considering he played poorly in the finals last year too, if he gets carried by his team that's going to have a lot of people feeling a certain type of way.|Magic|-37

No excuses this year if we lose.  But using big time injuries as an excuse is far from idiotic|Cavaliers|1
it is not an idiotic excuse even if Warriors win the series. Klay Thompson and Curry have talked about how much more confident they are going into this finals than last year's. \n\nThere are a lot of idiotic excuses but not having 2 of your 3 best players is not an idiotic excuse. Keep overreacting though. This sub would be flooded with excuses for the warriors if Klay and Green went down for the whole series and Cavs won and it would be a very valid excuse.|Supersonics|-20
It absolutely is idiotic, as Dubs proved tonight. Even with Curry and Klay ineffective as much as they were, the Cavs still ended up being handley beat, Kyrie and Love 100% healthy. So what would have changed from last year? You can argue that these teams are different now all you want but that would benefit Cavs moreso, because all of a sudden they now have more chemistry, cohesiveness, better bench, and their players have improved in their own ways as well (see, Delly, JR, TT) So any excuses acting like Dubs are the only side who have improved since last year's time while acting like the Cavs haven't is just stupid. |[NYK] J.R.

Cavs would have won 2 in a row if not for Irving and Love's injury. |Cavaliers|0
flair up|Supersonics|0
Same. People just assume that those two wins the Cavs eked out would have been in the bag, plus having Kyrie and Love would have put the Cavs over. \n\nThis totally ignores that Love and Kyrie were replaced with plus defenders getting more minutes. And because they were out, the Cavs were forced to play slower paced around Lebron--which is a key to negating GSW's transition game. \n\nThat shift in play style and the improvement on defense might not have happened if Kyrie and Love were on the floor.|Warriors|7
Oh really? You sound like an espn analyst. Always wrong.|Cavaliers|0
Because Kevin Love was a huge factor and Kyrie's defense is what saved the day? \n\nThanks for apparently going months back to refute people who had reasonable arguments with the same level of depth. Really shows how classy Cleveland fans can be.|Warriors|1
>Because Kevin Love was a huge factor and Kyrie\'s defense is what saved the day?\n\nI love how you just cherry picked their faults this series in an attempt to salvage your original argument that the Cavs were better off without them. The argument is as reasonable as saying the Warriors are better off with Barnes and bogut over Durant and Zaza, just because of some slight dropoff in defense. There\'s just nothing remotely reasonable about it, especially since you\'re not even taking into account fatigue, which Delly had to be hospitalized for.\n\nOh yeah, we\'re classless when your fanbase ruthlessly booed James and your entire team took to twitter and media to call lebron a baby. Thanks for that though, we definitely wouldn\'t have pulled it off without that motivation. LeBron\'s chuckle after hearing Klay\'s "I guess he got his feelings hurt" was the beginning of the end.|Cavaliers|1
Hmm. Despite your team winning the championship several weeks ago, you feel compelled to dig through for a month-old comment, and instead of giving valid counterpoints presenting your point of view, insulting me. Real, real classy.\n\nI'll admit to being outplayed in the last three games. I'm not ashamed to say that, because it's what happened. Despite Bogut being out, Draymond being suspended a game, Steph being less than 100%--you win or lose with who suits up in the Finals. Multiple Warriors didn't step up when it counted most, multiple Cavs did.\n\nBut for some reason, some--not all--Cavs fans will never admit that the Warriors beat you fair and square in 2015. You seem to fall into that camp, and, from what I can gather from your recent comments history, you have an ax to grind with the Warriors in particular. \n\nSo go ahead. Enjoy your win, enjoy shitting on other people's teams and players and fans if that makes you happy. I won't be able to change your mind, and you certainly won't be able to change mine.|Warriors|1
The Cavs beating the warriors was enough to suffice for a counterargument against your claim. Especially with all the talk about how LeBron only won because of Kyrie\'s shot. "Kyrie should have won finals MVP". Words spoken by people who all said the Cavs were better off without him last year. It\'s ridiculous how much people waver their opinions just to discredit LeBron.\n\nIn terms of officiating and rules, yeah the warriors won fair and square last year. We were just extremely shorthanded throughout the entire series, which opens up conversations about who would have won a healthy series. And here\'s a difference between cavs fans and warriors fans: We think we could have won if we were healthy. You guys think you could have won if the NBA "wasn\'t rigged."\n\nAnd you wanna talk about classy fanbases? [The pot calls the kettle black.](https://vine.co/v/eeBLtuY5LDP)\nI don\'t enjoy shitting on other teams unless they really asked for it, the way Golden State did. The amount of shit talking by their classless fans, the amount of whining about the games being rigged and the officiating biasing the Cavs was unbearable. Even the Warriors players and Stephs wife joined in on the classless insults at LeBron. If you think this kind of thing is common among all teams/fanbases, consider the Thunder. After they gave up a 3-1 lead, I didn\'t hear a peep about the league being rigged. Their fans didn\'t even boo draymond the way Oracle booed LeBron.\n\n\n\n|Cavaliers|1
Which is why every GSW fan openly begged for a healthy rematch. Even if we lost, at least people would stfu about last year.|Warriors|17
The awkward moment when you did lose... and no one shut the fuck up lol. We would have won 2 in a row against your whining ass fanbase|Cavaliers|2

Cavs were determined to not lose to Curry. And Warriors were determined to not lose to LeBron. One of their supporting cast did their jobs. |Warriors|41

Well, GSW's bench might also not be as red hot when that happens. But yeah, I doubt the Splash Bros have that rough a night again|Pacers|8
How big is the difference going to be when GS doesnt have 8 players in double figures?||234
Or when kyrie shoots above 33 percent & Jr Smith hits a few big 3s?\n\nIt was a bad game for the splash bros & pretty much the whole cavs team.. Steph & klay scoring 50 or so combined doesn't mean the cavs automatically can't win. |[NBA] Lebron James|1
Mozgov BIG|[GSW] Stephen Curry|1
With that bench they have the potential for that every night.|[GSW] Klay Thompson|1
So 9?|Warriors|1
Eh just take the 30-40 points that klay and steph usually score combined(on top of the 20 tonight) and that's what the other players picked up. Maybe if their whole team was cold where steph and klay combine for 20 and the rest do their usual and nothing more, then and only then you might have a point. ||2
more to do with cavs defence then how they play|Warriors|35
It's not like they were leaving them open. Most of them were reasonably well contested.|Cavaliers|3
Did you see the shots barbosa and Livingston hit? They played good D but those guys were on tonight. I think they come back down to earth game two but the splash bros will also be back to their old selves|76ers|9
Livingston has been hitting those shot all season. Small guards may as well be invisible to him.\n\nBarbosa seems like he usually makes crazy runners and misses open layups.|Warriors|12
He shot 80% this season?|Wizards|6
a lot of times yes. He'll come in for short spurts and hit 3 of 3 and then go back to the bench. happens a lot.\n\nHe's literally been their momentum shift machine when they've needed it.||7
Livingston is a giant of a point guard, it's on Ty Lue to switch someone capable of defending him.  You can't defend 6'7 with 6'2 and expect much shot contention.|[UTA] Rudy Gobert|5
I definitely think that Barbosa will come back down to Earth a bit in the next game, but Livingston makes those shots all day long. If Kyrie is defending him on those post ups, it's going to be BBQ chicken for him. |Spurs|15
To be fair, a lot of those shots were contested, barbosa and livingston just weren't missing anything. |Heat|7
Should balance out enough to not negate a 15 point differential. |Heat|120
No accounting for 40 LBJ points. |NBA|1
Curry and Klay average 51.9 this postseason, Barbosa and Livingston 12.8. If they go back to average, it balances out to +12.9, so they will be fine I guess.|Warriors|101
mmhmm|Heat|8
math.|Warriors|10
Are Love and Irving going to become elite defenders in 3 days?\n\n|Hornets|86
All that talk about Love on the PNR. Should have also mentioned Kyrie completely falling asleep on cuts and slashes to the basket |Warriors|2
I said all off season they wouldn't have made a difference because of their defense everyone laughed at me. Series is far from over but I'm confident |[GSW] Tim Hardaway|76
I made the case the other way. The best way for Cavs to compete is shorten the game, lessen the possesions. Play defensive lineups, crash the offensive boards. Krie, LBJ, JR, Shump and TT should play most minutes and JR and Shump have to hit 3s at a good clip. Otherwise no shot.||1
I was laughed at too when i suggested that the Cavs have to beat the Warriors defensively and not go and try to get into a shootout. You think that Kyrie and Love are going to impact this game defensively? Idk last year the Cavs were pretty good at doing that, but it might have been due to the fact that they had better defenders on the floor than Kyrie and Love.|[LAL] Nick Young|2
Nah man, Warriors only won a ring last year because of injuries. They could never beat the ~~Thunder~~...I mean ~~Cavaliers~~...I mean 1996-1997 Bulls if those teams were healthy. |Warriors|6
I mean, how is is not obvious?\n\nLeBron goes out and the Warriors bench go on a massive run with Love and Kyrie still in.\n\nThe Thunder were able to effectively switch and trap. The Cavs have shown ALL PLAYOFFS that they couldn\'t without LeBron.\n\nHell, I was watching the Toronto series watching them miss all of those wide open shots against the Cavs thinking "They\'re fucked against the Warriors. Even if Curry and Klay aren\'t on. You can\'t leave Green, Iggy, Barbose, and Livingston open like that"\n\n\n\n|Hornets|38
It's almost like the Warriors are much better than every team the Cavs have played|Warriors|65
Honestly think Portland would give Cleveland a good series.|Hornets|21
I mean, Portland is fun, but you're totally crazy.|Warriors|1
Lol stop. Blazers are 2...maybe 3 players deep. |76ers|6
It seemed like the cavs are about 2 or 3 as well last night.|[LAL] Kobe Bryant|3
You're right about that. But on an average day, they could be 7-9 man deep. LJ, Kyrie, Love, JR, Shump, TT, Frye, Delly, Jefferson. The problem is the Warriors are 10-man deep every game lol.|76ers|1

It's almost more annoying that the Thunder almost did it against the warriors because now people are acting like it's somehow not expected that the 73 win team will kick cleveland's ass, and that it's somehow an indictment on cleveland or the east. |NBA|-33

Undefeated in 49 States. Only California is his kryptonite. |76ers|7
Good thing he doesn't have to play there again!|Celtics|4
Can we overreact now?|[GSW] Jason Richardson|126
Lebron is taking his talents to South Beach again in the offseason, Kerr is going to break a clipboard every game the rest of the Finals, Livingston is going to be Finals MVP, Warriors in 2. |Spurs|2
Curry overrated. Getting carried to his second ring. Team would be just as successful without him. Am I doing it right?|Thunder|5
you forgot "Draymond Green is so dirty and flops so much"|[GSW] Jason Richardson|0
That doesn't really fit my man. That wouldn't be an overreaction from the particular game|Thunder|4
:(|[GSW] Jason Richardson|1
Yeah, plus it was fairly true during the WCF when people did say that after like every game|[NBA] Lebron James|2
Let's do it. Warriors in 3. |[GSW] Stephen Curry|5
You didn't start one minute after the game started? How dare you|Warriors|6
As soon as Love hit that first three I knew the Cavs would sweep|Bulls|3
I was overreacting once the anthem started tbh|[CLE] LeBron James|5
that anthem was john legendary|Warriors|3
I started since half-time.||49
Not overreacting, but with GSW's ability to come back from double digit deficits in the second half, them leading *going into the second half* was not a good sign for the Cavs.||4
http://imgur.com/VUJrPkg\n\nThe Cavs lost against the Warriors' *bench*. They should be very worried.|NBA|154
Id be more worried for Steph and Klay... The guys didn't show up and it wasn't because they were missing open shit. I mean they were, but we were smothering them and hence leaving their bench open. We thought we'd force their bench to step up and they fucking did. Much respect to them. Our plan backfired, and unfortuantely, Lue couldn't adjust.\n\nThat said, I'm doubtful That MJ decides to send his spirit into Livingston for the rest of the series. |Cavaliers|-3
And the Warriors lost to the cavs bench last year|Cavaliers|0
I felt bad for LeBron today||-2
They got smoked by the Warriors bench.\n\nThat was a normal Warriors bench game. The ought to be really fucking worried.||16
It's normal that Livingston gets 20 on 8-10, the bench has just 1 turnover, and they shoot 60%?|Cavaliers Bandwagon|6
Pretty much especially facing a porous defense||16
That's demonstrably false.||-1
Demonstrate it then.|Raptors|5
Well he shot 53% this year, pretty good, but a far cry from 8/10|Cavaliers|1
Look at there other games |Cavaliers|1
That wasn't normal. Livingston scoring 10 in a game is doing his job. Also, I don't think Mo hit a 3 that game|[GSW] Draymond Green|4
Livingston, Barbosa, and Iggy combining for 18-24 shooting. Yea..no. That's not normal.|76ers|12
yeah they played well but not like out of their mind. Steph and Klay still played about normal minutes and shot really poorly. That won't happen every night.|Lakers|11
The cavs bench combined for a GOATlike 10 points. That's not going to happen again.|Pistons|11
real question: you think delly + shumpert + frye + rjeff will combine for 20?|Lakers|26
I can see Frye doing better but the rest of them defer way too much to Bron, Kyrie whenever they're on the floor with either one of them|[NYK] J.R. Smith|2

Lebron put up 23-12-9 but for those who watched the game you could tell he had a bad game. It's crazy how much pressure he is under|Cavaliers|99
Had the same exact reaction. Towards the end they showed Lebron on the bench and I thought back on the game and said to myself, "man he just didn\'t step up tonight. Had a bad game". Immediately thereafter they flashed his stats. Thought, "wow, the fuck was I thinking?" He is just expected to play at such a high level that any mistakes you notice leave you feeling like he\'s playing poorly. ||2
A near triple double on 9/21. Sounds like Victor Oladipo type numbers.|[ORL] Mario Hezonja|4
It's 9-21.\n\nEdit: Why the heck did I get downvoted? The guy above initially said 9-27.||2
Those are mediocre numbers for Lebron, so much more is expected from him he's that kind of beast |Bulls|6
His efficiency was pretty bad though especially with all of the isos.|Warriors|10
In what world is that a bad game? Take away the tips he's shooting 55% with a near triple double. That's a *great* game. This game was won by our bench not lost by LeBron|Warriors|23

Who's we? Got a turd in your pocket?||8
That team just isn't good enough unless lebron goes crazy |76ers|11
They're a 7-seed without LeBron|Bulls|-1
The Cavs may not have even made the playoffs, the Pistons were pretty good for an 8th seed.|[WAS] Bradley Beal|0
Thanks for the love baby girl|[DET] Ben Wallace|2
And to think many people consistently say that without Stephen Curry the Warriors would be trash. I think that's what makes this team so good. The bench could honestly be a slightly below average 40 win team. Tack on a back to back mvp, a very good shooter in klay Thompson, and a ton of defensive prowess and you've got a very good team. |Warriors|7
If he played like Curry did they would have lost by 40. |Trail Blazers|52
Props to the refs though, they never really get any love other than getting shit on when they fuck up. They were pretty damn good tonight|Lakers|26
I don't have a streamable, but I distinctly remember a ref sprawling out in a super exaggerated flop haha|Timberwolves|1
They did a better job in the second half, but I felt they let way too much contact go under the Cavs basket and fell for a couple bad Warriors flops in the first half. |Cavaliers|2
Guys, I know how to avoid making bad calls, we'll just call nothing!|Celtics|3

Let's not count the Cavs out yet. It was only one game after all.|Raptors|1
That is the perfect illustration to why lebron counting stats are not very impressive or make a good argument.  \n\nGoes to show how low impact his stats are (that his fans love reciting). High usage, low efficiency, empty stats and a loss to bench squad (!) with plenty of excuses. \n\nIf you can't elevate your team of hand picked superstars to win against another teams bench, it's on you |Kings|14
Agree here. While he is one of the truly greats of the game, people have a hard time admitting that he clearly plays for his stats.|Lakers|0
What?  You don\'t like the "6 finals appearances"?  Lmao.  I\'m being generous with 4-1 GSW winning.  Somehow GSW lose 1.  \n\nEdit:  put Cavs winning.. typo. |Spurs|1
He had a triple double and lost to shaun Livingston and mo speights. Amazing how overrated box score counting stats are  |Kings|2
You can't defend every single player.  He goes out and this is what happens.  |Bulls|1
If he was a better scorer he could carry his team more |Kings|1
I'll be the first to admit I'm a HUGE Lebron hater but damn basketball is a 5 man game, he can't do it all. 7 finals in 10 years in the league is impressive. ||2
He has a superteam in the east. It's fair to expect more than 2 rings (by a lucky ray allen 3)|Kings|1
Agreed. But his fans still regurgitate the same "Lebron makes his teammates better" narrative. ||3

If we win next game I think we split in Cleveland and close it out at home in 5.  If not this is probably going to 7. |Warriors|23
Yep. Cleveland ain't winnin a game in Oracle. Just a matter of when not if as to who wins this series ||0
I remember everyone saying the same shit after game one when Kyrie went down last year.|[GSW] Draymond Green|0
even when cleveland got that lead, it never really felt like it was competitive. after OKC-Cavs, this series feels like a nice exhibition match out of respect to the JV conference. unless cavs are up 20 with <5 mins to go, warriors will always be in position to win the game|Lakers|2
You're probably right. ||2
- Warriors bench killing it, no surprise.\n- Cavs bench apparently doesn't exist, no surprise with that either.\n- LBJ one assist shy of the triple double.\n- Iggy wants that second finals MVP.\n- Irving was kinda trash despite the points.\n- Cavs gave up so many points in the paint.\n- Feels like Love missed ten layups.\n- Livingson with the match-up nightmare.\n- Don't think the Cavs can pull off the constant switching the Thunder did.|NBA|435
Cavs offense is so stagnant that it's really hard for role players to contribute or even get going. The 4th quarter was just Lebron dribbling the ball for the first 15 seconds and then getting a pick or just passing it away to some stagnant player who has to create his own shot. If the cavs even want a shot at this series, they need to change how they run their offense when they're behind.|Pistons|3
Love missed a few layups but he brought hustle and rebounding, this was all on the cavs bench. Also it was mostly just a factor of Cleveland saying we'll do whatever we can to stop curry and play from getting comfortable, good idea just not on a night where Livingston hits whatever he wants|Warriors|3
Igoudala was so huge this game... the back to back steals on Lebron in the second quarter were unreal.|Bulls|7
Draymond 3 assists away from triple double too. |Warriors|3
> Feels like Love missed ten layups.\n\nHe played terrible tonight. Sometimes, he just doesn't show up. It's strange for a player of his caliber.||4
15/12 aint that bad|Warriors|2
>no surprise with that either\n\nAnd that's how you can tell someone hasn't watched a lick of the 2016 playoffs|Cavaliers|183
Shhhhh let the hot takes come|Cavaliers|-2
Or he has and knows the east is weak AF.||1
Could go either way. Our bench has been killing it this whole season, slowed down in postseason though. |Warriors|1
I really don't think the cavs bench matches up well with the Warriors.  We'll see as the series goes on, but I don't think they will come up anywhere near this series as they have been the rest of he playoffs.|Warriors|1
Seriously. His tone sounds so pretentious and shortsighted.||2
Usually people with NBA flair don't know shit about the game.|NBA|2
You were surprised by the Cavs bench getting outplayed?|Nuggets|4
What?|Cavaliers|-2
\\*sips water\\*\n\n YOU WERE SURPRISED BY THE CAVS BENCH GETTING OUTPLAYED?||5
That's a dumb question, how could you infer that from my post|Cavaliers|0
You indicated that someone who says "Cavs bench is non-existent, not surprised by that either" hasn\'t watched much nba playoffs. So you clearly *were* surprised by that for some reason|Nuggets|5
Yeah and you asked if I was surprised that they got outplayed, which was not the original statement at all|Cavaliers|3
Ok let me rephrase. Are you surprised the Cavs bench is non-existent?|Nuggets|5
Yes because they have played extremely well all playoffs|Cavaliers|3
Cavs had it easy in the East. Now they're gonna see some real adversity and they'll be squeezed for the cakewalk they got with ECF.|Mavericks|6
Your bench has been less than stellar against weak competition ||8
That's not true at all|Cavaliers|-4
Forreal dude. Frye is a bad matchup against the warriors and he's the biggest punch of the bench. JR is definitely not gonna repeat this performance too. It's gonna be a tough series |Warriors|18
We kept saying that about JR during last year's finals :(|Cavaliers|4
Pretty sure people have been saying that about JR his whole career. |Lakers|4
or he's saying the east competition isnt comparable|Warriors|58
Bench is averaging barely over 20 points a game (compared to the Warriors at just under 30) last series. They are an inconsistent group and (like last years playoffs) it isn't surprising they are getting handled during those rotations.\n\nOne great game by Frye doesn't negate the fact that they are usually scraping by to find double figures from someone from the bench.|NBA|10
Just ignoring that the bench lineup with LeBron had the best Net Rating in the NBA going into this series|Cavaliers|0
Everyone understands that. But those numbers  acquired against the Pistons, Hawks, and Raptors aren't a good representation of what might happen against GS.|Raptors|2
Still need points, and your bench does not provide that on a consistent basis. \n\nThere is not one single consistent scorer coming off your bench.|NBA|12
Who does Frye guard in this series? |Kings|15
Same person he guards any series|[GSW] Calbert Cheaney|2
Hide him on Barnes I guess|Warriors Bandwagon|2
Barnes will get points like he did tonight.||9
Put him on Livingston. Put some height on him as he just toyed his defenders with that length.|Heat|3
Yep the X factor Channing Frye would've dominated this game if Lue had played him.|Warriors|170
Lou gonna have a tough time playing Frye, absolute liability defensively. He could go off though, still think it plays into the warriors hands overall.|[GSW] Calbert Cheaney|4
Feel like I'm missing some /s here|76ers|15
Have you also not been watching the playoffs? Frye has one of the better FG% of all time and he's been doing it off J's||-5
which is probably unlikely to continue. Especially against a defense like the warriros.\n\nBut the main reason he didnt play much is because hes too slow to defend against this team|76ers|9
He is being sarcastic.  But he's also wrong.  The dude really didn't watch any of the Cavs playoff games if he says it's no surprise the bench didn't show up.  |[MIA] Mario Chalmers|-1
I like Frye, but he would really really struggle to defend against the Warriors |76ers|23
When a guy shoots ~50 percent from 3 for the playoffs & your offense isn't really clicking like usual, it might be worth giving him a few more minutes to try & spark a run |[NBA] Lebron James|-5
Not saying he shouldn't get time when you're playing bad, but it's unlikely he'd really succeed. He can't really defend against the Warriors, he's very slow of foot, and he also likely won't continue shooting over 50%. It's pretty hard to keep that up regardless of who you're playing, and the Warriors would make it harder than other teams did |76ers|12
I guess, but it looked like lebron was in pass mode a good portion of the night, so I could see him getting a few good looks. Idk it probably wouldn't have made enough of a difference either way. \n\nSpeaking of lineup choices though, the lineup to start the 4th from ty lue for sure should've been different. |[NBA] Lebron James|-3
Didnt see much to say that. He'd at least be a threat in offense.|Cavaliers|1
They didn't get near the uncontested 3s that they did in the east. Frye is useless if he can't get those ||10
he was drilling contested 3s as well... have you watched the playoffs?|Cavaliers|-5
I agree 100%. If that\'s what the commenter meant though he should\'ve mentioned Frye.  Not "Cavs bench didn\'t show up,  not surprisingly." could\'ve been worded better IMO|[MIA] Mario Chalmers|3
Why? He's been absolutely on fire from 3||3
He can't defend against this team |76ers|20
Very true. ||5
They were exploiting the shit out of Kyrie on defense.  When they had livingston running point there was a span where they attacked him 3 times or something in a row. He just is a matchup nightmare against that lineup.|Pistons|8
That's the problem with Kyrie being healthy, if he's not producing on offense, he becomes a major liability on defense, which Delly never was, and Delly still contributed somewhat on offense with his efficient 3 ball.  |Warriors|12
You never see this on the stats either.  Lack of defense can produce a lot of losses, even if there is a lot of offense from the given player (ahem Harden)|Pistons|9
Specifically Livingston, there's a 4 inch difference between them, he has no way to contest the midrange jumper|Warriors|7
> LBJ one assist shy of a triple double.\n\nAt this point I'm starting to question if he does this intentionally to fuck with us.||9
Yeah right. He wants them stats|Lakers|3
JR couldn't have been any more shit if the warriors were paying him to tank in hookers and drugs|Raptors|13
He could've missed the one basket he made ||1
Yesterday this was the deepest team Lebron's ever had. Today, Lebron needs help.|Heat|23

You might be able to honestly|Heat|2
I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to diminish the win by the warriors because they played very well, but I\xe2\x80\x99ll be damned if you can show me two minutes out of the 30+ that JR played where he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t walking. When you see most of the Cavs trying so hard to win and notice JR literally walking on defense and standing completely still on offense it\xe2\x80\x99s infuriating.||68
He needs to be making shots and getting touches if you want him to play hard on defense.||1
Maybe he got lost?|Bucks|1
It was strange to see for sure. I think him getting a floor burn on his hand threw him off early. It definitely affects you mentally a bit. That plus the fact that he wasn't getting the ball in good spots didn't help either|Cavaliers|2
Thank god the Knicks got rid of him. It was worth it to lose Shumpert to be rid of JR. |[NYK] Charles Oakley|3
Glad we got rid of them too. Shumpert is pretty much invisible, but at least he tries hard on defense. Neither of them are Finals type players that can keep up with the best in the NBA.|Knicks|4
That should tell you more about the Cavs and the Eastern Conference.|Warriors|78
Hey don't blame the whole conference because one player was lazy.|[MIA] Dwyane Wade|1
You just extrapolated JR smith's laziness in one game to 15 teams. Unreal logic.|[CHI] Jimmy Butler|9
Well I meant the fact that jr as a key player on the best team in the east can get to the finals as easily as they did tells you about the level of competition. |Warriors|10
Pretty impressive skills.|Thunder|7
Because the playoffs are so long it's just been a really long time since the Cavs actually played a strong opponent. You have to go back to like early or mid-March or maybe even February to find a game where the Cavs actually faced a legitimately tough opponent. ||2
It tells me you didn't watch them. JR was all hustle and effort the entire playoffs until tonight. |Trail Blazers|7
That should tell you more about JR smith lol|Knicks|17
Amen brother|[NYK] Charles Oakley|3
warriors defense made a lot of that happen. they played them hard as fuck on D.||12
JR walks a fine line between being too high and not high enough. I'm not sure what he was tonight. Regardless, he wasn't the right amount of high.|Spurs|18
Nor was Klay, for that matter.|Warriors|11
A few thoughts:\n\n1. To lose a game where Curry and Thompson played their worst game of the season is probably fatal to Cleveland.\n\n2. The Cavs will probably shoot better in the restricted area, but the offense is going to continue to be way too dependent on iso scoring if the W's keep switching everything.\n\n3. The Warriors have played absolutely no cards. Traditional lineup, long rotation, etc. It's not like they poured everything into this one.\n\n4. The Cavs now either need to beat a 73 win team 4 out of 5 games, or win a game 7 at Oracle. Good luck with that.\n\nI just don't see it. I feel like analysts are grasping at straws trying to come up with why the Cavs can get back in this series. OKC was better than Cleveland. That was obvious then, and its obvious now.\n\nWarriors in 5. |Bulls|26
God this is gonna suck. I wanna talk shit about Cleveland this series but it's not worth it.  It's such a shitty place to live, making jokes is like stealing candy from an aborted fetus||34
With no regard for human life!|Lakers|3
You could tell the defensive intensity was completely different this series to the WCF, so much space for everyone on the Warriors, whereas the Warriors struggled a lot more against the length and speed of the OKC backcourt. Unless Cavs defense can get to that swarming level, I'm not sure it will be a close series.  |Pacers|7
Exactly, I laugh at all the Cavs fans that think they had any shot at defending them. Curry and Thompson sucked with space tonight. Imagine what they'll do when they actually take advantage of it. \n\nCavs sacrificed their D for O when they traded for Frye. This just makes them even more vulnerable. |Warriors|4
Honestly this was the perfect opportunity to steal game 1 for the Cavs. Especially with the way Thompson and Curry were shooting, and in the third when they kept switching leads the chance to take a lead was there.\n\nWhat a shame, wasted opportunity \n\nCredit to Livingston and Iggy, good game from both those guys|Raptors|31
Having a weak east is bad for the nba.|Lakers|22
If (when) the Cavs lose this series there's going to be this debate about whether LeBron being 2-5 in the Finals is some indicator that he's overrated or whatever, and I say to that that stat is not about how good or bad he is, but about how bad the East has been. Being 2-5 in the Finals doesn't mean LeBron is below other all time greats, just like going to 6 straight NBA Finals doesn't mean he's on another level than other all time greats. It just means he has been one of the top 2 players in the league for a long time during an extended stretch where virtually every great team in the league other than the one he's on has been in the other conference.  As such he's been able to essentially cruise to the Finals year after year against inferior competition only to lose in the Finals once finally facing a great team. \n\nYou have to ask yourself if LeBron's Cavs and Heat teams had been in the West this whole time, how many times would LeBron have even made the Finals? I say three times, max. So instead LeBron might be 2-0 or even 3-0 in the Finals, but if he'd only been 2-0 in the Finals instead of 2-5, would never having lost in the Finals but only having gone twice have changed how good he is? I don't think so. ||4

[Warriors bench like](https://imgflip.com/i/157nwj)\n\nWith JR not getting his first points until late in the 4th quarter and ~~Kevin Love basically not showing up tonight~~ (SEE EDIT), along with the Warriors bench putting up 35pts VS the 10pts from the Cavs bench and not to mention Curry and Klay not ~~exactly~~ hot, it\'s going to be tough for the Cavs to get W\'s without some serious adjustments and for their guys to step it up a notch. Warriors bench came through in stellar fashion tonight, absolutely fantastic bench players; the Cavs bench needs to step it up in the next game\n\nAlso I have no clue why so many people are saying, "LOL And this Cavs team is supposed to be better than lasts years" etc etc --\n\nYa\'ll forgetting that this Warriors team is much better than last years Warriors team, it\'s not like they are playing at the exact same level they were last year, this team improved a lot since last year.\n\nCavs still managed to keep it closer than I expected despite everything up until the end there, should still be a great series considering the Thunder lost by, what, 26pts I believe in Game 2**. I am looking forward to Game 2 to see how both teams respond, HYPE!\n\nTL;DR - Warriors bench got that dad dick, Cavs guys need to step the fuck up, JR, Love AND the Cavs bench can\'t ghost in this serious and expect any W\'s\n\nedit: As some of you pointed out, Kevin Love did show up tonight, I was just expecting a little more from him through all 4 quarters, he seemed to dissappear for several minutes at a time when they needed him most and I feel his statline looked better than his play; doesn\'t help that JR forgot he was playing tonight so maybe that made Love feel needed more than he should have especially putting up 17\n\nAlso Warriors bench put up 35 tonight VS  10 from the Cavs bench; they are going to have to step it up aswell|Wizards|249
Kinda looks like Livingston....|[GSW] Chris Mullin|2
I think Love did okay compared to some of his games this postseason. He scored 17 points on 7-17 FG. That\'s not that bad in my eyes really. Besides the stat sheet, sure he definitely did some questionable stuff.\n\nI agree with everything else, and not only are the Warriors better than last year, but Cleveland\'s own Timofey "Steven Adams" Mozgov from last years finals isn\'t going to play a single minute this series. The Thunder played so well against the Warriors because they had big size and length.|Knicks|2
I felt that Love did not show up when he needed to, seemed he would disappear for several minutes at a time and was a total nonfactor when they needed him in general tonight.\n\n>not only are the Warriors better than last year, but Cleveland\'s own Timofey "Steven Adams" Mozgov from last years finals isn\'t going to play a single minute this series. The Thunder played so well against the Warriors because they had big size and length.\n\nAbsolutely true|Wizards|1
Warriors bench scored 45, not 35.||3
I also thought that Love didn't really show up tonight. Lots of missed lay ups and really looked tired throughout the game.||3
Cavs do not have the length to keep up like the Thundies did. Can't prevent them from playing team basketball.|Thunder|3
The Thunder won game 1 in their series against the Warriors. They lost game 2 badly.|Mavericks|3

I thought Love was fine besides a few easy misses. How did he not show up?|Cavaliers|6
Dude put up like 15 and 10 in the first half alone. I'd say he showed up. |Pistons|2
Yeah everybody forgets that the Warriors got stage fright during the first few games of the Finals. They ain't nervous anymore. |Celtics|40
Curry and Klay seemed kind of nervous|Cavaliers Bandwagon|1
Nah, that was just low intensity Steph and Klay.|Warriors|6
Nah they just missed shots. Wouldn't pin it down to nervousness. |Celtics|8
Steph and Klay sure look like they are|Warriors|2
Livington's mid-range is on a whole other level...he had a hand in face on nearly all his shots, and he was still lights out. Just an absolutely matchup nightmare for traditional point guards and even against bigger guys like Shumpert or JR. He was really only stifled when LeBron was guarding him, but even that creates mismatches for his teammates (I recall Kyrie having to guard Barnes in a lot of these situations).||25
Their hands were literally in his face, they couldn't reach the ball. It's insane how much higher he gets than the other PGs|Warriors|2
Every time he goes up for a jumper I hold my breath until he has landed and is safely running back down the court with both knees intact.||3
Yeah LeBron can slow down pretty much anybody on the Warriors but unfortunately for the Cavs they only have one LeBron. It's a shame he can't be at multiple places at once.|[NBA] LeBron James|13
> but unfortunately for the Cavs they only have one LeBron.\n\nYes. Quite unfortunate. |Lakers|3
That's pretty unfair to Kevin Love in my opinion|Supersonics|86
[deleted]||-4
They were already trying to force him too much. He got the ball in the post way too much. It lead to some bad shots and some turnovers. I think they need to move it around more, and stop giving over whole possessions to Kyrie and Love to do what they want with.|Rockets|2
Yeah, I agree with that|Supersonics|4
I think he did well on offensive but I also feel like he plays a bit soft. I don't think I saw him get angry and dunk on somebody. or dunk when he has the opportunity to. He missed a bunch of crucial layups, just like Lebron.|Clippers|2
Kevin love not showing up? Did we watch the same game? |Bulls|174
Was about to say this exact thing, last time i checked he had 15 pts and 12 boards(i think at the half, i havent looked at the final box score so feel free to correct me on it). He did much better than i expected, lets see how long that lasts|Bulls|0
Yeah, he wasn't that bad. I thought at times he was better than Irving who scored but played trash defense and isolated all the time.|Celtics|3
and irving couldn't hit a jumper to save his life.||0
Kevin played great. This guy is crazy. Our 4-10 men need to not suck dick|Cavaliers|4
He was good just couldn't buy a layup|[WAS] John Wall|3
For the most part offensively, yes. But idk why it seems like Love plays soft both on defense and second chance points. How many layups did he miss? and driving at him is like for sure scoring. |Clippers|3
He didn't get a triple double so he's a scrub obviously |Cavaliers Bandwagon|9
Kevin Love had a great game. The guy has blinders on.|Cavaliers|19
That line confused the shit out of me. It felt like he did whatever he wanted.|Warriors|25
He also bricked a shot off the side of the backboard, so|Warriors|3
including fucking up multiple times. truly did it all|Timberwolves|3
I swear yall gave him the Andre Roberson treatment on several plays, he was wide open on the baseline shot way too much.|Thunder|5
Eh he missed some gimmes and wasn't as effective in the post as you would hope but he had a solid game offensively. He's so good on the glass, I feel like his impact there is underrated because a lot of what he does on the boards is subtle unlike a Deandre Jordan or Andre Drummond |Knicks|7
Draymond had the best statline for the Warriors tonight: 2nd in scoring, lead the team in rebounds/assists/steals\n\n|Warriors|8
Finals MVP so far IMO |Warriors|3
Your opinion is wrong unless you missed the game and only caught the box score. |Cavaliers|-1
Without Mozgov in there, he's having his way.||5

not over yet |Nets|6
It is according to /r/nba|Cavaliers|1
Anyone else kinda disappointed that this felt more like a regular season game than a Finals game? A few notables--the Delly nut shot on Iggy/Iggy staredown, Kerr breaking a clip board, the Cavs comeback in the 3rd. But overall it seemed low energy (awful crowd for Oracle) and unremarkable.|Warriors|36
I was disappointed with how sloppy it was. It's like there was a 50/50 shot of whoever had the ball tripping over himself or throwing some shit pass. ||0
Well, when courtside tickets set you back $37,000 not sure what type of crowd you're going to get.|[GSW] Draymond Green|3
Cavs didn't look like they were really into it besides Lebron really. It's like everyone has PTSD from last season.|[OKC] Russell Westbrook|2
The WCF is the series that matters most, the actual Finals is just a formality.|Spurs|16
Agreed. R\\nba has been saying this since the regular season. No reason for it to change now|Heat|3

Tough call\xe2\x80\xa6 but I still stand by my early prediction that the Cavs would be lucky to get to 6 games. \n\nEdit:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/4lta59/early_predictions_for_warriorscavaliers/d3q0eh8||133
Lol|[CLE] Kyrie Irving|1
My friend said it either be a Warrior sweep or Warriors in 5 at the least but I called bullshit. The bench winning this game for GS got me worried. When Klay and Curry start hitting it's going to be GG. It's just Game 1 but this game the Cavs should have won. Splash bros cold you gotta win.|[OKC] Russell Westbrook|1
Lol at the guy who replied to you saying Cavs in 5|[NYK] J.R. Smith|1
Shouldn't that be expected though? This team won 73 games. I don't see how they aren't favorited to win in 4-5, and don't see how it's bad on the Cavs if they lose. It's what should be expected.|NBA|1
Still to tough to call, but Bucks in 6 still has a nice ring to it |[MIA] Dwyane Wade|3
fuck the bucks. fuck the bucks.\n\nOh lord I just noticed they have the worst team name in the nba...||1
ill take it|Bucks|3
I think calling anyone of the two teams in less than 6 is crazy. But, at the risk of sounding like a homer myself, I think the guy who responded to you saying the Cavs would win in 5 is even crazier. That would require winning at least 2/3 at Oracle, that would be insanely unpredictable. |Pistons|2
I'm in a agreement with you. We'll know how competitive this series will be in a couple of games.|Rockets|2
Well you might be right...but you were wrong about the Curry part haha|Heat|2

I think the Cavaliers will take maybe 1-2 games in Cleveland, but when you lose by 15 and Curry/Klay COMBINE for 20 points, your odds don't look too great right now.|Heat|42
Cavs will be lucky to win 1 game. People forget the Warriors won 73 FUCKING GAMES this season. |[NYK] Charles Oakley|0
Havent they lost atleast 1 game in each series? I predict the same, Cavs get atleast 1 but no more than 2.|Heat|2
I mean, their bench went off. No much you can do about that. Wont happen every night. |Hornets|6
Neither will Steph and Klay combine for 20. ||8
Neither will the GSW have 6 people score more than them. It's a trade off. \n\nI'm not discounting them they played well. |Hornets|2
I totally agree with you. I guess I always think it's somewhat silly to extrapolate 'what-ifs'. There are a thousand 'what-ifs' a game. \n\nIt kind of reminds me of a cool article I read a year or two ago on this subreddit, where before the lottery selections were picked, someone wrote a conspiracy theory for every bottom 8 team of why they received the number 1 pick. \n\nThere is a narrative for every situation/||5

Obviously you don't know his record during lunar equinox.||1
Cavs need to quit worrying about taking advantage of the switches and just play team oriented offenses.  The Warriors know it's coming and just swarm the ball.\n\nCavs also need to make their damn open layups, missed at least 10-15 gimmes tonight.|Kings|7
Warriors are undefeated when Kerr breaks a whiteboard|Warriors|6
Every...Fucking...Game..YES YES YES YES YES|Heat|7
This was must-have for Cavs. Big 3 playing well and Thompson/Curry totally off. yet they lost||8
Barbosa outscored the Cavs bench by himself. |Rockets|7
Which is an anomaly. Cavs have shooters, who need to show up as soon as fucking possible. Rotations were thrown off as soon as they were playing catch up.|Cavaliers|3
Lue didn't do a great job managing his rotations at the end. No reason to have LeBron sit and watch as the Warriors rattles of 15 straight. Game was over at that point.\n\nI understand that James needs a breather but sitting him all that time, even after that ~5 minute review stoppage, is baffling to me. |[WAS] Etan Thomas|7
Strange. Maybe he was resting him because for some unknown reason he was sacrificing this game?\n\nI think it's more baffling how many minutes Smith got given his actual production. Maybe because he's the kick-out option for LBJ/Kyrie ISOs, but if that shit's not working, it's time for a change.|Kings|1
Much like game 7 of WCF, it was extremely enjoyable to see all the haters losing their shit as the game went on.\n\nI absolutely love it when people let too much salt into their brains and completely lost their minds.||7
I find it odd that everyone is focusing on the splash bros. bad shooting night.  It was a product of the Cavs throwing 2 or 3 bodies at them (especially steph) at all times leaving everyone else with easy looks all game.  |Grizzlies|8
That's going to lead to open looks from other players occasionally but honestly, the bench players for GS were sinking contested shots too. Barnes went off in the 1st half, then Livingston in the 2nd.||1
They put 2-3 guys on screens on him. But they also missed plenty of good looks. |Warriors|3
Indeed.  I was more trying to say it shouldn't be surprising that everyone else did so well when the Cavs let them get SO many easy looks|Grizzlies|3
Gotcha, I wasn't sure if you were trying to make an excuse and think that the Warriors were a fluke for winning tonight like I've heard some already.\n\nI think Golden State just matches up too well against Cleveland. Cleveland is too small and doesn't play good enough defense. Only LeBron can guard anybody. |Warriors|3
It seems like Cleveland's essential problem is that their second and third best players are both defensive liabilities. With Love, it isn't that big of a deal, because they can put Channing Frye in. The Cavs need Kyrie to be playing lights-out to have a shot at winning, and right now, Golden State is just abusing him on defense. |Pistons|1
Frye might be the worse defender of the two. He's easily the better value, tho. Love will be traded. |Warriors|1
We forget that Golden State's key bench players were starters at one point in their careers. Insane performance from the bench.|Warriors|6
Flops, High Leg Kicks, Attempted ball murders, a near fight, a dive into a fan... this game had it all. \n\nLebron was WAY TOO passive though.|Lakers|8
I don't know why people expect Lebron to be super aggressive. This is his game. The games where he put up a tonne of shots are the exception. |76ers|2

Not to project a series based on one game, but as someone with no dog in this fight, I will be whole-heartedly rooting for the Warriors and a Shaun Livingston Finals MVP. That dudes been through so much and it would be the perfect feel good story. |[CHI] Jimmy Butler|6
If I could vote for him I would!|Heat|1
At least they contained Curry and Klay, no?\n\nNo, that won't work. Warriors simply have too many weapons to fire. Cavs' role players had it rough tonight. Hope they can bounce back and make this series competitive before the Splash bros figure out (very soon) how to make a come back.|Spurs|6
Or perhaps Cavs bench needs to step up to keep it tight. Some better defense by Love and Irving could go a long way too. |Clippers|1
Warriors have seven players in double-digit scoring and Klay isn't one of them.\n\nJ.R. Smith with three points, one assist, one rebound, one block, and one turnover in 36 minutes.|Bulls|5
There was nobody on the Thunder that completely lapsed on D the way JR Smith can at seemingly any point in the game. It can really break the Cavs backs sometimes. Speaking of D, I saw at least 4 wide open dunks this game for the Warriors on missed reads/no switching while I think I saw just 1 in all 7 games of the Thunder/Warriors series.\n\nFeels like it's easier for the other Warriors players to score because Cleveland just doesn't have the size and length that a lot of the Thunder players had. Looks to me like a Vegeta in the gravity chamber situation.|Knicks|5
I love Shaun Livingston|[TOR] Jonas Valanciunas|6
The Cavs didn't seem to have the fire they played with against the Raptors. \nOverall, as a neutral fan I found this game a bit boring. Crowd wasn't into it at much either. It actually didn't seem like a playoff game but more regular season? Damn, we got spoiled by the OKC-GSW WCF. |Raptors|5
Cavs focused SOO much on Steph and Thompson allowed for the bench guys to get a lot of quality points.\n\nI don't think Lue thought much about how to contain Livingston (and Barbossa), and the Warriors exploited that badly.\n\nAnd the Cavs hadn't seen this good of a defense and weren't quite ready for the intensity.\n\nKyrie is a weird player. Shoots a ton, scores a lot, plays AWFUL defense, and doesn't seem very efficient in any of it.|Heat|6
Definitely agree. They underestimated the bench players. That and the free lay ups were the main problems I saw. ||1
Pick your poison.  |Warriors|2
Holy crap.  Splash Bros combine for just 20 and GS still wins by 15 and controlled pretty much throughout.  This could be over quickly if Cleveland doesn't pull it together, and fast.  Having Kyrie and Love healthy doesn't help a lot when the bench does jack squat.|Hawks|6
There is a chance the Cavs were rusty. Let's wait and see what game 2 looks like. ||0
Have any evidence of the Cavs just missing open 3s? Seems like they had very little open looks.\n\nWere actually bailed out a lot at the FT line and by Steph and Klay missing makable shots. |Bulls|0
Have any evidence of the Cavs just missing open 3s? Seems like they had very little open looks.\n\nWere actually bailed out a lot at the FT line and by Steph and Klay missing makable shots. |Bulls|1

This flopping bullshit needs to stop its an embarrasment|Bulls|7
If every game was called like game 7 of the WCF, there would be no more flopping. |Lakers|6
And the Thunder are like "How come we didn\'t play against THIS Klay and THIS Curry tonight?"\n\nI guarantee you the Thunder would win by 30 if Klay/Steph combine for only 20. They\'d shut everyone else down.\n\nSeriously, it\'s just Livingston. It\'s Barbosa getting his, Bogut getting double figures, Barnes finally woke up.\n\nIf the Cavs can\'t beat the W\'s when the Splash Bros. only get 20, they may not win a game this series.||7
The bench was wide open because we locked down on klay and steph.  ||2
Thanks, Magic Johnson|[GSW] Latrell Sprewell|3
Cleveland so worried about the Steph they leaving somebody open every play practically.|Raptors|7
What I don't get is when it was a one point game in the third Lue went with this lineup: James, TT, Shump, JR(ghost), Delly. Where the fuck will you get scoring from this lineup?!?|Cavaliers|5
He was doing some experimental shit.  It didn't work out, obviously.|Cavaliers|2
It's gonna be another tough series for LeBron's back. |Knicks|6
So Shaun Livingston this year's Final's MVP||7
Cavs tried to play some aggressive defense on Curry which worked but once he passed it out the Cavs didn't communicate on their switches and always led to easy dunks for GSW. \n\nThis makes me appreciate the OKC defense more because they worked as a unit on defense (offense an entire different story) and even though they were scrambling and switching everywhere people found a man and stuck to them.\n\nThat being said, Cavs are going to be lucky if they can even win 2 games in this series if they play like they did tonight. Splash bros played shitty. They gotta try something new like move Kyrie to the bench or just start Lebron at center or SOMETHING because I see the same outcomes for the rest of the series.|Jazz|6
I wonder if any other superstars are realizing that coaching matters? Clearly KD and Westbrook learned. |Celtics|1
> Cavs tried to play some aggressive defense on Curry which worked but once he passed it out the Cavs didn't communicate on their switches and always led to easy dunks for GSW. \n\nWhat?  Every GSW run was with Curry on the bench; it was the 80% shooting on contest ed shots from the bench with both splash brothers sittign that was the difference.  That's not a 'fundamental' problem with the Cavgs; that's just a few players being Lights Out and no one on the Cavs able to get into that extra gear to match.||1
they shot "lights out" because they had very easy looks from poor defense. Is there anyone on the Cavs that can guard Iggy, Barnes, or Livingston other than Lebron? Seriously |Bulls|1
I was replying to the 'Curry caused it by drawing attention!' comment. Curry only caused the poor D on livingston if the Cavs were too busy watching him sitting on the bench to play D.||1
I wonder if the cavs can get past game 5 in oracle too, obviously if they can win both home games, but I feel it'll be tough for them.||1
The Eastern Conference is so weak that their best team gets taken out by the bench players of the West.||5
Unfortunately for the Cavs, the Warriors without Curry and Klay are still probably good for the 4 seed in the East.|Warriors|20
no way. the bench got so many points off of curry/klay off ball cuts|West|2

A lot of lazy "The Cavs will adjust" analysis.\n\nThe Cavs are the inferior team and are overmatched. We need to stop pretending these teams were *even* before the series began. Just because you want a good matchup doesn\'t mean it exists.\n\nThe bottom line is Curry and Klay were trash and this game wasn\'t close. Not a good omen. At all. |Bulls|10
How do you adjust to they have 7 guys that can run pass and shoot and we have 3 maybe 4?\n\nUntil the Cavs can come up with an answer to that I cannot see them winning the series. They may win a couple of games but this is the problem that is the difference in the series.||2
When you have to play against toronto as opposed to okc, the cavs were bound to get a little shocked by the level of gameplay. Im sure this will allow them to prepare better for game 2 now that they know it's not the East theyre playing against. |Hawks|1
Pretty sure they knew they weren't playing the East when this game started. They are a great team and we would be amiss to say this series is doomed. That being said, I just don't know what they can do differently.  |Warriors|1
If the Cavs can't win a game when Curry and Thompson combine for 20 points, they're fucked||12

Exactly. |Hawks|1
First comment I've read where I didn't lose brain cells it seems.|Cavaliers|3
Calls me nuts but I think Ty Lue should bench Kyrie and Love. At this point, they're holes defensively and should be replaced by Delly and someone according to how big or small they decide to play. \n\nKyrie and Love need to either really step up their D or swallow their pride and sit on the bench. It's about who gets the stops now. |Lakers|4
Your nuts.\n\nIn all seriousness, I dont think they should be benched. I think maybe their minutes should be staggered, perhaps. \n\nBut, honestly I think their issues are all related to the cross-matches they tried to engineer and the ones they tried to stop.\n\nOn Defense, they were so worried about the Curry/Green PnR that LBJ kept trying to lock down SC. That comprimised the rest of their D and let the "others" get easy looks. \n\nOn Offense, too much focus on trying to post up. It slowed the game down, allowed GSW to set their D, and reduced their ability to get Offensive rebounds. |Lakers|2
Fair enough. This is essentially a game of chess in the form of switches between Ty Lue and Steve Kerr - who completely steamrolled Ty Lue in the last quarter. \n\nThis is definitely not how the rest of the series is going to pan out, because Steph and Klay aren't going to have an off night as bad as last night. \n\nI say Warriors in 5|Lakers|2
Funny, because weren\'t Cavs fans original argument "WE WILL HAVE HEALTHY IRVING AND LOVE THIS TIME, CAVS WILL SWEEP" |Warriors|13
Except their performance last playoffs was better than this game so.... ||-1
Might be because they didn't play any team like the Warriors yet. |Warriors|4
damn GS Fans are assholes. ||-8
Cav fans were assholes in the beginning for making ridiculous statements about our championship last year. |Warriors|1
You played your first starting point guard on an above average team in 7  playoff rounds in this years WCF; and then claimed there was no good fortune or luck involved.   That's just ignoring the facts.  You hit the first actual decent playoff team and you start 1-3; looking horrible. Kudos on pulling that out; but show some humility in winning.  A 28y/o with bad knees and ankles is your 'GOAT'; you've been fortunate.  Appreciate it while it lasts.||-2
That really doesn't have anything to do with what I said. \n\nCav fans started it, we're gonna finish it. |Warriors|3
That's the response of a toddler (Well, or trump)||-2
Any fans of any sort tend to be assholes in the playoffs...\n\nIf they aren't assholes they aren't being very vocal then.||2
Look out for pissed-off Curry and Klay for game 2. No way in hell they shit the bed two games in a row. Will be a statement game from them.|Warriors|4
Klay has shat the bed for multiple games before|Rockets|3
The Cavaliers ran their offensive gameplan to perfection and found life is a lot more difficult when you don't have space to breathe at the 3 point line\n\nThey proceeded to run isos the rest of the game|Lakers|5
I'm just here to make a sweeping statement:\n\n\n\nWARRIORS IN 4|Bulls|5
i wish|West|3
SWEEP||4
Will the Warriors bench play nearly perfect the rest of the series? Probably not.\n\nBut will Steph and Klay play this poorly the rest of the series? Probably not.\n\nCavs need to find an answer to Warriors fast, otherwise this series will be over a lot sooner than they would like.|[LAL] Kobe Bryant|9
The good thing for the Warriors is this is going to scare the cavs into game planning for the rest of the team, making it easier for curry and Thompson |Thunder|4
Might as well replay the WCF instead of this trash|Lakers|11

LeBron came in and and was an assist shy of a triple double, and all I'm seeing online are people blasting him for not caring.\n\nSteph forgot the game was happening tonight, and all I see is people talking about that late three he had when the Warriors were already up by double figures.|76ers|74
**LEBRON NEEDS MORE HELP**||1
Too stat focused - we know who LeBron is and how good he is. He didn't play very well this game||1
Idk just came from the game and everybody is pretty aware that Steph and Clay were cold tonight. Dubs are funny like that.|Warriors|1
But but *spacing*!!!|Bucks|1
Curry had a game with a triple double and people shit on him too. That's just haters man. You get that high up and the hate just flows. |Warriors|1
All you see is people talking about his 3? Really? Where? All I see is that the bench carried them. Complaining about nothing. ||1
That's not what I'm seeing in this thread at all.|[CHI] Michael Jordan|1
This was mostly based on shit I saw on twitter towards the end of the game, not on this gamethread|76ers|1
Ah ok fair enough.|[CHI] Michael Jordan|1
They couldve still made a run at that point though\n\nEdit:ignore my comment, fully misread what you said|Bulls|1
His dumbass jumper at the top of the key right when we were on a run fucked our momentum, and all those damn turnovers. He still played a great lebron game, but they gotta lock down on the little things, not just points assists rebounds|Cavaliers|1
People would hate lebron if dropped 50 on 80%.|Celtics|3
*"Ballhog"*|76ers|6
He only had 23 points. He is the man and he has to be able to step up and put points of the board when they need him to win games.|Thunder|2
and not turn the ball over|Timberwolves|2
It's sad but true, he is too good of a player you'd think to be 2-5 in finals. But is what it is.|Cavaliers Bandwagon|2
He wouldn't have as nearly as many Finals appearances if he played in the West. |Knicks|1
Curry forgot the game was tonight? Sure, he shot like crap. But he still had 5 board, 6 assists, and was pulling double teams constantly on cuts which is a big reason why Livingston and the rest were getting such great looks. |Pistons|6
He played okay, but I mean... he tried to back down steph 4 times and failed each time, he passed up open drives, he didn't give great defensive effort if he wasn't on Steph, he went an entire 9:30 without taking a single shot, despite the number of rebounds he didn't actually fight for position for boards after the first quarter, he had 3 really bad turnovers(4 in total), and he didn't shoot well(43%).\n\n\nThat sounds like a lot of hate, but it really isn't- these are just things I noticed that showed Lebron had a *low effort* outing in my opinion. He still played well, but he *Could* have played great in this game with more effort and focus imo.|Magic|4
stats aren't everything dude. he has the ball 80% of the time, he needs to make more happen. stuffing the stat sheet isn't good enough.|Timberwolves|6
LBJ was not at his best tonight. He played ok, but in order for the cavs to win he needs to play flawlessly. However, he played fantastic defense on Steph when he was matched up with him.|Rockets|21
Yeah but he forced a Curry miss which turned into an easy putback because nobody on the Cavs boxed out. LeBron played okay, their offense as a whole was just sloppy. No JR, Love missing like five bunnies, Kyrie taking bad shots.. Just wasn't a good game. The Cavs bench can't match the Warriors bench, and when LeBron comes out the Cavs offense stops in its tracks. |Trail Blazers|1
He needs the rest of the Cavs to show up... as good as he is, noone's a one man team.||1
Pretty crazy that 1 assist short of a triple double game isn't his best, but you're totally right and it shows his level of ability imo|[PHI] Allen Iverson|2
 Not sure what his turnover total was but he definitely was not taking care of the ball. Dray and Iggy were insane defensively. Unfortunately, as you said, he needs to be near perfect |Knicks|3
At least he didn't invade vietnam|Supersonics|9
It's not good enough for him. He was stalling the offense a lot he needs to get it moving more |Nets|52
that's what I was saying. lebrons playing this series exactly like last years'. just isoing in the post while the Warriors cut off passing lanes and strip him when there's an opening, and that won't cut it.|[GSW] Wilt Chamberlain|1
He's the only moving part of that offense |Nuggets|5
Not all on him though, the warriors defense was just that good tonight. They were clogging all the passing lanes and were basically on top of the guys hovering around the 3 pt line. The help defense was always on point and theypretty much contested every shot. The warriors defense was just damn near flawless. |Heat|7
Cavs fans in shambles. LeBron going to have to break his back carrying these fools lmao|Knicks|27
How? When he he's not even leading the team in scoring.? Or only scoring 23 points? Or all those turnovers? Or his team being injured? Oh wait.. Lmao enough with the excuses holy crap you idiots will do anything to back up LeBron \n\n||-10
For non Warriors fans, this was a pretty shit game to watch. \n\n\n- It was only close for a brief period of time, then it turned into a blowout. \n- Warriors stars weren't out there shining like they usually do, it was the bench doing the damage on offense\n- Cavs played stagnant offense most of the time and struggled with their shooting\n\n\nAll that equals a pretty boring game really. I want to see the Warriors stars smashing it, in a close game, where there is good basketball being played by both teams.|Spurs|20
>Cavs played stagnant offense most of the time and struggled with their shooting\n\nI think you have to give the Warriors defense some credit for that. They were making it really tough to drive the lane, they were contesting hard around the rim and were jumping the passing lanes. Cleveland looked pretty stymied out there tonight, it wasn't *just* that the Cavs were being lazy on offense (although there was some of that too, Kyrie's possession to open the 4th quarter comes to mind). I think on the other end the Cavs focused their whole defense on trying to stop Steph and Klay, but in doing so they conceded everything to all the rest of the Warriors, and GS made them pay for it. \n||1
Yeah, some credit to GSW too, but here is a [video breakdown of issues with the Cavs stagnant offense] (https://streamable.com/mgio)|Spurs|1
The Warriors must have been delighted every time LeBron settled for an outside shot, although to be fair they did a good job of baiting him into charges and turnovers on some of his drives. ||1
That was okc. They took us to the brink. Such amazing respect for okc. |Warriors|2
wanted to see warriors vs spurs ||2
It was pretty fun for people who never want to see Cleveland win a title...|Heat|60
I understand rooting for your favorite team, but why the beef against the cavs? One of the smaller markets with a mediocre legacy that still has pretty dedicated fans. GSW deserve it this year though....|Grizzlies|0
I don't like their owner, think he's clownshoes. I have always lived in Chicago and just generally do not like Cleveland sports. |Heat|2
Can atest to this, was grinning like a Jack-O-Lantern during most of the 4th quarter|[NYK] J.R. Smith|1
Confirm Lebron back to Miami next season.|Magic|1
Really?  I always love watching bench mobs kill it.  It's been one of the more charming aspects of the Spurs the past few seasons.||12
That's the Spurs system though (so you kind of expect that with us), everyone scores, no starter above 20ppg for the season, etc. \n\n\nCasual fans are tuning in to see Steph and Klay do their thing, not Livingston or Speights etc. That's why I said it's boring from that side.|Spurs|4
Come on now. As a casual teamless heathen myself, there are probably dozens of us that enjoy it.  Dozens!||4
Good thing Kyrie and Love are healthy this year, what would Cleveland have done without their 14/39 combined shooting tonight?|Warriors|10
Never understood this narrative.\n\nThe only reason the Cavs were even competitive last year was because of the gimmicky style they were playing, and that is not replicable w/ Kyrie and Love playing huge minutes.  |Bulls|1
And to think that's what it took just to keep them afloat, I was thinking it'd be a much more even match up with them playing this time|Warriors|1
Kyrie gonna go for 20 fts next game |Vancouver Grizzlies|1
You know the cavs are in trouble when the Warriors play below average and still blow them out. This isn't like the Thunder series where Klay Thompson and Steph Curry had to go God mode just to barely scrape by a victory.||8
Yeah I'm feeling the same, the warriors are a much better defensive team than the cavs, and it's not like they're worse on the offensive end either so...||1

Shaun "Michael Jordan" Livingston and Andre "Scottie Pippen" Iguodala looking to take this series over|[GSW] Stephen Curry|4
Klay and curry aren't going to score like this much. Cavs missed an opportunity |Heat|4
Are the warriors lucky?|Suns|6
I want to say they dodge one....but the cavs seemed to focus a lot of their defense intensity at klay/curry. The Warriors bench straight up took advantage of it. Instead of luck I'd call it being good at more shit, including defense. |Knicks|2
When Curry got switch to guard James,  I thought Curry will be butchered. But Curry dared James to shoot, and if he dribbles, the help is coming faster than thunder and alter James shot or force him to pass.\n\nInteresting to see if James will start shooting (and importantly, making) threes if guarded by Curry.\n\nSunday can't come fast enough.|Lakers|4
For everybody talking about how the Cavaliers lost when Klay/Steph played poorly, you're forgetting something.\n\nShaun Livingston just shot 80% from the field and Leandro Barbosa shot 100%. Those things will not continue.|Trust The Process|4
KlAy and curry won't be missing those shots either||1
It's stupid to suggest the Cavaliers have no chance to compete when Klay/Steph shoot well as the offensive output of the warriors won't change much considering how amazing the backup guards played tonight.|Trust The Process|2
> as the offensive output of the warriors won't change \n\nMore 3's vs 2's would make a difference...||1
And Steph and Klay won't continue to shoot 20% from the field. That's the point. ||1
Mind boggling that you missed the point of this post|Trust The Process|4
we all know the old saying. Live by the ingston, die by the ingston. |Cavaliers|4
I found it surprising that no one is criticizing Irving for his selfish play on this game.|Celtics|3
Look for Lebron to come out extra aggressive in GM2 and demand the ball on every possession. He's gonna have to work twice as hard to keep this Warriors team at bay and even that might not be enough.||5
He's too old for that shit. His legs were fatigued in the fourth. LeDecline is real.|Warriors|1
Cavs players not named LeBron, Kyrie, or Love: 23pnts 19rebs 2assts 1stl 3blks 4tnvrs\n\nWarriors bench: 45pnts 16rebs 10assts 4stls 1blk 1tnvr||4
Kyrie Irving does not pass the ball. Fuck that guy|Nets|4
 I don't think this is a good judge of how the series will play out. Cav's will wake up for game two but so will Steph and Klay. Or... cancel the eastern conference right now.|Raptors|5
I dont think this will be indicative of the rest of the series either. |Lakers|1
What exactly are they going to do to "wake up"? Every shot was difficult for them, and they have no answer for GSW defensively. The death lineup barely played in this game and that is what has historically killed the Cavs, too. |Bulls|2
Let the overreaction to the Warriors win begin. I remember getting run out of the building multiple times by OKC. \n\nTrue: Boring game. It's 1-0 warriors. End of. |[GSW] Stephen Curry|4
LeBron's suit is ridiculous |Knicks|4
Klay gonna be like where'd you get that shnazzy Hogwarts suit?|Lakers|3
The good news for the Cavs: It looked their plan to implement the OKC offball D on Curry worked to perfection and he only got 11 points.\n\nThe bad news for the Cavs: They still lost 15, 15 Warriors scored double digits, and this was on 33% shooting from deep by the Warriors. \n\nLong Story short; The Cavs need to play defense on everyone else better, not just Steph and Klay. |Bulls|5
The Cavs played great defense if 15 Warriors were in double figures and the team only scored 104 points. |Hawks|2

I dunno.  How'd you feel after game 4, last series?|Warriors|1
That the Thunder were gonna choke in some way.|Rockets|2
A low number of Free throw attempts, Barely anything from the Splash Brothers, Iggy got whacked in the balls (should've been Draymond) and they still win. Wow. |Lakers|3
That's how weak the east is. LBJ can say whatever but when push comes to shove they faced Toronto in the conference games. Fucking Toronto. The finals ended Monday. ||4
Toronto was 2nd in the East, put some respek on their name|Raptors|1
Fun part is that our series with Blazers and OKC, help us get ready for the cavs team. Blazers 3's point shooters were straight fire so we had to tighten our defense for that. OKC had big men that our big men needed to deal with, which prepared us for TT and Mozgov. Iggy and Klay had to defend Durant and Westbrook, now LBJ and Kyrie.||5
Craig David really turned up tonight.|Rockets|3
Here's what I've learned from this game:\n\n-Iggy's playmaking was great tonight, expect to see more of him especially guarding LeBron\n-Livingston can EXPOSE Cavs' guards with his length\n-Barbosa can also expose Cavs' guards with his speed\n-Draymond is back in his element now that he doesn't have to battle against the Thunder big men\n-Small ball will win the Warriors this series because the Cavs lack a true shotblocker besides Mosgov, who saw almost no minutes tonight\n-Putting LeBron on Curry opens up so much more opportunity for guys like Barnes to get looks\n\nBased on what we saw tonight, JR Smith is going to need to ramp it up big time on offense. Warriors are still letting a few boards slip, although they're much better than during OKC series. The Splash Bros just combined for their worst total all season, and it's unlikely to happen again especially considering Cleveland's lack of someone like Roberson who has the reach and quickness to guard the perimeter and midrange as well. The Warriors are significantly deeper than the Cavs, which will serve them very well in this series.\n\nThe Cavs are at a serious disadvantage, especially after the humiliation of getting shredded by the Warriors bench. I'll make a bold prediction and call Dubs in 5\n|[IND] Paul George|4
I don't watch basketball, but I just want to say that spoiler tag is utterly useless.||5
Things that jumped out to me:\n\nKyrie Irving is a defensive liability. I mean, you can\'t knock his hustle on D, but he couldn\'t match up size-wise to anybody. He needs to learn his defensive role, which is to "pester" perimeter players. \n\nThe Cavs need to fight through screens and trust their man-to-man defensive principles. Steph and Klay are tough assignments, but Kyrie/Delly can play Steph and Shumpert/LeBron can play Klay, as long as the hustle and the focus is there.\n\nThe Warriors have more to lose in this series, and their bench played like it. I love seeing role players like Livingston and Barbosa shine. Time for JR, Shumpert, and Thompson to respond. If the Cavs can control the boards, play solid man-to-man D, and keep LeBron/Kyrie fresh enough to sustain offense, they have a good shot. ||3
Serious question, if Lebron is guarding Klay who is guarding Iggy, Livingston, and/or Barnes? It doesn't seem like anyone on the Cavs can play D on these people besides Lebron. |Bulls|2
If we're talking about Cavs starters, it's going to have to be JR, Thompson, or Love. They can all play them, they just need solid man-to-man principles and REBOUNDING. ||1
Love cannot guard any of those people. Thompson will have trouble with them on the perimeter. I think it will be tough for them to have an entire game of solid defense. Not saying they won't win any games but they will need to play solid defense most of the games and have 3 point shooting like they did earlier in the playoffs |Bulls|1
Shump should be on Klay. Bron can alternate like Dray.||1

Darth Vader was a total badass; nobody denies that.  It's fun to watch him force choke Admiral Ozzel, but more fun to watch him come up short.\n\nLeBron is incredible.

i doubt series will be competitive, cavs have too many people on the roster that are unreliable on the defensive end which includes 2 of 3 stars in their starting lineup.\n\n\nedit:  lebron put this team together and picked the coach so if it ends up falling flat he has no one to blame but himself||1

cavs dont stand a chance do they? curry and thompson have bad games and they still lose handily.|Spurs|23
You can't acknowledge that Irving, Love, and LeBron also all shot poorly? Not to mention JR with only one three. Everyone but the Warriors bench played below average. |Trail Blazers|1
Warriors bench won't go nuts like that again, and I don't think cavs will be that bad again. That said, this is concerning for us lol. |Cavaliers|3

Yeah, Curry sure showed them tonight |76ers|-8
Him drawing double teams, leaving a guy open the entire night sure had nothing to do with it. Just like last Finals, he had nothing to do with it then either. |Raptors|6

Yeah but your bench is probably never going to all play this good for maybe a year or two. |Raptors|1
And curry and klay both won't shoot this bad at the same time again either. |[GSW] Tim Hardaway|10
It all should even out!|[GSW] Andre Iguodala|3
Actually if both the Splash Bros and bench play their average, we gain 12.9 points. |Warriors|2
Dude all we know is one game sample it's a completely fair assessment based on the currently available sample.||4
One game with klay and curry combined for only 20. I feel great right now. But we can't let up and curry and klay need to play better. Look what happened after the spurs kicked okc ass. Okc stepped up. But I'm going to over react because I'm a fan and I can't see them losing|[GSW] Tim Hardaway|5
I just think the Cavs tilted their whole defense towards Steph and Klay and took a "let everyone else beat us" approach, and that\'s exactly what happened. I think if the Cavs switch and try a more balanced defense on the Warriors collectively then it will just open things up for Steph and Klay. ||2
where have you been. all ive been hearing all week was how the people coming back cant defend for shit|Bucks|2
I can't wait to hear what the excuse is this year||13
lol. No one is claiming there is an excuse this year. But losing 2 all stars is kind of a big deal. \n\nI dont know why haters dont get that. |Hornets|-6
If the Cavs had just lost Love and Kyrie and had crap replacements that would make more sense. But the reality is that with those two very below average defenders out and replacing them with quality defenders like TT and Delly it made the Cavs into a really top notch defensive team. Now obviously they were not nearly as good on offense, but they were able to beat the Warriors twice last year by playing grueling defense and totally taking the Warriors out of their game. \n\nThis year at full strength the Cavs are a much better offensive team, one of the best in the league, but they are also now a very bad (or at best slightly below average) defensive team. The result was that the Warriors got to play exactly how they wanted to on offense and still managed to play pretty good defense on Cleveland. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I don't think the Cavs stood a better chance of beating the Warriors without Love and Kyrie, but honestly I don't give them much of a chance either way. ||1
> it made the Cavs into a really top notch defensive team\n\nThats true in theory until you face the reality that it put the Cavs in a position where they had to run a 7 man rotation. That kills your defensive intensity late in the series. (Evidenced by Delly needing to get hospitalized for IV nutrition after game 3 or 4). \n\n> Now obviously they were not nearly as good on offense, but they were able to beat the Warriors twice last year by playing grueling defense and totally taking the Warriors out of their game.\n\nLebron ISO is only going to work so much. \n\n> but they are also now a very bad (or at best slightly below average) defensive team.\n\nGoing to disagree with this on the basis of the eye test but nothing I can say will really change your mind so that is that. |Hornets|1
Look, the point is the Cavs would have lost, regardless of injuries. The Warriors were a historically great team last season as well, in case you forgot.|Warriors|1
The Cavs had the best record in the league after January 15 last year. They made a run from the bottom of the east (barely above .500) to 2nd, usurping the Bulls. Even though the warriors won 67, the Cavs had more momentum. Not a very "historic" team when you lose 2 in a row to a team literally consisting of LeBron and 6 role players. |Cavaliers|0
You're forgetting something pretty crucial here: stamina. When you play heavy minutes, you get fatigued down the stretch, you miss shots, you don't get back on D. The Cavs had an 8 man rotation last year, their bench literally consisted of James Jones, Mike Miller and JR Smith. Delly played 44 mins/game, which eventually hospitalized him. TT and Mozgov were our only bigs. Compare that to the plentiful rest curry gets that allows him to consistently hit shots.|Cavaliers|1
I already see some people saying "oh but this Dubs\' team isn\'t the same as last year, we would have had them then"|[NYK] J.R. Smith|1

What I love about this team is that when the two main scorers are off they limit themselves to 15 and 12 shots for the game. Many other superstars in these league would've easily chucked  25+ and got their teammates out of rhythm and disinterested in the game.|Warriors|5

Chill dude, still too early to conclude.||1
Only one game|Heat|1
Damn, golden state is so deep most of their finals MVP candidates are bench players|Warriors|3
The Cavs should be seriously worried. Klay and Steph had awful shooting nights, yet the Warriors *still* won in convincing fashion. Their depth is no joke, and Livingston again delivers with that sexy mid-range/post game. Also the fact that JR only took 3 shots concerns me.|Lakers|3
Cavs' plan was to deny shots for Klay/Steph. They wanted the others to shoot. Their game plan failed tonight. They have to stick to it. If the others beat them 4 out of 7 times, then you got beat. \n\nI don't think CLE should panicked and now start to change their plan. Role players are role players for a reason. ||2
Both missed open shots and layups too. So I except them to score better even with this game plan.||1
I mean they did play good defense on Klay and Steph, but both of them also missed a lot of shots that they normally make, so it's not like the Cavs absolutely shut them down either.|Lakers|1

Why the hell did Fry only play in garbage time? I thought he was the Cavs' sixth man?|Warriors|3
Because he\'s a complete liability on defense and can\'t create shit on offense. He\'s useful when the opponent plays the "quadruple team Lebron and make the others beat us" strategy because he can splash uncontested threes. Delly is the Cavs best bench player against the dubs.|Cavaliers Bandwagon|3
Can't get those 3s off when there's players who can close out. Can't drive or post because he's not that kinda player. Can't play defense. Can't rebound|[OKC] Kevin Durant|4
Dang, literally can't do shit but shoot threes? The black Steve Novak.|Heat|1
Defensively, Cleveland seems to be switching on everything and getting worked into bad matchups. Also standing around dumbfounded (notably Love) when a cutter enters the lane doesn't help. ||3
Love and JR was standing around.|Heat|1
I don't think we should underestimate the importance that Steph, and to some degree Klay had in taking so much pressure from the Cavs team. Really opened up everyone else, and boy did they deliver. |Cavaliers|3
That Livingston jumper on kyrie was nice. He just kept staying in the air while kyrie floated down.|Supersonics|3
Lol where are all those people saying that the Warriors are shit without klay and Steph?||3
Anyone else notice LeBron played like how he played when Kyrie and Love weren't in the finals last year? \n\nIso, Post up, Drive, Pass to an open man, repeat...\n\nNot gonna get it done against GSW||3
He had to.|Heat|1
And that is why the roster has 15 spots. The Warriors went out tonight and proved what s powerfully deep team they are.|Pistons|3

Kyrie got annihilated on defense tonight, whoever he guarded just put him on the block or set themselves up for slashes/backdoor cuts to the basket and feasted |Lakers|3
What was JR Smith actually doing for the 36 minutes he was on the court? 1-3 shooting, 3 pts, 1 reb, 1 ast, 5 fouls|Spurs|3
Playing very good defense on Thompson and Curry tbh. ||2
feeling depressed. what positives can the cavs take away from this game?|Cavaliers|3
JR Smith won't go 1-3 again, and barbosa and livingston won't have games like this again |Hawks|2
Cavs outrebounded the Warriors. |Warriors|4
I think people are overeacting just a little bit about this game. LeBron had the same problem vs the thunder and Spurs about a nonexistent bench when he was in Miami but he managed to make it work then. No bias here just saying this series may be a bit more different than where it seems it is headed. ||3
'overeating'|Warriors|1
It is closer to 2014 Spurs than 2013 Spurs. |Warriors|1
DWade and Bosh play excellent defense though.||2
Of course they are. Its the Finals! People are going to over react and predict sweep or GSW in 5. Then the course correction after game 2 will be just as reactionary if the Cav's win. \n\nPeople always have extreme recency bias in the Finals. |Lakers|3
OKC didn't die for this|Warriors|3
Tyronn Lue had the perfect game plan, unfortunately it didn't work because Love sucks.  Isolate Love in the post, watch him jack up a layup.  \n\nLove used to be automatic from the post.  I don't know what happened to him coming onto the cavs, but i feel like he sees himself as Kyrie and Lebron's suborindate instead of their teammate.|Lakers|3

serious question: not to rub salt in the wound but are there any Cavs fans that feel optimistic about winning this series after watching tonight's game? |Bulls|3
Right here...\n\n\n\nThe dubs bench played a career game. I doubt it would happen again. If... IF... we can keep Steph and Klay to this same shooting night, we'll be fine.\n\n\n\nIt's game 1|Cavaliers|3
I actually agree with you.   Warriors are supposed to win this game. As good as their defense and bench looked, in a playoff series things can change overnight.  Adjustments get made.  \n\nThat being said, your "if" statement is simply not happening.  They can slow them down like OKC did at times, but there\'s no way they\'ll repeat this type of shooting performance.  But neither will their bench.  We\'ll see.  I wouldn\'t be concerned either way until a home team loses a game.|Warriors|1
My "if" statement is what scares me the most. It\'s inevitable that Steph and Klay will go off and we just hope to have an answer. \n\n\n\nAnd I agree... I\'ve said from the beginning that we need to win one of these first 2 games to have a chance. I don\'t have faith in us winning 4/5 games against you guys|Cavaliers|2
I mean... It's just one game. Anything can happen.... Right?|Supersonics|2
holy hell I'd love if Shaun Livingston won Finals MVP. That would be a hell of a story|Raptors|3
I like to call Livingston mid-range Curry, if you have a smaller defender on him, he is going to take you to the free throw line and bury it in your face every time. Iggys defense is insane too, some of the fastest hands and best positioning in the game today.|Warriors|3
Draymond better be training with iggy|Warriors|2

The crazy thing is the splash bros had a ton of good open looks too. Cavs played good defense on them but it's not all their defense, if they hit those open shots they would have won by 40||1
for what its worth (absolutely nothing), Lebron led team has not won finals game 1 since Dallas vs Miami. |Lakers|3
Actually they lost that one too lol. Just won 4 straight after. |Kings|3
Oh wow haha youre right, i fixed it|Lakers|2
The big news is Kevin Love is no longer undefeated in playoff game on US soil.|Supersonics|3
That's a big wall of truth right there|Lakers|3
I'm sorry all the cavs fan here, but I just have to say the cavs are a bad defensive team, the three ball wasn't the difference yesterday, nor was steph/klay, it was just bad defense from the cavs allowing easy assists that led to easy dunks, layups, etc... They can't have allow some of those mismatches either, like livingston hitting that midrange jumper over a smaller player, overally very poor defensive display from the cavs, and I'd be surprised if they got past game 5 in oracle, I feel the warriors win all home games this series and there's a very real chance they steal one in Cleveland too.||3

Yeah it could, but that would be a shock, spurs vs young lebron 2.0? ||1

I don't even take that as salt. He's just reacting the way I often do hearing reporters ask dumb ass questions. ||1
Can't tell if tonight was a result of the Warriors coming off a hard fought series against OKC or if this was a result of the Cavs not being truly tested so far in the playoffs. Game 2 will tell. The Warriors can't afford a let down. Need to take care of business in Game 2 to maintain control.\n\nWarriors in 5.|[GSW] Latrell Sprewell|5

Love played fine?|Lakers|3
Would you say soft as Wonder Bread?|Warriors|3
I don't get the Love bashing. He had 17 and 13. That's perfectly good. He wasn't why they lost.||3
love played well|Cavaliers|13
He missed so many layups. |Heat|4
He's been shooting 20% at the rim this postseason. The fact that he got so many good looks, played decent defense, and boarded well is pretty encouraging. Kyrie played good defense on curry but was overwhelmed when the dubs switched bigger guys onto him|Cavaliers|5
Everytime Iggy was on him, it was a huge mismatch in Love's favor- he moved Iggy out the damn way and did whatever he pleased... he just couldn't get the shots/layups to fall.|Magic|2
that's an UGLY number for a big that is paid that much. 20..jesus. |Heat|4
yeah it's awful but considering how everybody saying love would be useless against the warriors..he definitely stood his ground. He was getting all of the shots he wanted|Cavaliers|2

I have no idea why Channing Frye didn't get more than 7 minutes. The guy has been shooting so effectively and been playing so smooth on the offensive end. He would have been really valuable in this game.|Rockets|5
My thought was that GSW was really effective at recovering on shooters at the 3pt line.  Frye didn't get his usual open looks, and once that happened he was just a liability on the floor.|[GSW] Draymond Green|6

Shaun Livingston is GOAT |[CHA] Kemba Walker|2
I mean who didn't expect Shaun Livingston to have the same amount of points as Curry & Thompson COMBINED|Warriors Bandwagon|2
The Cavs were throwing double teams at both Klay and Steph off and on the ball all night. The result of them overloading on both those guys was wide open looks for everybody else. I know everybody has been praising the Warriors depth all year, but this game was the very embodiment of that|Raptors|2
They also continued the trend of mean mugging Curry when he was making off the ball cuts like the Thunder did and it worked. He didn't look comfortable all night. Unfortunately Livingston decided not tonight for the cavs|Bulls|1
This is going to be a good series. The Cavs defense executed well, for the most part. They denied Thompson and Curry the ball, made the other players beat them. Unfortunately for the Cavs, the other players did beat them. \n\nThe Cavs need to make some changes on offense. Too much iso and not enough ball/man movement. I don't really expect Kyrie/LeBron/Love to all shoot that poorly again. \n\nThe Warriors played great defense tonight. Really well done on Love and Kyrie. LeBron was getting pretty good looks, he was just so off tonight.\n\nIt will be interesting to see the Warriors offense in Game 2. I expect Cleveland to stick to their gameplan and continue to deny Klay/Steph. If the bench players decide to not go god mode, the Cavs have a pretty decent chance.\n\nOverall a disappointing game as a Cavs fan, but there are positives to take from it. Win Game 2 and we have homecourt advantage and some momentum heading back home. |Cavaliers|2
9-21 is just off of 50 percent||1
It's 42 percent, not great by Bron's standards|Cavaliers|1
This game goes to show just how valuable and underrated GS\xe2\x80\x99s bench is.  People always talking on here like the Warriors shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t hesitate to sign KD even if it means stripping their entire bench for vet min contracts.  How many teams can have their top two players player so poorly in the playoffs yet easily win the game?  Former top 5 pick in Shaun Livingston..former 6th man of the year in Barbosa..Former finals MVP in Iggy.  Even more depth with Speights and Ezeli. 39 bench points to the Cavs 5 bench points (halfway through the 4th).   That\xe2\x80\x99s what happens when you have a quality bench over a bunch of minimum contracts and washed up players.  They are such a well rounded team and it\xe2\x80\x99s respectable how much time and work has been poured into rounding out such a tremendous roster.\n|Celtics|2

Even with all his teammates healthy LeBron gets zero help. What can you even do when it's just you vs. an all time team?|[MIL] Giannis Antetokounmpo|2
Cavs did not look like the same team offensively compared to earlier in the playoffs. They were not moving the ball and they kept going to iso ball and you can't beat GSW with iso ball because of their elite defense. I think they need to give frye more minutes, 5 minutes (or how ever many he played) all game is unacceptable for a guy that's been shooting it that well. \n\n\nLivingston was OP from midrange this game and borbosa was killing it all game. Quite the game from GSW's bench, steph and lay barely had to do anything. Hope the next game is closer but GSW played like the reigning champs tonight.\n|Timberwolves|2
This does not bode well for the cavs. If you lose when Steph and Klay score so little, what will happen when they drop like 25 each???||2

really hoping we got to see some closer game this series, the playoffs have been overwhelmingly un-exciting this year IMO ||2
'The Saun Livingston and Andre Igoudala led Warriors surge to first game victory in series opener. A pair of three point shots by bench role players Curry and Thompson in the fourth help seal the deal.'|Warriors|2
Shaun Livingston is a stretched out Steph confirmed! |Warriors|2
Warriors bench killed it tonight. Cavaliers defense seemed "mostly" okay. Offense was the real show-stopper for me. Lots of guys sitting at the perimeter, watching bad Irving, Love, and Lebron ISOs all night. If you\'re going to commit to iso ball, you gotta shoot way better than those 3 did tonight.\n\nNeed to get outside shooters more involved to have a chance offensively.|Cavaliers|2
As someone who didn't watch the game, how come Channing Frye played like zero minutes?|Rockets|2
Bron went 9 minutes without taking a shot?!?  Does he want to win?||2
Cavs really need to figure out what to do with Kyrie on the defensive end. I felt like every basket late in the 3rd and throughout the 4th was scored by the man Kyrie was guarding. |[SAS] Tim Duncan|2
Every game has a different story-line. If the Cavs win game 2, the series shifts dramatically. If not, then we're fucked i'll tell you that. we can't afford to shoot under 40% again|Cavaliers|2
Lebron's son must be so hyped right now|Warriors Bandwagon|2
Sunday can't come soon enough. Have to go through the overreactions from both fanbases.|Cavaliers|2
It just goes to show in these playoffs that it doesn't matter how it happens, a loss is a loss and a win is a win.  I'm not gonna overreact.  A split was probably the best we could hope for anyway so we just have to come out stronger in game 2.  I mean if Steph and Klay play well and the bench shoots like that no one would have a chance anyway.|Cavaliers|2
Knicks better|Lakers|2
Let's go boys! Great win. And might add that ESPN coverage is kinda bad, TNT coverage was so much better.|Warriors|2

WCF was da real Finals.|Warriors|2
Winning by double digits with Steph and Klay playing like garbage? I'm confident about this series. |Warriors|2
If you just told me the stats of the big stars like "Lebron almost had a triple double - 1 assist short, and the Splash Bros only had 20 points combined." I\'d be like, "Dang. The Cavs outplayed the Warriors."\n\nCrazy.|Spurs|2
Warriors have play-makers off their bench in Iggy, Livingston and Barbosa.\n\nCavs bench have....well, Frye, Delly and Shumpert and none of them can run an offense. \n\nNot even fair. LOL||2
Soooo... anyone else catch the cop looking?|Bulls|2
Cav's come expecting Klay and Steph, [but end up watching the warrior's bench like.](http://i.imgur.com/e9sJAf7.png)|Warriors|2
7 seven Warriors in double digit scoring. Klay wasn't one of them and Curry barely was one of them.|Warriors|2
Crazy how Livingston went from relearning how to walk, to being the deciding factor in a finals game.|Heat|2

As a member of the Reddit Consortium, I could confidently say, "WARRIORS at 3"|[GSW] Sarunas Jasikevicius|2
Idk why but this game felt so much less intense than the Okc games. Idk if it was the production or just a result of the mostly lopsided game. Those Okc games the Oracle and the thunders area sounded so loud on TV. The Oracle sounded muted tonight for some reason but I suspect it was actually loud as fuck in there. I wasn't very invested and was actually looking away from the screen most of the time. Its weird too because I had a huge setup for this game, made some delicious snacks and sat in my love seat and just couldn't even pay attention. Was so hyped up for this rematch and it felt so flat. Can anyone else relate? |Nuggets|2
TnT vs ABC/ESPN broadcasting difference\n\nABC mutes the crowd noise for the nationwide broadcast |Warriors|3
I'm going to wait until game 3 to judge how this series is going to go. |Heat|2
I still say Warriors in seven, we all wrote off the Thunder when they got blown out by the Spurs and look what happened|Cavaliers Bandwagon|2
THE GRAPHIC IS ALL WRONG|Pistons|2
Cavs played like they don't even care, while Thunders are like I died for this? lol||2
right after Adams got hit in the groin the Thunder went berserk.\nright after Iggy got hit in the groin the Warriors also went berserk.|[LAC] Chris Paul|2
So what's the excuse for lebron tonight guys |Warriors|2

GSW seems to have much smoother path for a repeat title against Cavs than last year.|Lakers|2
This win is delicious. I love this team man. It was obvious that Klay and Steph were gonna be dragging a bit. They just pulled off this Herculean 3-1 feat, breaking records and getting so hot. And Shaun Livingston was oddly off during the thunder series , for a guy who is usually so money with that little jumper. And there's an obvious camaraderie on this team that has Barbosa and Livingston and Barnes and Igoudala stepping up to fill in. Next man up, they really mean that. If you love team basketball you love seeing these guys have each other's backs. |Charlotte Hornets|2
LMAO FUCK LEBRON|Bulls|2
If i just looked at the points totals for the starters from both teams, i would just assume Cleveland won the game by a landslide.||2
You know when it's early where you live when you wake up and see that the game is still going on. Great win for the Warriors nonetheless! |[GSW] Stephen Curry|2
I think the Cavs focused on stop Steph and Klay from dominating and forcing the rest of the team to beat them.  I don't think this is that bad of a loss, can the other players keep this type of offense up for three more games? The Cavs also shot horribly from the field, so how many more games will they all shoot that bad?  I think the Cavs can leave this game knowing they only need to win one in Oakland and feel okay with the loss.  |Lakers|2
maybe if the cavs ran some actual pick and roll plays like the warriors instead of the OKC-choke ISO play, then maybe they would score. it really pissed me off tonight watching that happen for all 4 quarters|Lakers|2
So I guess nobody realized that when you replace defense with offense against a top defensive team you don't win ||2
We won yuuuup!\nSplash brothers noooope!\n*all in draymond drunk voice*|Warriors|2
Come on, OP, what about the box score?\n\nEdit:  There you go, better late than never.|Bulls|2
If you're the Cavs, what kind of adjustments do you make? I feel like they need to find a way to incorporate Frye more. Maybe up the usage rate for lebron too.|Bulls|2
When the Cavs post up iso, players need to cut to the hoop. Defensively I like where they were and if JR has another first half like that the Cavs need to play Frye, or Shumpert. I think Shumpert on Livingston could cause problems for GS.||1
Get LeBron out of the perimeter and into the paint, GS doesn't have anybody that can guard him one-on-one in the post. |Kings|1
You stumped me. The difference today just seemed to be that the Warriors made shots and the Cavs didnt. Offensively they gotta get kyrie to stop this one on one iso bullshit leading to the long two, but that's Kyrie's game...|Cavaliers Bandwagon|2
Maybe its time for the Cavs to go and try to outscore the Warriors next game. IMO, the Cavs sacrificed their scoring for defense.|Heat|2
That's a VERY scary strategy|[OKC] Kevin Durant|2
You want the Cavs to give up 130 points?|Heat|3
I do.|Heat|1
If the Cavs can put up 131, that's fine. They do look spent on defense and even if LeBron is a Machine, he cannot play 2-way for 40++ mins for the whole series. He'll cramp up Miami-style.\n\nFrye was even played for only around 5 mins in a game where his offense was much more needed than his effort on defense.|Heat|2
What an odd game.. I can't decide who this was better for. \n\nCleveland played pretty bad - turned it over a bunch and shot the ball horribly - I don't think they hit 40% from the field. Outside the numbers, they looked stagnant. Their role players didn't show up AT ALL - yet they were able to keep it pretty close most of the game, and on the road. \n\nGS ends up winning by 15, and Klay and Steph were horrible. Draymond made some key plays, but his shooting was ugly. Kinda scary they were able to pull this out. Yet I don't feel comfortable predicting that GS bench will continue to play THAT well. \n\nTypically, LeBron bounces back well after a game one loss, but we'll have to wait for Game 2 to find out! \n\n(Sorry if I sound like Magic Johnson) |Hawks|2
Kyrie Irving had a dreadful game tbh. When Lebron came off to rest he became selfish AF, taking isolated fade away jump shots. I think if Lebron is going to be resting Kyrie needs to be getting to the rack and scoring in the paint, not settling for outside shots. Anyway I think the Cavs have a very good game plan but had a woeful night shooting the ball. If Iguodala and Livingston beat you you have to be able to hang your hat on that.||2
23-12-9 from LeBron and 26 from Irving, but I wouldn't say either of them played particularly well. LeBron played one of those dumb frustrating games that he has here and there.\n\nLivingston/Iguodola/Barbosa saved Curry's ass in this one.|Cavaliers Bandwagon|2
Yo.. cleveland and golden state had identical 3pt shooting percentages... both 33.3% and identical free throw percentages.. 90% lol |Hawks|2
How the fuck does a team afford that kind of a bench? I'm not aware of Golden State's finances but it's mind boggling how they can assemble a bench like that financially speaking.|Bulls|2
Well, it starts with how cheap Steph's deal is for a superstar. Then you have a bunch of home grown talent who haven't gotten their big contracts yet like Barnes and Ezeli and they are in a very interesting position. AND! they can waive Barnes and Ezeli and sign a KD level player. |Lakers|1
> AND! they can waive Barnes and Ezeli and sign a KD level player.\n\nIs it bad that I would rather they kept Barnes and Ezeli instead of a KD level player...?||1
I dont know if it's bad... It would be a different appraoch to team building than what they have used so far. \n\nI am not sure they should keep both, with the price they are going to command. I would probably resign Ezeli since Bogut seems to be on his last legs. I feel like you could probably pick up a ring chaser or two to fill Barnes role for a lot cheaper and keep your roster flexibility. \n\nBut what do I know, Im not a GM. |Lakers|1
Yeah, mostly I was just thinking with Thompson, Curry, and Green, the GSW have enough scorers and I feel like the depth of their bench has done wonders and should be continued.||1
Livingston was a journey guy and getting bounced around.  Barbosa also.  Teams gave up on them and didn't utilize them correctly.  |Warriors|1
Barbosa was a key member of some great Suns teams -- he has just lost his quickness, which was a key part of his game. Most players who depend on quickness fade quickly when they age, and it's to Barbosa's credit that he was able to reinvent himself. That said, he is close to the end of his career at this point.|Warriors|1
Nobody has gotten paid yet. Team will look different next year when barnes and ezeli get over paid by despo teams |Hawks|2
I was just saying how GS should be way over us in the luxury tax lol. That bench are playing at a level like starters for other NBA teams. |Cavaliers|2
The bench plays mediocre all year to give the disguise of being an average and not worth much bench then comes into the playoffs like starters lol||2
GSW\'s payroll is fourth in the NBA behind (in order) CLE, LAC, OKC. Klay and Draymond took below max contracts, Steph is still on his "fear of ankle injuries" contract.|Warriors|3
I think the key is they also worked to develop the talents of those guys after signing them as well. They all brought skills to the team, but then those skills were honed and gelled with the system in place. ||3
Scariest thing is Cleveland are spending more on theirs. |76ers|3
what a game for Barbosa!||2
Lue re: a talk about question:\n\n"Talk about what?"\n\nI now like Tyronn Lue|Warriors|2

Shaun's voice is surprising. |Lakers|2

Delly was -19 in 10 minutes. Shaun was +22ish on 25 minutes. \n\nLMAO|Warriors|1
Kyrie or Delly on Livingston is a nightmare for CLE.|[GSW] Stephen Curry|2
When you have to play a team like OKC against 2 of the best players in the NBA for 7 games, im sure GSW 's level of competion is set at a very high level, and gave them an advantage coming into the finals imo. I think thats what happened tonight and shook the Cavs a little bit. Im sure now they know they're gonna have to step it up and adjust for the next game. |Hawks|2
If you think about it, each playoff series gave us much needed experience dealing with the current cavs team.\n\nHouston: Klay had to cover Harden. A hard task especially since he's proficient at drawing fouls. Curry had to deal with the pesky defense of Bev. Very good experience for dealing with the Dirty Aussie and Kyrie.\n\nPortland: Their shooters were straight fire. Our defenders had to step up to chase em off the line. Klay also had to take Lillard. Quick, strong, and a three point game. Also Bogut had to learn how to deal with guards like Lillard trying to get his ass into foul trouble.\n\nOKC: Klay had to cover Westbrook. Iggy on Durant. Our big men had to tangle with athletic freaks like Adams. Their switching actually kept pace with our offense, until we finally got the switches on your big men.\n\nNow we have the Cavs three point shooting, big men, and the athletes like LBJ and Kyrie. Long as Draymond can keep KL in check, the warriors can pull it off.||2
Warriors bench: 19 for 32\n\nCavs bench: 3 for 8|Knicks|2
So far so good. 3 more to go!||2
Andre Miller played really well this game.|[GSW] Stephen Curry|2

Does anyone know why Mozgov didn't get much pt? He was good in the series last year|Warriors|2
He doesn't keep up well with Ty Lue's offense.  His hands are like bricks.|Cavaliers|1
They looked like they wanted to "play small" against us|Warriors|2
He had surgery after last season and hasn't been the same. No minutes all year.|Kings|4
God Damn. Shumpert, Frye, Jefferson & Dellavedova combined for 47min, 3/8 FG, 1/4 3pt, 4 reb's, no blocks, no steals & 2 turn overs.\n\nI guess on the up-side, Dellavedova was 100% accurate with the nut-punches tonight. So yeah, I guess there's that.||2
Shumpert isn't out there for anything but defense. He can't finish around the rim and is a below average shooter. \n\nRichard Jefferson? C'mon man. |76ers|0
Frye got like four of those minutes - Down the stretch one point game and 3 of those 4 are in the game with a lost JR. Lost the momentum built by Love and Irving and ultimately the game.|Cavaliers|2
After game 7 ive kind of gotten myself ready for the warriors to win again, but man am I hoping for Lebron to go beserk these next few games and dad dick his way into a finals win. Hope man||2
means nothing if his team mates aint doing shit to help him.  It's a team sport.|Raptors|2
Anyone got a gif of the 1st quarter when Curry hit TT with the jab step?|Warriors Bandwagon|2
Canada didn't die for this shit Cavs, get it together. |Raptors|2
Canada was supposed to die in the second round. Hell, the east were prophesied to die regardless who came out the east.|Heat|2
Who shot JR? Completely disappeared. |Warriors|2
He's got a tendency to go MIA in big games. Outside of the final game last series between them (when he only showed up after it was out of reach) he pulled a disappearing act. |76ers|2
They got nothing out of Curry and Thompson, but look at their bench. Livingston was 8-10, Barbosa 5-5, and then Bogut who usually doesn't give much goes 5-7. Cleveland also got nothing from JR Smith and shot poorly|Celtics|2
Spurs in 6||2
Ayyyy||1
Would the Thunder win a Cleveland v. OKC finals matchup?|Timberwolves|2
Easily||0
No contest. Westbrook would eat Irving for lunch and the Cavs have no answer for KD. |Celtics|1
But would they beat Kentucky||1
a question, why does ezili get playing time and speights close to non?\noffensivly speights is terrific while ezile always puts up basicly no numbers offensivly with a couple of boards. i dont see why bigs like ezili and varejao get prioretized.||2
because speights cannot defend||6
Go Warriors from the UK||2
Let's just say Cleveland lost in 4 or 5 games. I feel like the incentive for Durant to stay with OKC is much higher. |76ers|2
Durant should sign a 1+1 with Thunder, then trade Durant to Cavs for Love. KD gets his guaranteed Finals runs. Westbrook gets to be the undisputed #1 in OKC.|Heat|-1
Are the Thunder that stupid? Love is garbage compared to KD. |Bulls|2
Thunder might not have a choice if KD doesn't want to stay, at least they get something out of this versus him just walking away and it's a bit of insurance against Westbrook leaving the next year since Love has 4 years remaining. It may convince Westbrook to stay as the de facto #1 or it may drive him to leave and they at least can build around Love.|Heat|1
My dream would be for KD to go to some semi contender in the East so someone could challenge Cleveland. It's like Cleveland and a bunch of corpses at this point. |Bulls|1
Why would KD want to go from having to deal with the Warriors to having to deal with the Cavs, I think he would prefer a straight ticket to the Finals.|Heat|1
how is him staying a straight ticket to the finals? SA/GS is tougher than CLE imo |Bulls|1
Him going to Cleveland is a straight ticket to the Finals|Heat|1
How is that even a possibility though|Bulls|1
He signs a 1+1 with Thunder then the Thunder trade him for Love to get something rather than risk KD leaving and getting nothing. KD is a massive upgrade over Love and while Love isn't KD, he's better than nothing for OKC - this might even make Westbrook happy as he becomes the undisputed #1 in OKC and maybe even convinces him to stay long-term. Worst case, it drives Westbrook out and then they can rebuild around Love - not ideal, but far better then having absolutely nothing if both KD and Westbrook leave.|Heat|1
I can dream |Raptors|2
If I were him, I'd stay for one more year. He and Westbrook have amazing on court chemistry. They are one role player away. |Celtics|2
From what I remember last year the bench played a pivotal role in winning that championship. Klay Thompson was nearly non-existent and Curry was nothing special. I'm pretty sure Livingston was an animal last year too.  Iggy obviously was..|76ers|2
havent catch up with cavs lately but can anyone tell me why T. Mozgov isnt getting much gametime??|Cavaliers Bandwagon|2
Lue runs a different style of offense, and Mozzy can't keep up with the pace.  His legs I think are fine, it just seems that with the way we moved the ball after Lue became HC, his hands turned into bricks and he was never quite ready for the pass.\n\nThat said, I can understand your confusion based on last night; the Cavs offense looked frustratingly similar to Blatt's.  If we're gonna run that style, I do think Mozgov can get some meaningful minutes, but I don't want to run that style of offense.  I want to run the offense that decimated the East.|Cavaliers|1
West is Best||2
So some things to take away from this game I took were:\nLebron gun lebron no matter what lebron Bron.\n\nCavs needs Kyrie love and Smith to play better (they didn't play bad) than they did tonight to win. Then do it 4 out of 7 times.\n\nBench or splash brothers can score and turn up for the win, whoever is on fire.||2
>Lebron gun lebron no matter what lebron Bron\n\nWant you to know that I will be using this phrase IRL from now on.||1
Based on the post game interviews, Kerr is just a way better coach than Lue.  Kerr clearly has a list of things he\'s going to "fix" that he thinks the Ws didn\'t do well.  Lue looks like he had a plan -- to shut down Curry and Thompson -- and it worked, yet he still lost, and now he has no idea what to do.  I think he\'s literally going to make no changes, hope his team shoots better, and hope the Ws bench doesn\'t go for 45 again (and that Steph and Klay keep to 20 points a game combined).||2
I'm just here to overreact.|Heat|4
Now Cavs fans can understand that even at full strength, your defense sucks w/Irving/Love and Warriors still win.|Warriors|5
yup Cavs will just fold over and give up now. i forgot the finals were decided in 1 game|Cavaliers|0
The better team always wins.  Cavs lack multi dimensional players.  Either a player is good offensively or defensively.  There will always be weaknesses every time and the Warriors will exploit it.  This series is over unless injuries come into play|Warriors|3
Built vs bought.\n\nSums it up.\n||4
Well said||0
Worked in miami|Heat|2
This series will be a dud. Warriors in 5. |Rockets|5
The warriors bench isn't scoring 45 points again in game 2, but curry isn't scoring 11 again either|Knicks|3
People will overreact and say klay and curry played bad so cavs are fucked.....but the bench for the warriors played too well. It will even it up. |Celtics|5
Yeah everyone acting like Livingston will be god mode every game. He'll get his shots up but he was connecting on everything. Barbosa made some insane shots as well||1
As much as non-Warriors fans like to poke fun at our slogan "Strength in Numbers," it surely rang true tonight.|Warriors|3

LBJ -10, Irving -10, Love -9\n\nThe title "Coach Lue" is already laughable as is.  Does anyone really think they can make any adjustments?\n|Warriors|2
They can move a little better when LeBron is in the post. |Warriors|2
Yes! Actually, I think there are several different things they could try. Though honestly I think the biggest adjustment needed is one that they will not do. \n\nIt is my opinion that the Cav's looked to create their offense from the Post and vs Mismatches way to often. Teams often fall into this counter-intuitive trap, they see a mismatch and try to post, but that slows down the offense and doesn't give others enough touches. \n\nLBJ wants to roast people on the block, and take advantage of the incoming double, but look at the shot clock in those possessions.\n\nThe Cav's are much scarier to me when they run PnR and drive to the basket. That creates chaos, and their shooters knock down shots in chaos. |Lakers|6
Iggy 4 Prez, Warriors in 2 1/2, Lebron to Penguins. Confirmed.|Raptors Bandwagon|4
Green and Varejao with the two most agregious flops of the night|Lakers|4
Really, I think this game is a few bad breaks for the Cavs. A bunch of missed lay ups/ tip ins; Livingston and Barbosa (10pts in 11 minutes) having the games of their lives. I get that the cool thing to do now is declare GS the champs, but there's a lot of basketball left. |Hawks|4
People don't realize that Barbosa's role all year was instant slashing offense and wide open threes. Dude comes in and plays 100 mph for a couple minutes, constantly taking the ball to the cup. That's just what his role is. Livingston is entirely about taking care of the ball, making solid passes and getting to his midrange spots for automatic Js. If you let Livingston easily get to his spots, he's gonna hit many more times than not.|[GSW] Tom Gugliotta|3
i think klay and steph gonna come strong in game home and i hope for another warriors win \n\n#GO WARRIORS|West|3
I don't care how much you're losing in Game 1 against a team that won 73 games you play it out to the end and you play hard. \n\nGive them something to remember you by in the next game. Soft as shit performance considering its 2 best players didn't perform to their best and obviously had a game 7 hangover.\n\nLebron needs to stop this lovefest he has going on and call his team out especially that bench who were putrid and innfective. |Celtics|2
Cavs defense will be their demise. Warriors match up too well and their spacing is killing the Cavs. |[SAS] Kawhi Leonard|4
So uhh lebron needs more help?|Lakers|2
I mean, in terms of some the players on his team actually playing well (JR Smith), yeah he does|Supersonics|1
1 assist shy of a triple double and still can't escape this shit. I'm so glad the internet and espn weren't what they are now when MJ was playing or when Kobe/Shaq were dominating. |NBA|2
"1 assist shy of a triple double" is a Tuesday for LeBron. We all know [who he is](http://thestartingfive.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/bronseries-300x300.jpg) when he wants to be. But God-mode LeBron didnt show up tonight, just normal \'kick out to kevin love for 3\' LeBron. |[PHI] Tony Wroten|2
SWEEEEEEEEEEEP ||4
Man that Cavs defense in the 4th against the bench was pretty pathetic... it was practically all of their starters too. It\'s pretty obvious after tonight\'s game that our starting unit should be Livingston/Barbosa/HB/Iggy/Dray with Steph and Klay\'s "subpar" performance.|Warriors|3
Do you not think their performance was subpar?|Supersonics|1
The Cavs can take some solace in the fact that they were able to get a lead in this game and saw what intensity was needed to ascertain it.  The problem?  They didn't maintain it in that 4^th quarter and they paid dearly for it, but it's only one game.\n\nThis will *still* be an interesting series despite the final score of Game 1 (15 point loss).|Rockets|3
But can the Cavs keep up that defense intensity? It is clearly hurting their offense.|Heat|1
That's the intriguing question and what will make (or break) this series.  I think they can and they'd be inclined to do so because they can't win in a shootout with the Warriors \xe2\x80\x94 they'd prefer a game in the 80s.|Rockets|1
Defense is a lot more work and harder work than offense, If they plan on keeping up the defense intensity then I cant see this series going more than 4 games, Cavs will be dead tired before they make it to game 3.|Heat|1
And once again, no one will dare find fault with Lebron because stats. Does he need *more* help?  \n\nI'm sorry, not sorry, I can't help it. I know it's an unpopular opinion and will get Lebronies upset, and get me called all sorts of names but that is not my primary intention.  \n\nAnd yes, the series is far from over.|Knicks|3
the bench could step up and Love/Irving really need to pick up the defense, but you're right. Lebron accounted for some crucial turnovers and easy layup misses that led to Warriors points. As much as he creates openings, he also made a ton of mistakes that gave GS' bench momentum to keep it going. |Clippers|1
What should he do to change his game, then?|Cavaliers Bandwagon|1
Develop a reliable perimeter shot, and mid-range game.  \n\nAnd if he already has, USE IT, so that it\'s a threat. He shouldn\'t worry about missing 4 outside jumpers in a row if they\'re giving it to him. That\'s not selfish, that\'s your best way to win. As soon as he makes a few in a row (that\'s the rub, but we\'ve seen him do it before), the defense is going to have to react. And if/when they do, it\'s over, he\'s going to be able to get to the rack, break down the defense, whatever. And even if it\'s not "over", this strategy gives you a heck of a lot better chance of winning than whatever they\'re doing now.  \n\nBut what do I know, seriously. Just my opinion.|Knicks|2
The problem with Lebron is sometimes his stats don't produce wins in big games. But his fans don't care|Thunder|2
bingo. it has been a trend in his career. great guy great player. controversial take, i know, but a superduperstar* is responsible for the stats of his teammates (ie his team). \n\n*with enough help. very subjective.|Knicks|1
ROFL, have we put the whole the East is better narrative to rest yet?|Warriors|3
GSW gonna win for 3 obvious reasons. \n\n1) defense\n\n2) their bench\n\n3) their coaching. ||2
4) They will score more points.|Heat|2
5) They will win 4 games before the Cavs do. |Kings|2
Cavs are fully healthy and well rested. Dubs had to win 3 in a row on a red hot OKC team that had previously beaten the Spurs, a team with one of the best regular season records in history. \n\nI wonder what clever excuses people will come up with to shit on the warriors and say they didn't deserve it after they win this championship. ||4
Could be interpreted as GSW having momentum and the Cavs being a bit rusty. Home team winning a weird, sloppy game 1 is not unusual. Can't count the Cavs out until we see how/if they bounce back on Sunday |Cavaliers|1
It's not just the win though. The dubs carried the momentum the entire game. Everything came easy. I just don't think the cavs have the right match ups to make this competitive. ||2
The Cavs had their runs and came back to lead in the 3rd after trailing by 13... That's with their bench & Love/JR being completely absent. No surprise to see the home team run away with it, but there's reason to believe CLE can sneak out a win in game 2. \n\nAs far as match ups go I'm not sure I agree. Sure Livingston is a nightmare, but I'd take my chances with him putting up a high volume of contested shoulder jumpers as opposed to a Curry 3. |Cavaliers|1
>after they win this championship. \n\nThey just came back from 1-3. Relax|[OKC] Kevin Durant|3
I mean, what else are these threads good for if not over reaction? ||4
This game seem 100% unlikely to repeat itself the way it went on. \n\n1. The Warrior's bench can't possibly have such an amazing game again, a good one sure, but as ridiculously good as this one, don't think so. \n\n2. Steph and Klay won't have such low numbers again, even as well defended as they were. \n\n3. The Cavs bench can't really suck this much again. They combined for 10pts, 1 assist, 6 rebounds, that's 13pts, 2 assists and 7 rebounds if you count JR. Iguodala did better than all of them together (12pts, 6 assits and 7 rebounds). \n\n4. Ty won't just repeat tonight's strategy and hope for better results. ||4
> Ty won't just repeat tonight's strategy and hope for better results.\n\nHe might. If that game plan is part of what shut down Steph and Klay, he can hope the Warriors bench doesnt go HAM again. Might work. More likely at home than at Oracle though.|[GSW] Latrell Sprewell|1
I would not bet on any of the points you made. I hope and would bet it gets more competitive but GS has a bunch of good match ups with the Cavs. The one thing I think does happen is Lue has the defense better prepared because they look lost at times tonight.||1
*Ty won't just repeat tonight's strategy and hope for better results.*\n\nI just think they are completely overmatched. He rode his starters a lot, if the Warriors keep switching everything they will need to score on postups and isos which they failed to do tonight, I just don't see it. \n\n|Bulls|1
> Ty won't just repeat tonight's strategy and hope for better results.\n\nI'm actually worried about this. The game plan seemed solid against a Curry/Klay offence. If he changes it up, and Curry and Klay actually get back into any kind of decent rhythm, the Cavs might be in trouble again.\n\nBut yeah, this game is so atypical it's going to be hell for Ty to try and make adjustments on.||2
I actually liked how they came at the PnR from both sides. It handled it pretty well. |Warriors|1
Could you maybe go middle of the road though? Adjust to meet the bench better and play a little less defense on klay/curry. Then again i guess that'd just balance out...i really dont know what they'd do to adjust||1
> and play a little less defense on klay/curry.\n\nThis is what I'm worried about. They were both ridiculously cold this game. If they continue being cold, then definitely less D on them might be okay, but if they even go back to normal form I feel like reducing the D on them might end badly.||1
I can see that, to me if you lax on the D for them and they get hot...it won't matter if you heavy the D anymore cause they'll just be kicking it out to them and bam raining threes for days. ||1
 Steph and Klay seemed fairly well defended but at the same time it felt like they had more open looks this game than they did the entire OKC series, just missed a lot of shots that are usually automatic.|Spurs|3
warriors don't have a bench, they have too many starters to play at once.|Heat|6
The cavs got their asses kicked by a warriors team that only had only had one player score 20 points, which was livingston.. \n\nThe NBA seriously needs to somehow reform the whole playoff/finals structure, the current setup is a joke. 9 times out of 10 whoever comes out of the East just gets demolished for the most part (exception for the Lebron Heat) .. this shit is boring. The WCF was the true finals this year. Once again.||3
9 out of 10 times. That's a fact!\n\nSince 1950, the West has 30 titles, the East has 36. In the last 10 years, your stat still remains FACT. West 6, East 4.\n\nIf we're gonnna just forget Lebron's Heat, let's also toss out Kobe's Lakers and Tim's Spurs. Still 9 out of 10 though. Interesting fact.|Pacers|2
You know what? With how Klay saved their asses in game 6 of the WCF and how Curry closed it out in games 5-7, them being carried tonight by their bench just seems fitting.\n\nI mean, they already won the true finals, anyway.|Lakers|4
Okc would dominate the cavs. |Lakers|2

The Warriors just beat the Cavaliers by 15 with Curry scoring 11 and Klay scoring 9 points.\n\nYeah, I'd be shitting my pants if I were Cleveland. |Heat|2
6 of those points came back to back in under 3 minutes to go. Crazy.|Heat|1

Last year was TOTALLY a fluke...amirite?|Warriors|2
If only the Cavs had Kyrie and love...|Trail Blazers|1
Series is not over. Yes there were clear signs of rust from the cavs, huge mental lapses. But the warriors let too many attempts in the paint. It was great they were able to stop almost every layup, but the perimeter d was lacking. To that point, the dubs bench killed even the cavs starters. Iggy and Shaun were insane. So you are probably right ||1
Does R/NBA hate Cleveland unconditionally now because of Delly's dick punch? Or was there something more to the collective hatred of the Warriors? |Supersonics|2
The Finals MVP right now is probably Draymond Green to me. |Warriors|2
DUBS in 5. |Lakers|2
Once again, my theory that the team that scores more points wins holds true|NBA|2
Cavs ball movement is worse than the Thunder's. Cleveland doesn't stand a chance IMO mostly because of their defense. LeBron is the only guy that can defend players. Everyone else is just getting roasted or getting lucky that the Warriors miss pretty open shots. |Warriors|2
This wasn't representative of how the Cavs have played in the playoffs offensively.  They'll adjust.|Kings|1
Actually I think it is. It is just that nobody they have faced thus far had any chance of guarding Lebron or doubling and recovering as quickly as Golden State can\n\n|Warriors|4
No, the Cavs got way to concerned with the taking advantage of the switches instead of just running their offense.  Lebron handled the ball more this game than he has the entire playoffs, he was playing offball more which allowed the Cavs to get easy buckets earlier.  For example, there wasn't 1 Irving/James PnR, which has been one of the most efficient offensive plays in the playoffs.|Kings|0
Not really but enjoy the broom. |Warriors|-1
Not really?  Have you watched the Cavs at all these playoffs?  Don't act like you know what you're talking about.  Did you not see the Cavs trying to force feed Love and Lebron in the post, or ISOing Irving because of a mismatch?  Of course not because you have no idea what you're talking about.|Kings|0
Whatever you want to tell yourself, enjoy the broom. |Warriors|-2
Fucking boring ass game.|NBA|2
Jesus... Steph and Klay didn't even use their cheat codes tonight and they still won by 15. |Spurs|2
This win should be taken as a gift, it was practically handed to them but cavs did not look like themselves. I think it was the defense because warriors closeout on their 3 pt shooters better than any of the east teams Cavs have faced combined, and closing out on Frye practically shuts him down since he can't do anything else. Jefferson/Irving/Love was getting exposed all game. They either have their eye on the ball or keep shadowing Curry/Thompson and leaving one Warrior open for an open dunk. Love is utterly useless in the post and Lue was stupid for keeping on feeding him the ball. Love is too weak to push Iggy and if he had anyone else on him they just double team Love and make him pass after wasting 10 seconds off the shot clock. No swinging the ball outside = no offense for the cavs. Lebron did not look to drive and kick, he wanted to go at them like last year where he was effective in bullying his way to easy layups. Cavs having not faced any real championship quality teams hurt them and was shown. Curry and Thompson were cold, like they shouldn't have even played bad but the warrriors bench torched them. Dellavedova can't keep infront of Barbosa and Irving isn't Waiters so he doesn't have the strength or length to bother Livingston's shot. Cavs need some huge adjusements, maybe play Mozgov in game 2 and a similar lineup to last years finals, but if Cavs lose close to what game 1 was today then the series is over before it started. Kerr has yet to pull out Iggy on the starting lineup where Cavs have never beaten which should be very concerning. |Spurs|2
Y\'all act like the home team running away with a sloppy game 1 has decided the series... Can\'t count the Cavs out until we see how they respond on Sunday, or even until they get back on their home floor. \n\nJust waiting for the mass exodus from "warriors in 5" to "Cavs in 6" when LeBron goes nuclear in game 2, and gets some support from anyone besides Kyrie|Cavaliers|2
Good thing we got the bandwagons flairs ready in r/nba.|Mavericks|1
There\'s this wonderful convergence of "Golden States Bench can\'t do that again" and "Thompson and Curry will be better eventually" and "The Cavs won\'t miss as many easy looks" that really make look forward to the next two games.||1
I'm just saying that shit show told us nothing about where this series is going. Game 2 decides whether CLE steps up or GSW run away with it|Cavaliers|1
And I'm saying this game decided nothing but gave multiple things to look for in the upcoming games.  So we're on the same page.||1
get your popcorn ready \n|Cavaliers|1
Well Steph and Klay played like shit and they still almost blew them out. I can understand why they feel that way.|NBA|1
And K Love / JR did as well. Warriors bench were insane and there's no arguing it, but I'd wager they don't continue the domination throughout the entire series. |Cavaliers|1
So which do you think is more likely...\n\nThe Cavs beat a 73 win team 4/5 the next 5 games, or they win a game 7 at Oracle?\n\nI mean I know Curry and Klay were on fire tonight bu....oh wait. |Bulls|3
> I mean I know Curry and Klay were on fire tonight bu....oh wait.\n\nYeah. This is the scariest thing about this game. Like wtf - the GSW bench just outplayed a Championship finals team.||2
And ppl act like the Barbosa-Livingston duo was lighting up delly, richard jefferson, and daintey jones.\n\nPlenty of Cavs starters were on the floor when the game went sideways on them. |Bulls|2

This just has to be soul crushing for the cavs. They almost shut out the starting line-up only to have the warriors bench come out swinging. Their depth surely showed in this game. People should really not jump the gun (as in game 1 of SA -OKC), but this is not looking good for them.|NBA|2
Soul crushing? dude its one game. I expect if they perform like this in game 2...then yeah, their souls will be crushed.|Heat|1

what? who ever said the cavs' defense is better than the thunder's?||5
Pre playoffs|Thunder|-1
Whoever said Cavs match up better than OKC is a fucking idiot. Cavs do nothing that matchup well with Golden State.|Warriors|5
It's easy to say that now, but before the playoffs people like Bill Simmons and Harbabobolaobo(however the fuck you spell his name) were throwing out narratives about the Thunder defense, how the Clippers were a better team, about that bullshit 4th quarter collapse statistic, and about Billy Donovan being bush league. OKC may not have won the conference, but Sam Presti, Billy Donovan, and the Thunder as a whole got vindicated. |Thunder|0
Maybe if the Warriors sweep it'll force the NBA to re-do conferencing. Idgaf about excuses about travel or whatever, it's 2016 figure it the fuck out.||1

He's injured and just took a few extra heat checks. /s\n\n\n\nIn reality though that dude could come out stand at midcourt and people would circlejerk on how it was the best play ever.||0

Thank you! People keep saying he\'s not going hard at the rim or being aggressive, but they forget that\'s hard to do with the donkey from Shrek and Cory Mathews grabbing your arms and throwing elbows. Then you get "stripped" because the ref isn\'t going to call anything on the Golden Showers, especially in favor of King James. So why would he? \n\n\nDon\'t get me wrong, Cavs would have lost this game even with fair calls. The calls were in favor of the Cavs sometimes (read: rarely) but not nearly to the extent for GSW. \n\n\nAlso, Livingston was a beast, very well done.||1

Goddammit Shaun Livingston!\n\nBut for real of the Warriors bench plays like this the whole series we are fucked. They probably can't, but this is scary. And Klay and Steph didn't even do too much. The Cavs missed and opportunity tonight, gotta shoot at a high percentage than this. Credit to the Warriors D, but the Cavs missed too many shots they should hit.\n\nKyrie was very solid on D, despite the haters saying he'd suck. He missed some shots he should hit though. KLove missed some layups. JR needs more looks. Lebron needs more driving, less posting up. \n\nThe series isn't over, but we gotta shoot better. I don't think Livingston and Barbosa and company can continue to make such well contested shots, but if they do it could be a sweep. Hit shots, continue to contest and we can still do this.|[CLE] Kyrie Irving|1
Kyrie was so bad on D! He kept losing his man on back cuts over and over again ||1

Part of the success of OKC was the ability to have three athletic 7 footers on the floor very frequently. It was the length and quickness of the OKC defense that really disrupted GS. Cleveland, nor any other team really, has that type of roster.|[GSW] Stephen Curry|1
Kevin Love isn't very athletic, but if all goes to hell, hopefully Lue rolls out him, thompson, and frye.  Probably the closest thing|Lakers|1

Trying to be completely objective here - have no horse in any race. I think this goes to show how valuable LeBron is to this team, and I still don't understand how people still don't see that.\n\nYes, Curry is very, very good. But tonight, he just wasn't on. So what happens? The GS bench just balls out and produces, going on a crazy 21-4 run at one point in the 2nd half. Kerr was even fine letting Curry sit deep into the 4th quarter, just because he had faith in his bench. On the other hand, though, when LeBron wasn't on the floor, the Cavs just collapsed. No ball movement, bad shots, defense was rough. Without LeBron, the Cavs wouldn't even be near the Finals.\n\nIn order for Cleveland to win, they're going to need stellar performances from not only Lebron, but KLove, Kyrie, and JR needs to find his shot. For GS, I think it's an easy road to the trophy if Steph gets his shot back. But, even if he doesn't, GS is still looking like they could hold their own.\n\nGoing to be a great series.|Knicks|1

I was Warriors in 6, now I'm downgrading it to 5. Blowouts happen, and I hate r/NBA overreactions, but this game encapsulated a lot of Cleveland's problems. Golden State forced a lot of turnovers and kept Cleveland's offense out of sync. Their bench is obviously deeper. And once they get the 3 going, there's just no way Cleveland can keep up with that. The 3 is so critical in today's game and GS beats you to death with it.|Supersonics|1
Are you guys telling me that adding talent doesn't automatically fix every problem a team has? Kyrie and Kevin were supposed to just add wins no questions asked|Heat|1
Damn. Kyrie got torched tonight|Spurs|1
Shaun Livingstone shot 80% on pretty much all jump shots. Let that fucking sink in.|Spurs|1
Doesn't feels like a finals game to me. I think we've watched them last week. ||1
I for one welcome our new lord and savior Shaun Livingston|Warriors|1
People gonna talk about Klay and Stepg sucking but that's what the Cavs gameplan was. They smother them and let everyone else win it. On the road I think that's a very bad gameplan.|Kings|1
Easy game, Easy life.||1
The Warriors bench is just so much deeper than the Cavs. When a team has so many good players, one or two players having an off night doesn't effect them the way it would effect any other team. Having multiple scorers on a team basically guarantees that at least one of them is gonna get hot.|Heat|1

You know when your bench can play better than the starters on both sides of the court, you're in for a good series. It boggles my mind how the Warriors managed to snag players from NBA hell and get massive production out of them. Spawn Killingston o.m.g. bOnO.|Warriors|1
The real NBA finals happened in the western conference finals with OKC.|Warriors|1
I'm happy for gsw but if curry doesn't get the finals mvp award again I can't take him as an all time great player||1
Hot damn this has got to be the finals record for most players that scored 10+ points by one team, courtesy of the Warriors.|Raptors|1
Besides lebron Cleveland plays like those guys you never wanna play with at the park ||1
So much iso ball it's unbearable, you can see the Kyrie over-dribble, step-back, leaning 18 foot jumper that bricks coming from a mile away, and the rest of the roster is just standing around the perimeter watching him|Suns|2
Let's not overreact. I doubt the Warriors bench will play this well again, even if Curry and Thompson will play better in later games. Remember what happened in the OKC vs Spurs series, and also the OKC vs Warriors series. |Raptors|1

If Steph Curry loses out on another finals MVP to a role player, how do you guys think it'll affect his legacy?|Warriors|1
it won't.  Curry still getting that league MVP, the endorsements, the records, another ring.  People will try to use it to bash him, but then he'll just get another league MVP and everyone will forget again.  Besides, that Thunder series was too epic to forget ||1

Cavs will need big games like they had vs Toronto from their bench. This GS team is just too deep and has too many scoring options when guys like Steph and Klay don't play well. |[NJN] Vince Carter|1
They just need to play teams like Toronto ||1
Cavs were luck to not have Love/Irving last year to get worked on defense.|Knicks|1
Curry & Klay have an awful game, and they still clearly outplay the Cav's with Kyrie & Love in the lineup. No reason why this Warriors team can't do a 3-peat and even better things in the future.|Lakers|1
Curry and Klay only score 20 points combined and that GSW still by 15!! I bet no predicted this would happen.  ||1
They're a better team.  This is academic.  Let's just get to the draft|[LAL] D'Angelo Russell|1
You know when you're Lebron when the MVP sucked balls and he will be highly criticized. \n\nBut yes he does need to step up. 23/12/9 just ain't gonna cut it v. this deep team. He needs to score more. ||1
http://i.imgur.com/l3n9iAK.png||1
The Cavs bench rotation was confusing to say the least imo. Basically no Frye, trying to match GSW small - they will get killed. Imo they need to try and replicate a bit of OKC and go big. Mozgov is still a good player and needs to play actual minutes. Running isn't going to work. Use what you have in TT, Mozgov, Frye and Love. Go super big, why not give minute to some massive lineup like Kyrie/Delly, JR/Shum, Lebron, Love/TT, Frye/Moz|Supersonics|1
Lose by 25 or lose by 1 it's still a loss. You'd think people wouldn't overreact to 1 game after spurs/okc. Cavs will regroup for next game hopefully, everyone could play better.|Cavaliers|1

Warriors played some amazing ball without Klay and Curry tonight. The rest of the team shot 58% and the Warriors had 29 assists to the Cavs 17.|West|1
The story of this game, to me, was the defense. Cleveland is an extremely talented offensive team capable of scoring a lot of points, but it's not going to matter if they keep playing defense like they did tonight. When you're getting roasted by Livingston, Barbosa, and Bought, it does not bode well. The Warriors were completely in control on both ends of the floor and it never once felt like Cleveland was going to win this game. |Warriors|1

You're right,  Lue shouldn't have fielded questions in the first place!|Warriors|3
Leandro Barbosa yo||1
The only thing I can think of is that the Cavs series plan was to hold at home and get a lucky one at Oracle.  So they thought they wouldn't have a chance game 1 @ Oracle and played with that intensity.  The problem is THIS was their lucky one at Oracle where Klay and Curry were cold.  I mean the Cavs were playing well earlier in the playoffs so unless the east really is that bad...|Rockets|1
That didnt work for them last year. It didnt work for OKC. The Cavs were just punchless tonight. I chalk some of it up to rust since they havent played much these playoffs but I doubt they will get another game where both Curry and Klay play so poorly at the same time. This was a golden opportunity for them and they blew it.|[GSW] Latrell Sprewell|1
Some things I took away are J.R. Smith might be a choker in big moments. People have defended him by saying he had to take on bigger roles which I agreed with but today was bad. LeBron on curry changed the game. I wondered why they didn't think about it and bam they made the switch. He roughed up curry and made it hard on screens. Of course Curry shot bad tonight so I want to see if LeBron can do damage when Curry is feeling it. Another thing is Harrison Barnes is gonna get a max this off season. And finally I'm happy that both teams are relatively healthy. ||1
Curry and Klay played like crap and still won\n\nCavs bench really screwed them over|Bulls|1
Kyrie needs to set up his teammates instead of jacking up so many bad shots. They also need to find a way to hide him on defense. So many points were scored on him today. Love and lebron needs to stop missing so many layups, mostly Love though. ||1
Cannot believe no one talking about it, I will ask then. \n\nWas Kevin Love a defensive liability or not? ||1
He wasn't pure shit but he wasn't helpful either. No rim protection, easily managed in PnR, blown by by Barnes a couple times. He doesn't help enough to start him. He could be useful in bench matchups against a guy like Speights.|Warriors|0
He wasn't the disaster everyone predicted, but him being out there compromised their backline D because he does not alter shots in the paint. But it wasn't him getting put on skates every other possession like people were predicting. |Lakers|1
Nah he wasn't that bad, Kyrie on the other hand....||1
Loved played well.  Overall shooting was poor for Cle and the GS bench seriously outplayed the Cle bench.||1
Irving was but not Love. Love was just an average man on defense. |Warriors|2
Shaun Livingston...has been all about...getting...buckets|[LAL] D'Angelo Russell|1

God how I miss Battier.|Cavaliers|1
Cleveland showed they could defend the Splash bros yet let the whole fucking bench GO OFF. If anything they have at least a blueprint in limiting Curry and Thompson. That said, they should absolutely not let their asses get whooped again by the GSW's role players. Important things they could take away from this would be they have what it takes to defend the key guys, their Big 3 can score, and they should not let that beatdown happen again bench-wise.|Cavaliers Bandwagon|1
Pick your poison, give pretty easy shots to everyone else or limit the Splash Bros. They were so focused on making sure those screens don't get open that they just allowed open layups instead. |Warriors|0
> They were so focused on making sure those screens don't get open that they just allowed open layups instead. \n\nWhat?  Did you even watch the game? It was the bench shooting 80% with Steph on the bench that did them in.  No 'Pick your poison' last night; just lights out shooting by a solid bench and the Cavs bench not pulling their own (When the Cavs starters are below their normal efficiency; they shouldn't need 40pts off the bench every night; but they need more than 9)||1
That's great. And there was also Klay Thompson. |Warriors|1
And they scored more when Klay sat also.  Neither Curry or Klay killed us.\n\nLivingston was +20 with Klay and Curry on the bench; that's almost exactly the difference in final score. (+/- is a flawed stat; but illustrative of how the game played out)||1
I guess you didn't see those numerous back cuts but I guess Irving is use to people cheating on him. |Warriors|1
And you used those numerous back cuts to draw even at best, steph was at a negative +/- until garbage time.||1
> And you used those numerous back cuts to draw even at best, steph was at a negative +/- until garbage time.\n\nStill got the W, enjoy the broom. |Warriors|1

Not assholes, just giving u the truth since we are miles better and OKC too. |Warriors|1
umm did you watch the game? How many open layups/ dunks did GS have because of double teams or traps? A lot. Livingston shot lights out because most of his shots were in the paint or around the ft line, areas he doesn't miss from. |Bulls|2
> umm did you watch the game? How many open layups/ dunks did GS have because of double teams or traps? A lot.

Meaning..\n\n>Pick your poison, give pretty easy shots to everyone else or limit the Splash Bros. They were so focused on making sure those screens don't get open that they just allowed open layups instead.\n\nThis is outright wrong.  It wasn't 'easy shots because Curry/Klay attracting attentio'n less they were too busy stairing at them sitting on the bench.\n\nIncluding his late game surge; Steph was +0. All the runs happened while the Splash Bros sat; you can't attribute it to them getting too much attention.||1
There were some easy dunks and layups though from steph getting double teamed. Livingston's shots were made by himself and the fact that no one is tall enough to guard him for sure. Barbosa's shots were also mostly made by himself. So it is true that the bench did most of the work to blow the lead up but even so there were several open layups or dunks from steph curry passes as he was trapped or double teamed. |Bulls|1
I'm confused by all the Steph Curry nut hugging. He played like crap and his team was better when he sat.  Why does that have to be qualified with specific cases anything good that happened when he was on the floor?||1
The problem that I see the Cavs having is Golden State is a complete **team**.  How can you defend a team that can open up a can of kickass from anywhere?|Pacers|3
So if you only watched Game 3 and 4 of OKC-GSW series, your conclusion would be that OKC is a complete **team** and GSW are a bunch of dopes. Is that the extent of your "analysis"?|Heat|2
just basing it from what I watched last night!|Pacers|1

We got our asses kicked, we looked so nervous on the court, especially JR Smith who disappeared. We still have a shot at winning game 2. If we lose, then I think Game 3 will definitely be ours, maybe even game 4. I predicted before the series started that we would most likely be going into game 5 at an even 2-2. |Cavaliers|1
Lol|Heat|1
everyone shittin on the cavs but the narrative will change the second the cavs take a game lol. I'm not complaining though, reactionary discussion is to be expected. |Bucks|1
If you can't beat the Warrior when both Klay and Curry are cold, then you cannot beat the Warriors. This was a huge opportunity missed by the Cavs. The type you do not recover from. |Celtics|1
The Warriors were blown out by the Thunder. This is the playoffs; more specifically The Finals. If you're writing off a team after one game that's na\xc3\xafve and foolish imo|Bucks|2
Yes. When the Warriors best two players got cold the Thunder blew them out. In the same situation the Cavs lost by double digits. Yes, I'm writing them off. Because Steph and Klay are not going to stay cold for long. |Celtics|1
ok. you do you. lol. my point was that lots of people were talking up the Thunder after they won as if they had the series in hand and now everyone is already talking like the Warriors will sweep|Bucks|1
Context matters. It's not like I'm just saying it. I'm pointing out the why. If you can't beat the Warriors when Klay and Steph are both cold, then you are screwed. |Celtics|1
One game is too small of a sample size. It's not like no one on the Cavs had an off night either. Besides I highly doubt they can count on Livingston for 20 each game|Bucks|1
In context the one game tells a huge story. |Celtics|1
What context is that?|Bucks|1
You weren't even reading my comments, were you? Go back and read them. I made it as clear as possible. |Celtics|1
Only 15 minutes for Bogut with no foul trouble. Wonder if he'll even play by the end of the series|Hawks|1
Curry and Klay were ice cold and the Cavs still got beat by double digits? This might be an embarrassing series. When those went cold vs OKC, the Thunder took advantage of it. |Celtics|1
great game, great finals, great 2 teams, quality 1st game, but I think that Thompson and Curry not showed all might,LeBron was good, I think it shows the strength and pull to Cleveland 1-2 games with Irving's partnership!||1
Calm down people, why the hell do you guys even watch if you're already so sure we're going to lose or you're going to complain at every single opportunity given to you? That is the plan, attempt to nullify Curry and Thompson as much as possible and force the other role players to attempt to beat you. They can't maintain that level of shooting. \n|Cavaliers|2

If tonight showed one thing, it is Dubs are a team where Cavs are 1 superstar, 2 good players, and a bunch of other guys.\n\nThe fact some of these guys gave up what they had to be here is awesome.  Why does no one talk about that?  They are so unselfish.  They brag about assists more then points.  Find another team that does that|Warriors|1

Iggys nuts died for this|Warriors|1
Steph is lucky that his bench went crazy tonight or else he would have been criticized so hard. \n\nWarriors are just too good man... what do you do? Steph/Klay have horrible games yet they still win by 15. I don't want to overreact to one game but it's hard not to.\n\nKyrie and Love can't play like this if they want any chance of winning. Also, JR had 3 points? That's pathetic, he should be in the 10-15 range. LeBron did his part and people are still blaming him even though he had 23/12/9. \n\n|Raptors|1
I mean, his bench better have gone off with how much attention him and Klay were getting. There were multiple instances of guys getting wide open shots because of Curry's gravity, so let's not act like he was on the bench the whole time and had no impact. Yes, the bench continued their great play while he wasnt playing, but I think its safe to say that despite not scoring much, Steph had an undeniable impact on the game. He made his teammates better without touching the ball on many occasions, which is what an MVP does|New Jersey Nets|2
Sure Steph & Klay missed some open shots but I think their play tonight was the result of Cleveland doing everything they could to sut them down and force the GS role players to beat them. Cleveland should stay the course and if Livingston, Barbosa and Barnes continue to play like this then they just gotta throw their hands up and accept this is the deepest team of all time |[DAL] Dirk Nowitzki|1
I agree, even when Steph and Klay got open looks, they seemed out of rhythm. Some of it I'd say is being cold, but the defense also gets credit.|Warriors|1
They missed pretty good looks so no. |Warriors|2
Thunder blew out the Dubs in two straight and the Dubs still pulled it out. I see this being a tight series still, but only if Kyrie and the bench can get it together.|Supersonics|1
The splash brothers were Magikarp & Feebas today...\nLiterally, "SPLASH" brothers...|Timberwolves|1

[>mfw someone says that the Warriors would suck without Klay and Steph](http://cache3.asset-cache.net/gc/498962826-draymond-green-and-stephen-curry-of-the-gettyimages.jpg?v=1&c=IWSAsset&k=2&d=X7WJLa88Cweo9HktRLaNXgWvADBFy4SYykSkl5uY8S7jm1vd1RiOpLw2cLrOeQw9RtGb15ir%2Flg1t6I1C24A2b6pMrLb4PUtqy7UedV5WgiP6KanedgYTllE5Xr8lXID)|Warriors|1
If the Cavs converted even half of their layup  misses this is an entirely different game. Of course you can always say that about something but still. |Cavaliers|1
GSW bench won't play that good again, but Curry and Klay won't be that quiet again. Lebron and Love missed a couple layups in the 3rd just before GSW went on that run that would have totally changed the game. Intriguing.|Magic|1
Though we lost soundly, the game tonight makes me optimistic. This series is going to be a classic.\n\nK Love looks to have taken the endless media jabs against him personally or is stepping his game up in the championship. He looked locked in from minute 1. Not only offensively, but his defense was better than I thought him capable. He's gotta work on getting the ball out when the Warriors double him in the post, but movement around the arc will make that much, much easier or force GSW to stop doubling.\n\nKyrie Irving's midrange shot was off tonight. Looked like he had a black eye or something, though  I'm not using it as an excuse. Just looked like something was going on with his right(?) temple/eye. He had a good game regardless and I think is taking it personally that Curry is talked about being in a different league from him.\n\nThe Cavs gameplan seems to be on point defensively, just needs some polishing with communicating switches and such. The offense needs to get away from iso and get some motion when the post is doubled, which the Warriors seem to have committed to, especially against Love.\n\nThe Fuck Draymond train might need to pull into the station. I thought there were a couple moments a lot of players would have lost it, especially when LBJ jumped on him, but I thought he was a pretty class act out there compared to what I perceive to be his norm with arguing with refs and childish on-court behavior.\n\nAnd, of course, LBJ was LBJ.|Cavaliers|1
LeBron got to rest all playoffs. Time to play 48|[OKC] Kevin Durant|1
Can't expect the entire Cavs roster to fall flat this entire series. Game plan was there, we showed we can control the tempo and make things difficult for Curry & Thompson... Lots of overreactions here - as expected, but if there's some contribution from the bench & Livingston/Barbosa come back down to earth I think we have an interesting series. \n|Cavaliers|1
I think it's hard to expect that Curry and Thompson will only combine for 20 points going forward||3
Guarantee the GSW bench doesn't outscore the Cavs' by 40 again. Thompson could very well disappear and Curry was smothered when LeBron covered him. Stay tuned. |Cavaliers|1
Kinda disrespectful to play Channing during garbage time. Why the fuck did he play him for so little? He doesn't need much space to hit threes and he only got one attempt in...|Trail Blazers|1
The dude can't create shit on offense and is a defensive liability. It's hard for Lue to keep him in there|Cavaliers Bandwagon|1
The dude played like a total of three minutes (excluding garbage time), at the end of quarter one and two. Is that really enough of a time period to decide to not play him any further? These whole playoffs, he never needed to create. LeBron drives, dishes, and he has a wide open three. He even hits the contested shots since he's a 7 footer with a high release.|Trail Blazers|1
i've seen a lot of people ask and i've not seen an answer. i feel like i must've missed something when i was streaming the first half. why did he not play?||2
The answer is gonna be "liability on defense" and "not good at rebounding" for the most part. Livingston going off on the smaller defenders, wouldn\'t have hurt to at least try to bring him in for defending him. But they played him for only like 3 minutes, attempted one three then the next stop he was out.|Trail Blazers|1
got it. it's just, he looked like a fucking sniper in the last series, so i thought he'd be a bigger factor. thanks for your thoughts!||3
He still is, just didn't give him a chance this game. He only played at the end of the first and second quarter with like a minute and two minutes left. His stroke is silky smooth, looks like it's going in all the time, doesn't it?|Trail Blazers|1
To be honest outside of just recently he'd been really average. |76ers|3
Can't get those 3s off when there's players who can close out. Can't drive or post because he's not that kinda player. Can't play defense. Can't rebound\n\n|[OKC] Kevin Durant|5
JR had one thing on him tonight, defense. His high release, it doesn't really matter if he gets closed out on. Evidence is in these whole playoffs. Very lethal, even with someone on him. Livingston was going off on all the smaller defenders, so I wouldn't have minded seeing a bigger guy in there to clog some of the mid to paint area.|Trail Blazers|2
Steph and Klay: ICEBOX|Warriors|1
Probably going to be one of the more boring finals. GSW in 4 or 5 easily.|Bucks|1
What more can BronBron do in this situation? I'm asking as a real question, cuz even though the Cavs looked outmatched, he still put up a near triple double|Cavaliers Bandwagon|1
He wasn\'t very efficient tonight. I think he only had one point in the 2nd qtr, and somehow only got to the line 4 times (although he was getting hammered around the rim). Irving shot 7/21, that ain\'t gonna cut the mustard, and JR "Swish" was 1 of fucking 3 in 36 minutes. It was a horrible game offensively for the Cavs. ||1
Jesus Christ this take gave me pancreatic cancer. LeBron not being very efficient with the 23/12/9.||0
He also had four TOs and shot less than 50% from the field. I'm not putting this L on his shoulders in anyway but he was not at his best tonight. JR Smith, Tristan Thompson, Dellavadova (-19 tonight) need to take a good hard look in the mirror and bring it on Sunday. ||0
Only LeBron is accused of a less than efficient night for shooting "less than 50% from the field." ||1

Post up.|Knicks|2
Hit the outside shot to make the D respect his range, thus opening up driving lanes. Driving and kicking is more effective than posting up and trying to swing the ball around after a double or a dig. |Lakers|2
I think Lebron needs another hug (or maybe kiss) from Drake after that loss! http://i.imgur.com/DeLzu32.jpg ||1
Well, this is why the Warriors broke the best record ever in the NBA. They are a GOOD team. I am confident, however, the Cavs will bounce back and at least make this series interesting|Bucks|1

I'm still rooting for the meteor.|Spurs|1
Cavs were out coached, therefore out played.||1
From a Warriors fan to the Cavs fan: If Cavs really can't win or at least not lose by double digits when both Curry and Thompson are playing shit... I don't know what's your excuse... I mean besides the Cavs Big 3, no one is scoring...||1
Steph Curry and Klay Thompson were nowhere to be found tonight. \xf0\x9f\x98\x82||-2

I've been a Warriors fans for years\n\n\nI still found myself asking who the fuck is Barbossa and why is he making shots.|Warriors|-2
You're embarrassing the actual loyal warriors fans. Barbossa was crucial on those Suns teams. Dude developed the reputation for being one of the fastest players in the league.|Mavericks|7

God damn are you stupid. ||2
Seriously though the refs taking like 15min to discuss that Delly / Iggy accidental incident was complete bullshit, when the hell does that ever happen? Just killed all energy and momentum that we had because we finally game back and then all of a sudden GSW goes on a 15-2 run again...|Cavaliers|-11
haha|Raptors|3
too many excuses....|Warriors|6
Ahhhhhh, shut up.|Warriors|11
It was a matter of turnovers and the warriors bench players having career setting games.  CLE TOs: 17 GS TOs: 9.  Livingston was making shots he'll never make again.  And the biggest X factor in the loss for the Cavs was this:  JR Smith's stat line:  3 pts, 1 ast, 1 reb, 0 steals,  THIRTY SIX FUCKING MINUTES.  Yeah, the warriors bench played so well, they'll never play that well again, but JR Smith, man... holy shit.|Cavaliers|-9
He also was never open. Outside LeBron a couple times, the Cavs had very few open 3s. The Warriors basically did what Toronto wanted to do at the start of the ECF but it actually worked. |Bulls|2
Yeah, but being open hasn't really limited JR in the past.  He takes contested 3s. That's his thing.|Cavaliers|-1
The ball also didn't move to him as much because the way the Warriors were forcing the Cavs into isos. |Bulls|2
Yeah Ima have to argue with that, GSW bench had a stellar game, and they can definitely do it again. They've got the deepest bench in the series \n||3
>Livingston shooting 80% \n>doing it again\n\nYou failed to remember that the best scoring lineup in the playoffs this year was LeBron + 4 cavs bench players.  They won't have a no show like this again.|Cavaliers|-2
I didn't say anything about the cavs bench. All I said was the Warriors bench is very consistent, and it's not ridiculous to expect another good performance from them||1
their also playing a team who is just a weeeeee bit better defensively than anybody they've faced so far. |Warriors|2
You've obviously never watched the Warriors, their bench steps up all the time this is nothing new. |Thunder|10
They had career setting games.  Do you understand what that means?  They played the best they ever have.  Ever.  You don't have career setting games every game. You've obviously never watched basketball.|Cavaliers|-8
Livingston had his first 20 point game of his career and will never make this shots again? Riiiight|Thunder|1
Livingston is so deadly from midrange. His bread and butter. ||2
guess you missed the Portland series. Specifically the games when Livingston started. |Warriors|2
if you think livingston will never make those midrange jumpers again, you're crazy. he might not make them as frequently as he did tonight, but that is His Shot. (and if that was your original point, my bad for misinterpreting.)||5
So many idiots in the game thread pointing to Curry and Klay having a bad game and still winning by a large margin as a reason why GS is overrated. That tells you the level of competition East vs West.|Warriors|0
Shit that's gotta be demoralizing getting tore up by the bench like that when the splash bros didn't show up.|Celtics|0
Holy shit we have such a deep bench. Klay and Curry didn't even get a combined 30|Warriors|0
This is a bad matchup for the Cavs. They don't have much of a shot IMO barring injuries on the Warriors. \n\nWarriors in 5. Cavs will get a lucky game. |Warriors|0
This sub overreacts so hard to every game. It's game 1.|Cavaliers Bandwagon|0
game one and the bench wrecked the cavs without breaking a sweat.  really, the other games the teams have played also provide intel on the situation.  it's over.|Heat|3
GS looked like they had a nice spa day in the locker room at halftime. Kerr broke his clipboard and they kinda responded.  Deli had a ball punch, in where his hand was never within 2 feet of Iggy\'s hands and got a common foul.  GS responded then. Make them feel wronged, they might just start the season with a record winning streak, or smoke you with their backup players in the 4th. \n\nCorrection, Smoke the East\'s "best team" in the 4th with their backups. |Warriors|0
If their big 3 have that bad of a game and the Cava still lose that is not a good sign |Charlotte Hornets|0
Draymond had a great game. |76ers|2
Am I wrong in thinking Lebron  has always had crap benches? I remember them talking about bench production when the Spurs dismantled them in 2014. Like why dont they get rid of one of the "big three" to build up a better bench. |Spurs|0
Because LeBron is not that good at being a GM. He might be the best player GM we've seen, but the two jobs have too much coutnering each other for one man to do both. It's kind of amazing that he won with the Heat. He must have actually listened to Pat Riley a little. You can tell because Spoelstra never got fired. |Celtics|1
When "The LeBrons" have one of the best records in the league, his team has depth and they\'re great and he brought in what he needs. When he loses in the finals, his team sucks and he has no help and and and....\n\n\nPeople need to figure out which one it is.|Trail Blazers|2
Because then they don't get to the Finals at all|Heat|3
Yeah, they needed everyone to get over that Celtics hump last season|Mavericks|1
Toronto would have beaten them this year if Cavs had one less superstar for them to worry about. The only way to consistently get to the Finals is to have 3 bona fide stars and hope at least 2 of them go off in every game. When you only have 2, you pretty much need both of them to always go off.|Heat|0
"This year" "only way" "have 3 bonafide stars"\n\nWhoosh, man|Mavericks|0
Man Kyrie was getting exposed on Pick N' Roll, and off-ball screens. Looked like James Harden out there on defense.|Hawks|0

Hope your kidding. Curry's the main reason his teammates get open shots.|Knicks|9

*"I don\'t care about trying to take LeBron\'s throne or trying to be the face is the NBA. I\'m here to chase rings."* - Stephen Curry|[GSW] Andre Iguodala|5
As longtime lebron fan im very annoyed that he doesnt shoot at all anymore.\n\nFuckin shoot it dude your lebron. I know his shot isnt the best but hes fuckin lebron.....\n\nI hate his  zen just happy to be here attitude. He has the body and skills to score 40 a night, but he plays like a soft bitch most of the time.\n\nCome the fuck on||-6
His shooting is terrible||1
Well then he shouldnt be in the nba.||1
Warriors would love for him to shoot a lot more. His jump shot has declined badly |Heat|2
I feel you dude. I really wanted to see him play with the hunger he played with last finals. |[PHI] Tony Wroten|2
His number is more broke than the last dude you had hitting you up for change. Warriors will take him jump shooting all night. |76ers|2
Curry definitely needs to step up his game in this finals. Even the schedule isn't that tough and he's got enough of a rest. If the warriors wins the series and Curry misses the finals MVP 2 years in a row, some people are going to try to tarnish his legacy just for that reason. It won't do any good for his career when he seriously gets compared to other all-time greats later on.||-5
Who give a fuck, it's all about winning the ship. If curry gets doubled hard all series I'm sure he would gladly pass the ball out to a 4 on 3 cake bucket every possession en route to ring number two.|[GSW] Tom Gugliotta|10
Who gives a fuck?A lot of fans, reporters and experts do. Imagine where Shaq would be in the all-time ranking if he didn't get those three final MVPs. It could be worse for Curry; I mean he barely scored 11 points with a FG% of .27 and even had 5 turnovers tonight; he definitely needs to do a lot better than that.||-6
You're putting a lot of weight into shit that very few people fucking care about. Dude won back to back Mvps and if they win this series he will have won back to back ships. Winning is everything, and that's all that any reasonable person gives a shit about.|[GSW] Tom Gugliotta|2
In what parallel universe is getting a finals mvp only few people care about? Most likely in your make-believe world only. In reality what people remember in the end are the numbers you put up and the awards you receive. Would Jordan still be labeled as the goat if it was Pipen who won all those six finals mvps? Guess what people would think of Lebron if he never managed to win those two finals mvps because Wade had always been the one carrying the team in the finals series. Would people even compare him with other all-time top10 greats? No way. The same goes for Curry; if he misses this time again, he will be considered as a guy who somehow never manages to come through in the biggest games of the season and probably be one of the few players, if not only player, who won back to back mvps and championships without a single finals mvp in the history of NBA.||0
All I care about is titles. I don\'t think any reasonable person who watched Curry or Jordan or LeBron would take anything away from them if they win championships, but not Finals MVPs.  Only people who are more concerned with stats than actual game impact can say, "oh, well Steph got doubled like fucking crazy for an entire series and his team won the Championship because of it, but since he didn\'t accumulate the most stats in a Finals series and win the Finals MVP, it doesn\'t mean shit". Get real. If Steph wins back to back regular season MVPs and back to back finals while his team goes 73-9 you\'d have to be an out and out retard to try to detract from that.|[GSW] Tom Gugliotta|1
I told you ;)||1
yeah but curry would gladly have a ring over a finals mvp.  cavs sending 2-3 guys to chase steph w/o the ball freed up others for easy buckets||2

Lebron needs more help, this isn't his fault he needs a better bench too||-7
No, he needs GSW to be not as good. ||3
JFC. I am sick of seeing this every damn year for Lebron. This is the team HE wanted. They are healthy. Its the coach HE wanted. This is one of the best supporting casts hes had according to 538 http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/lebron-and-the-rest-of-the-cavs-are-better-this-year/ They have enough talent, shooting, and depth. Its a flexible and potent lineup. The issue isnt help, its the system, gameplan and chemistry. He built this team, those things are on him.\n\nAll that said they will be better in game 2, but this excuse has to go. |Lakers|13

How am I making excuses for lebron lol? Also the warriors took the thunder to 7, not the other way around.|Hawks|2
Ah, sorry I'm preparing for the hordes of redditors with calculators |Minneapolis Lakers|0
Game was decided early on by a 1st quarter of trash officiating. \n\nPrediction - Game 2 will be a lot of the same. I predict early touch fouls on TT, lots of inside (uncalled) contact on Lebron, and at least 5 bad "judgement calls" (OOB, possession) all going against the Cavs in the first half. At the end of the half, there will be a few non-shooting fouls against non-critical GS players to "even" the calls out a little bit. By then, CLE will be crippled enough that the 2nd half will be more evenly called.\n\nGame 3 will be a flip. The Cavs will get the majority of calls to bring the series to 2-1. \n\nGame 4 - Majority of calls go back to GS. They take a 3-1 series lead. \n\nGame 5 and 6 (yeah right)are called legitimately. With the title already in hand, GS is given a chance to win their 4th of the series on their own.\n\nIf it gets to 7 (no chance in hell), the NBA will seal the deal on the *best season ever*.  |Pacers|-8
