The 2016 NBA Finals are still the only finals in history to have every game decided by double digits.|Thunder|1564
Didn't the Warriors only win by 9 in game 4? Or am I misremembering?|Cavaliers|2
Won by 11|Thunder|6
Ok, mybad|Cavaliers|2
Well that last game was closer but then the ft game started at the end|Pacers|4
It's actually kind of boring too.\n\nAll the series drama has been outside the games and mostly on twitter.|Heat|152
Dumb comments are dumb|Cavaliers|0
It was going to be a boring 4-1 finish today anyways if the NBA didn't want to keep milking Lebron the cash cow.|Thunder|0
The ends of the games have been boring, but the games themselves have been pretty good for the most part, and today's game was dead even through the first half and still close through the third quarter.|[CLE] Lebron James|1
Last two games were decent up until half way through the 4th but one side struggles to score and the other ran it up quick. |Raptors|1
Today's game was interesting. It became a double digit lead later on in the game not right at the start.|Raptors|2
How was it boring? It was still a 5 point game in the fourth...|Lakers|3
Didn't feel like it? It's just my opinion. Despite what the actual numbers were this series hasn't been competetive to the final buzzer once.|Heat|-1
I can see that. My point was that through 3.5 quarters the game was close and within 5 towards the end|Lakers|2
It's exciting for the casual fans though.\n\nOMG Dray called LeBron a bitch? Klay said LeBrons feelings got hurt?\n\n> Tune in this Sunday SUNDAY SUNDAY FOR THE BIGGEST SHOWDOWN IN NBA HISTORY\n\nShit is like the Real housewives or some shit. |Raptors|82

I don't know man, I love the NBA and basketball not because of narratives and trash talking. I love how a perfectly executed play is like poetry in motion. I love how seeing a small orange ball falling through a hoop 10 feet in the air can bring millions of people pure joy or sadness. I don't care for the extraneous he said she said games. |Raptors|1
Same here man. Watching it for the technical stuff is awesome||1
No it isn't. What's good for all fans is close games. If you're tuning out every 4th quarter it isn't good for anyone |NBA|2
Sunday SUNDAY **SUNDAY**! Real hardcore shots from Lebron Curry Dray Irving AND MORE! You don't want to miss this EXTRAVAGANZA!\n\n*engines revving* |Nuggets|3
And I fucking hate it. I watch sports for the games. Not some bitchy storyline. I'd watch wwe otherwise. (No disrespect to wwe and /r/squaredcircle)|Cavaliers|5
Did you see this sub this week? So ridiculous lol|Jazz|9
Honestly, I didn't think tonight's game was boring at all. I felt like the Warriors were perpetually on the cusp, about to strike, about to even it out and maybe even swoop the lead right back. I was tense. Without Kyrie and Lebron's heroics, the Warriors win this one. It was exciting. |[MIN] Ricky Rubio|400
Why dont you take your bandwagoning ass somewhere else.  Warriors lost by 15.  That is proof enough that your lord and savior Curry isn't all he is cracked up to be.  Fuck off.||0
Do you like basketball?|[MIN] Ricky Rubio|2
Yea, to think you need these kinds of performances from LeBron & Kyrie plus no Draymond green to win, it doesn't look good for the Cavs. |Grizzlies|1
Agreed. When the Warriors were only down ~7-8 in the 4th, I was just waiting for them to drain a couple of 3s, steal the momentum and win the game. |Cavaliers|1
I'm was good till the 4th. Then it was boring. That's when it's supposed to be the most suspenseful. |NBA|1
With every Warriors loss I feel like they are just about to come back the whole time. They just reign 3's obviously and almost use none of the shot clock when they have to save time.||1
Yeah I thought so too until about 3 minutes left when LeBron hit that ridiculous, falling, and 1 to go up by 16. I went "whelp, that\'s it."|Celtics|1
yup exactly||1
99% agreed ||3
All those missed 3s towards the last 6 minutes ughhh||5
Without LeBron and Kyrie, the Cavs scored like 30 points tonight lol|Rockets|4
The warriors disappeared in the second half. They went 3+ minutes without scoring at one point. It wasn't like Cavs defense was hot at that point either they missed so many wide open looks it was just frustrating.\n\nPoor play from one team but Kyrie did keep the game watchable with his unstoppable shooting from hard spots.|Heat|4
This really felt like a close game even though we were perpetually down 7-9 points. Props to James and Kyrie. They played incredibly|Warriors|42
*incredibly well.\n\n"incredibly" is an adverb||1
Yeah, my butt is still clenched. Maybe that's because I need to shit, though.|[CLE] Tristan Thompson|3
That's because you guys have so many 3 point threats that you can turn a 9 point lead into a 1 possession game in less than a minute. It's terrifying.|Raptors|19
Yes, which is why I don't understand why GS didn't try to foul and extend the game at the end, like, at all.||1
This really was the closest game through 3.5 quarters too.|Lakers|501
2.5 really. Bogut went out and the Cavs feasted at the rim.|Spurs|16
Bogut had only played 8 mins up to that point. I don't really believe that was THE difference. |Grizzlies|1
The difference was kyrie and lebron not missing jumpers and OMG will the cavs trade love already!?||2
Eh not as much as I thought they would.  Kyrie and LeBron's jumpers were just not missing anything.|Warriors|28
Notice that the Warriors weren't really bodying/running guys from outside. Their best choice for most of that second half was to take a chance with jumpers when they have no defensive presence in the paint.\n\nLebron definitely had a crazy shooting night but strong defensive centers are the rock upon which Warriors defense is built upon. |Spurs|9
Strong defensive centers and Draymond's switchability. Will be interesting to see what the Warriors can trot out in lieu of Bogut next game... Ezeli? Eeeesh.|[GSW] Adonal Foyle|5
Is Bogut out for the next game?|Heat|2
Even if he only sprained ligaments, he'd be out for the rest of the series.  I'd bet it's worse than that based on the replay.  I am personally assuming he's out for the series until they say something otherwise |NBA|2
Ouch. Too bad.|Heat|2
Wasn't G4 like 6. With half a quarter to play? I honestly was too rattled/drunk to remember when I knew it was over |[CLE] Matthew Dellavedova|9

I have a feeling we are going to be seeing this photo a lot on this sub in the future.\n\nOn a serious note, this picture actually reminds me that Kevin Love played as hard on defense tonight as I've ever seen him play. His offensive game was non-existent, but for someone without much defensive talent, he gave a great effort. Particularly when he had to play PnR defense against Curry.||14

Valiant performance from Anderson Varejao considering he lost the same ear twice in the span of five minutes.|Mavericks|1397
I loved listening to Van Gundy just ripping into him about that hahaha|Cavaliers|1
That guy is softer than a rabbit pissing on cotton |Celtics|1
Varejao is a disgrace to the game||1
funniest thing would be AV losing in the finals to CLE :D||1
i laughed out loud at him being in "So much pain" rolling around on the ground, but his hands broke his fall gracefully before clutching that so injured ear ... haha the man IS a pro flopper!|Lakers|1
He was being praised here as a super awesome dude a couple of weeks ago. I couldn't believe my eyes. r/nba is such a bandwagon place.||2
I always love how fucking pumped Varejao gets any time he actually does something good.  Irving showed less emotion hitting his 80 threes than Varejao did getting that out of bounds play|Warriors|2
He's just happy he got to Gogh to the finals|[MEM] Marc Gasol|3
Don't forget about his back||3
It's that hair and soccer background for him. That's what makes the flopping special. He knows how to take a dive and milk it for all it's worth. |Magic|3
as a super casual fan, he is everything I hate about watching the nba||6
He's a straight clown. It would be justice if the league reviews some of the plays and slaps him with a fine. |Supersonics|7
He should have gotten an Oscar for that, he made it look like JR stabbed his ear|Timberwolves|10
Terrible calls by the refs on a known flopper. Nobody likes to see that. But he played fairly smart all told, considering it kept working out. That one rebound in the 4th that he snagged from Tristan and threw off his leg and out of bounds was almost a momentum changer. Only down by 6 at that point, but kyrie and lebron....damn|Warriors|104
I hate seeing players flop more than anything else. It'll turn into soccer if we keep rewarding it. I love things like the nhl that call a penalty on a flop/dive||7
I think the teams are incredible, but it's like this Finals is a test of acting acumen. Curry, Lebron flopping fucking everywhere. Not to mention their role players.\n\n\nI think the NBA goes nuclear after this series and calls for flops to be reviewable & also calls them fouls.||2
Exactly and my friends always tell me curry don't flop and he get fouled on all his shots.  I keep telling them curry likes to shoot and just randomly fall down||1
I think the way to really stop flopping is reviewing and handing out suspensions instead of fines. They dont give a shit about $25k but missing a big game would make them think twice||3
Maybe even call it a foul and play it on the tv and award a technical if you're caught. I think public shaming would do it||7
Man, stop hating on the dude. He has a condition where his ear's pain receptors are located on his shoulder. Trust me, am neuroscientist.||181
I can confirm. I'm not neuroscientist but I did stay at a Holiday Inn Express. ||10
You forgetting when the 7 footer got knocked down by mighty delavadova bumping into him. ||62
He threw himself over Delly and grabbed his jersey, pulled Delly in and flopped. |Cavaliers|7
So annoying to watch his stupid acting. ||524
I loved Andy. Now I'm quickly realizing why everyone hates him. |[CLE] Matthew Dellavedova|1

I think Varejao spent half of his minutes flailing like a fish out of water. The man is a professional flopper, never have I seen a 7 foot tall GIANT of a man spend so much time pretending to be knocked over by people he has at least 100 or so pounds on|[MIA] Dwyane Wade|285
 Lol that's pretty funny considering you guys had Varejao's star pupil LeBron on your team for a couple years.|Lakers|-9
You guys? And even if I was a Cavs fan , it doesn't mean I'm obligated to like any old players. I'm sure Warriors fans wouldn't like it if Dray pulled his shenanigans against their team if he was on another team|[MIA] Dwyane Wade|4
I enjoy imagining Green nut punching Varejao. |Cavaliers|3

Perhaps nautical nonsense be something he wished!|NBA|1

I heard that Barnes will be paid for $20m per year this summer \xe2\x80\xa6 does he deserve the price?||1
Is it just me or is Harrison Barnes been the definition of mediocre? I mean, 2/14? That is an absolute dumpster fire. Ever since that injury he hasn't looked like a max player. |[TOR] DeMar DeRozan|0
That's being extremely generous.|[ATL] Pete Maravich|2
Barnes doesn't deserve anything close to the max contract he will certainly get|Spurs|2
Same if it was with Steph and Klay, just for a different reason. |Warriors|2
Who ever loses gets the max contract |Cavaliers|2
Thats Harrison "Max Contract" Barnes for you.|76ers|16

You trust speights to make a layup?|Bulls|2

You guys are brutal. Did you see his last two games?  Dude was great.||3
He's done pretty good in most of the playoff games I've watched. Maybe I've only watched his good ones :/|Timberwolves|3
Seriously, what the hell was he doing? Chuckin up bricks left and right, standing around on the defensive end, generally contributing *nothing* to the team. Nothing. He may as well have taken the ball and just handed it over to the Cavs every time in the 2nd half.|Timberwolves|1
You can't be hot from three all the time. He had to take every single shot he took. The coach and his team mates would have been angry at him if he didn't. He made the right play all night, he just wasn't ridiculously hot like you guys are most of the time. |Thunder|1
Its funny how no matter how bad the w's might be from the 3 in the game they can just turn it on and hit the next 5 in a row||1
It sucks but he showed heart man. I know that's lame but he was fighting and shooting the right shots and it just didn't work out for him. It's a tough position to be in for him with Draymond out and then Bogut getting hurt.|Cavaliers Bandwagon|1
Specially the four wide open 3p he missed in the 4th|Celtics|2
towards the end they were just letting him get open and just turning around to rebound, he was shooting terribly|76ers|4
He had to have missed like five wide open threes. |76ers|7
Nail in the coffin was the open 3 off an inbounds down 7.  Instead clank!\n\nI guess the silver lining is the Cavs still gave up tons of open looks....|Warriors|7
They were leaving him open ready for the orebs lmao. They knew hb was gunna clank em|Warriors|1
those two back to back missed wide open threes... ugh |Warriors|145
What about Curry, also the fact that he tries way too hard to be fancy with the ball for random unforced turnovers is dumb. \n\nGSW has been setting records in the regular season, post season, and there is a good chance that the back to back two time regular season MVP will not be the the finals MVP.||10
Who gives a fuck. Warriors wining one more game is all any dubs fans should care about. People care way too much about these individual accomplishments, FMVP should not be that big a deal. hanging banners is the only thing that matters at the end of the day, and we're in good shape to get another. |Warriors|6

You and I have a very different definitions of elite. He is a valuable role player with a hard to find skill set but he isn't even close to elite. |Knicks|1
Right? Ironic that in a thread where the top comment is everyone shitting on r/nba for being reactionary, it only takes the next comment down for people to suggest this kid's gonna lose a contract for one off shooting night.|Warriors Bandwagon|1

CLE needs to trade that nerd|Grizzlies|36
Stop, he is a man|Bulls|0
Boston would be glad to have him!\n\nBut I doubt they'll let him go. They traded Wiggins for him, getting rid of him now would leave a lot of egg on their faces--it'd be especially awkward for GM/President/Coach/Co-Owner LeBron.\n\nBest option for them would be to try and flip him for Blake Griffin (imo). Both teams seem a bit disgruntled with their all-stars. But that's just from the outside looking in. Maybe it's not as bad as it's made out to be?|[BOS] Kevin Garnett|6
I was thinking Griffin might be a good swap as well|[CLE] Mark Price|5
Durant would also be a good trade as well \n\n\n\n/s |[CHI] Steve Kerr|2
Why would the Clips do this? \n|Hawks|11
Full shakeup. CP3 + Griffin for Kyrie + KLove. Cavs can throw in a wing too because that's what the Clippers actually need. \n\n|Lakers|2
Clippers would be lucky to get 45 wins. Kyrie stats with Love are not great, and it is pretty clear he can't run an offense for a full season. \n\nhttp://www.basketball-reference.com/players/l/loveke01/lineups/2016/ \n\nLook at the two mans with Irving and Delly. They are more efficient by most stats.|Celtics|2
Cleveland would do that in a second. No idea why Clippers would do that. ||21
Blake and Lebron on the same team would be fun as hell to watch.||10
After he broke his hand a lot of stuff came out about how the team doesn't like him. And last year a really big deal was made about Chris Paul hating Blake. \n\nMichael Wilbon, Stephen A. Smith, and Bill Simmons have talked about the animosity on the team. And when he was out for that long stretch the Clippers played their best basketball of the season.\n\nThe main reason they'd make the trade would be if the animosity in the locker room is as strong as it's being made out to be (and not being overblown by the media as these things often are). Blake would flourish under Chris Paul and Doc. A pass first PG that'd feed him whenever he looked even half open would make him a huge part of the offense which he's been complaining about since he went to CLE. So I think Love would be very open to the trade as well.|[BOS] Kevin Garnett|11
Deandre would have the whole paint too with love outside.  Doesn't help clips because their issue is lack of movement in crunch time. Don't see love improving movement, just spacing.  ||1
Wiggins would fit in perfect|Warriors|44
I still think they shouldn't have traded Wiggins , dudes talent level doesn't have a peak yet, we have no idea how good he's going to become, could fizzle out in a few years, could become a top 10 player ||-4
That's the joke||0
Trade looks a lot worse in retrospect with loves inability to fit in, wiggins development, and the okc like matchup nightmare wiggins would have been for gsw|Warriors|2
Probably because LeBron knows he doesn't have time to help develop a potential running mate. He knows he has a narrowing window to cement his legacy so he bet on Love since he was already established as a top 20 player (arguably top 10 in Minnesota). 5 years from now Wiggins might be the next face of the NBA but LeBron doesn't have the luxury of waiting to find out.|[BOS] Kevin Garnett|13
> he doesn't have time\n\n???\n\nLebron was 30 at the time. Jordan was 35 when he won his last championship.\n\nDon't forget that Wiggins would've been on a Rookie scale as well. That leaves more $$$ to sign depth which is arguably just as important to the Cavs atm. Lebron alone is already enough to coast to the Finals in the East. With Kyrie and a young Wiggins + more depth, that's definitely just as good as the current Cavs team.\n\nAnd nobody can deny that Love is a much better contributor atm when compared to only Wiggins, but they effectively traded away that extra depth they would've gotten from Wiggins' cheaper deal along with the ability to have a third potential superstar (*top 20 doesn't cut it as a superstar*) locked up until at least 2021.\n\nI could definitely see 35-36 year old Lebron competing with a prime Kyrie and a 23 year old hyper-athletic Wiggins. |Knicks|0
Fair enough, but LeBron relies heavily on his physicality to be dominant. He's been in the NBA since HS so he's got Kobe-esque mileage on his body as well. Kobe and Jordan could adapt to old age well because they worked on their post moves and could post up smaller guards. LeBron has been moving out of the post since he left MIA and even when he does post-up, it's against PFs/Cs and that kind of banging wears you thin. LeBron's on the back-end of physical prime already. So it's not a guarantee he could maintain his athletic playing style while waiting for Wiggins to develop.\n\nIt's also not fair to treat Wiggins like a sure thing. In hindsight it seems pretty obvious, but there's always the chance he turned out to be another Michael Beasley or Derrick Williams. Gauging rookie potential is a crapshoot.\n|[BOS] Kevin Garnett|2
He's better right now, by the looks of it, and would have been a nightmare matchup for the warriors. Of course, when the trade happened none of this was even remotely foreseeable (gsw and small ball lineups consisting of athletic wings, and out course wiggins development)|Warriors|0
His last year in MN he was absolutely a top 10 player and the best PF in the game.|Timberwolves|4
Yep, I thought he was definitely top 10 in MIN. But people have differing opinions, so I used "arguably" in case someone made the case I overlooked someone else.|[BOS] Kevin Garnett|2
That sounds like the reason they traded him|Clippers|37
Wiggins is pretty nerds too.|[POR] Maurice Harkless|4
*hindsight*||6
Lol I feel like you called him a nerd just because he's white||87
If he was black he would say "thug" |Lakers|2
We tried.  We really did.  Love looked great at Minnesota.  |Cavaliers|31
I think he'll still be great for someone else. A change of scenery and a chance to find a rhythm would be good for him. |Pacers|3
Plus no one anticipated this Warriors team becoming this good, and the whole small ball thing that's taken the league by storm is a death knell for slower bigs. |Hawks|20
Kevin is a slow big? He's kinda slow I guess. Definitely not lumbering though.\n\nHe's better with a team built specifically around him, or he just needs more time adjusting to being a role-player. I mean imagine if K Love asked to be the primary option on offense and asked LeBron to just play really elite defense and stretch at the 4 and 5 and asked Kyrie to only use his ball-handling and penetration to set up Kevin for 3's, post-ups close to the rim, and pick and pops? \n\nBecause in Minny that's how he played ball. Pek made up for his defense. Rubio couldn't shoot so he just set up KLove all game. Nobody else could do shit so they just ran the floor for outlet passes and defended. |Lakers|3
He gets up and down the court well, but he just simply isn't athletic enough to be a positive matchup against mobile bigs. SF playing big, and athletic bigs, particularly dribble penetration guys, like Draymond, boogie, and Blake just neutralize his impact. |Celtics|5
He was solid for almost the entire Eastern conference run, he just matches up terribly against GS and it seems to have gotten in his head. |Cavaliers|43
I can at least respect Kevin love for not taking 14 shots||771
A lot of the shots he took were wide open.. The fact that he missed doesn't make them bad shots. In fact if he passed on a lot of them, it would have been a bad basketball play.||1
Headline: Bron and Kyrie make 41 each, Love makes 42.\n\nSubtext: Love makes 4fouls, 2 points.||1
i'm pretty sure every one of Barnes 14 shots were completely wide open ||2
In the 4th quarter, Barnes missed what felt like five open 3's and like three contested shots at the rim.|[GSW] Draymond Green|2
The Warriors wanted and needed HB to take those shots though. He was open for a lot of them.|Vancouver Grizzlies|2
The 14 shots were not bad shots at all, he just missed them. He had 4+ open shots that he bricked.|Heat|16
He took 6 3's which were pretty much wide open and I agree he should always take them. But his 2's were contested and he's not very good at finishing at the rim.||2
He did a good job of "staying out of the way" tonight. Only set picks, help post, and made a few decent defensive plays. He\'s playing like someone who knows he\'s been playing terribly and has decided to help out in any way he can, which is pretty much the most you can hope someone in his position would do.|Nuggets|986
Yea he knows he's shit, but he's still out there hustling.||-3
> He did a good job of "staying out of the way" tonight.\n\nYeah, a great job.  3 rebounds in 33 minutes.|Cavaliers|0
Ya but, anyone would be better in that spot.  He's so bad at rebounding I'd rather have delavadova under the rim.  That was without bogut too.||1
True art.|Trail Blazers|1
Stay out of the way? I mean yeah but WTF, this guy is the "third best player" on a championship team and he scores 2 points in 33 minutes!!!!???\nAnd you don\'t have to stay out of the way on the boards, that is not encouraged. \nThere were probably a few fans who had 3 rebounds last night.||1
Bosh had 0 points in game 7 of the 2013 Finals.|76ers|1
At least Bosh played defense and I'll bet he had more than 3 boards||1
He didnt fight enough for rebounds on at least a few plays, giving the Warriors second chances off their misses.  Even if he's not shooting, he's gotta get more rebounds|Knicks|1
I don't get the hate for him after last night. His two teammates scored 82. That's nearly a whole team of offense. Even if he wanted too he couldn't have scored a lot, those two guys were hot and so were being fed. He missed a few good looks, but I think expecting more than 8-10 out of him at the most is just failing to consider how few possessions are in a game.||2
Love showed a lot of aggression on defense. Especially when his opponent would set a screen for Curry, and Love would press hard on the other side forcing Curry to turn back. |[CHI] Michael Jordan|2
I didn't get to see the game (damn antenna issues) but 32 minutes, 2 points, 3 rebounds, 1 assist...and second highest +-?? I'm impressed and very confused ||2
He played solid defense and did a great job contesting shots without fouling which is all they needed when LBJ and Kyrie were going off.|Supersonics|2
It's amazing how horrible he looks out there though.  That play where he cut baseline, caught a pass, had no where to go and just threw it away was mind boggling. ||2
he was +18|Pacers|3
Aka me in any pickup game||3
It's interesting.\n\nThe Cavs basically have no offense other than Kyrie, Lebron and Love Iso's and PnRs. \n\nIt's not a bad idea. Give the ball to your best players and let them work.\n\nSo in a game where Kyrie and Lebron are ballin like they are, Love actually did exactly what was needed. He didn't play a great game. Gave up a couple rebounds and didn't capitalize with the ball in his hands. But he probably affected the game more than people are giving credit for and did his job tonight. Make smart passes, set good screens, and rebound.\n\nHe did have the 2nd highest +/- tonight|Kings|3
Exactly, he's also recovering from a concussion, so i think that's the capacity he can play in right now|Cavaliers|3
Yea, you have to consider he just had a concussion. My gf had a concussion the same day Klove did playing pickup and she's still woozy and nauseous. I can imagine Klove has a pounding headache and feels like puking running and jumping. He really shouldn't be playing any contact sports for a few weeks.  \n\nNot sure why the commentators were trashing him during the game. Brain injuries are no fucking joke.|Lakers|103
[deleted]||-1
there's really nothing you can do though.  and being a professional athelete isn't going to help you heal faster from a brain injury|Cavaliers|2
weird tell lamar odom that. Any other person would've died from what Lamar went through, and he's alive and kicking.. I think you're not giving professional athletes and the resources that come along with it enough credit. You're telling me your gf and kevin love suffering from same concussion would heal at same speed? doubt it|Lakers|-1
It depends I had a bad fucking concussion where I had pins and needles through my body for the next few days, sporadic memory, difficulty walking etc. I played soccer that Friday 5 days later and I was about as bad as normal.|Wizards|-3
It's still dangerous as fuck. Imagine if you got another concussion on that Friday. Imagine if Klove got another concussion playing in game 4 or 5. How bad would that look for the league. Getting so many concussions so close together is extremely dangerous.|Lakers|3
I'm not saying it's not dangerous. I'm just saying it's entirely possible to be functioning at a normal level in a few days. |Wizards|2
people recover from concussions differently.\n\nhe wouldnt have passed through concussion protocol if he was still symptomatic.|Trail Blazers|-7
Lol it's cute that you think that. ||22
reddit is so weird.|Trail Blazers|2
People definitely recover from concussions differently... I completely lost my short term memory for 4 hours after a concussion and felt fine three days later. Some people get hit in the head and take months to recover. \n\nThe brain is complex, injuries to it are likewise complex, and we really have no idea how he feels.|Clippers|3
There are different levels of concussions too. Mild concussions are often not even known. The person hits their head but doesn't feel any real side effects and other than a headache might never even know they had one.\n\nI don't know how severe Love's was or your GF's, but you can't just compare them because they both were concussed.||2
It's admirable as shit if you ask me. Putting your ego aside for the good of the team is hard as shit. |Cavaliers|649
But not exactly something you want from a max-contract player.|Suns|1
He did just have a concussion, I think people treat concussions way too lightly... They do effect you for quite some time... |Cavaliers|10
What's your definition on shit here? Feel like we need to make that clear. ||1
Something thats hard to let your body do.|Cavaliers|1
That's why I'm so good at orgys.|Raptors Bandwagon|1
Or you could just play better? |Spurs|1
He played like me in 2K myCareer when I\'ve already got a C- and I\'m trying not to get into "terrible game that gets me cursed out by the coach" territory.|Warriors|2
admirable?Admirable? Would be for a role player. \n\nGuy is getting paid all-star money to put up numbers. This is inexcusable in my opinion. I'm actually in disbelief , in how many people are trying to find a silver lining or excuse for this guy.\n\nHe's been a huge no show for awhile now.||3
Imagine if you are one of the best in the world at what you do, but you're going against the only people in the world that negate your biggest strengths and highlight your biggest weaknesses. On top of that you get a concussion after you played a very solid game 1. It'd still be hard to take a back seat and not bitch. He's manned up though and accepted his job and does his best that he can. |Cavaliers|14
Would probably buy the concussion excuse if he was any decent before it. The problem is he's been shit for them and inconsistent for the past 2 years. It's a joke now really.\n\nGetting the magnifying glass put on you and failing to contribute at ALL, is what makes you soft. He's a soft player. He does not get a pass.\n\n\n\nKevin Love was put on this team to contribute in a big way as he gets paid in a big way. 2 points is fucking laughable. ||-9
i mean, can anyone disagree that kevin love has been a big disappointment? i don't necessarily agree with your tone but it's no question that klove has not performed up to both his standard and the standard of other players who could've gotten that money.|Clippers|4

100%. All finals tbh. He's taken a back seat and not distracted at all. People keep ripping on his defense but he's been solid for the most part. It's his offense that's so reprehensible and he's stayed involved. Much respect.|Cavaliers|6
Yeah I actually thought his defense was pretty good this game |Hawks|1
He got smoked by curry a couple times, but he's made plays on defense all series. Re watched a couple games and I feel good about his defense for the most part. His offense has just been horrid.|Cavaliers|3
Did you see Frye? ||6
Especially when Lebron rips your chest open and eats your heart when you go for a high five.||470
That's the first time I looked at Lebron's arm and didn't think he huge. It's all about the angles ||1

I mean, if you don't have any context...|Celtics|6

ah, gotcha||4
I'm almost certain he was talking about a rebound and not going for a high five there. |Cavaliers|165

His ear was hardly touched on the play- give that guy an oscar.. pathetic. They need to start giving out reverse fouls for guys like that who try and fake it and delay the game.||9

I dont think he should be playing so soon after the concussion. Jefferson played way better tonight I think ||1
But seriously, what are they going to do about him? They can't continue to win the series if he keeps playing like this.|Cavaliers Bandwagon|3

Forreal though, concussion symptoms can last weeks. When I had one I was dizzy and nauseous for at least 2 weeks. My gf had one the same day as Klove and right now she's nauseous as fuck and has pounding headaches everytime she stands up. |Lakers|3
He's been playing with concussion symptoms for 2 years!even before he got hit! ||-1
wtf? |Lakers|2
sarcasm. He's been playing like utter shit for 2 years.\n\n\nThe concussion isn't the reason he's off.||1
Idk. Love's averaged a double-double per game for the whole season and he became a double-double machine again during the playoffs. He played well in game 1 vs warriors and got injured in game 2. Yes, he's a defensive liability but he's improved his D for the playoffs. Yes, he only scored 2 points this game but his off-ball team play has been pretty good. Not sure why people hate on him so much. Kyrie does less than Love for the whole season and all of a sudden after he has 1 good game, he's a clutch god?? |Lakers|1
Ya thats true I really already forgot about the concussion. I don't understand how a doctor can clear a basketball player after like a week, he even if he passes a protocol test, thats just dangerous|Knicks|5
That's not even sad thats just fucking hilarious. |Cavaliers|14

The stats don't show it, but Love obviously had some kind of positive impact for the Cavs tonight.||66
You're a nice guy|Thunder|1
He only took 5 shots...its not like he went 1-20||14
Offensively sure. But defensively he's becoming a huge liability, especially when they try to get the switch with curry or thompson|Thunder|-4
Honestly I think he did a *fuck* of a job tonight on the Pick and Rolls out on the perimeter. Curry hit one right in his face, but even then, his defense was good af.||10
Agreed, he looked fine on d. The few times he got iso'd on the 3 pt line with curry he played about as well as possible||6
Sure. You guys have your opinions and viewpoints and I respect that. To me I saw a liability on the pick and rolls. Saw a couple of lazy contests and all around low energy on the perimeter. Post defense was great though! |Thunder|-3
He did: A savvy 2 pts, a hard fought 2 boards, 1 dazzling assist, and only 2 turnovers. He also chipped in with 0 steals.||22
A misses rebound taken by curry|West|4
EXCUSE ME... three boards.|Timberwolves|14
+18 but idk how much that says really.|Spurs|10
its kinda laughable how bad Love has been this series, I mean wtf|Supersonics|425
Dude he is concussed. You don't just magically heal from that in two days. ||1
He's so timid, a perennial double double guy and now he has more fouls than points\n||1
that +18 tho?|Clippers|1
2 points? Like what the fuck? That's on another level than just playing bad |Knicks|1
Laughable isn't even the word. \n\nHe's been straight up garbage.\n\nYou don't have to make shots, but you can defend, pass, set screens, rebound, or just... look like you give a fuck.|Cavaliers|2
I would without doubt start and play Richard Jefferson in Love's place. He's playing with energy, defends and actually can finish while being strong and aggressive with the ball. ||1
No touches... is doing most of the other things... you're reactionary... ||3
at least his defense wasnt as horrible. almost decent. almost.|Cavaliers Bandwagon|2
he was alright in game 1 17 points 13 rebounds or something |[LAL] Kareem Abdul-Jabbar|2
Kevin Love has fallen off the face of the earth|Raptors|2
He's not playing well, yea. But the Cavs aren't doing him any favors either. Their spacing is awful anytime they do give him touches because TT is always hanging around the basket for those offensive boards, allowing his man to help on Love.|Knicks|3
He was actually +18 tonight, second only to Kyrie's +20. That's actually pretty damn good considering everyone considers him to be a defensive liability and he only posted 2 points and 3 rebounds.\n\nEdit: Yes, we all know you think that +/- is a useless stat. Go upvote one of the several people who already said that instead of posting it again.|[OKC] Russell Westbrook|93
But look at everybody else on CLE's starting lineup. They're all around that number. Just because he was on the floor while they were scoring and had the lead doesn't really mean he was a contributing factor in that. \n|Spurs|0
+/- means jack shit|Kings|0
This just shows you how useless of a stat plus/minus is.|Pacers|0
lol situations like these are why +/- are such a bad metric...||24
I honestly have no clue how an offensive player who doesn't show up offensively posts a number like that. It was on 32 minutes, so it's not like he just happened to be out there for a run or it's a super small sample size or anything.|[OKC] Russell Westbrook|-3
It just means his teammates played really well.|Cavaliers|13
Which, I totally get. But he had the second best +/- in the entire game. \n\nKyrie: +20\n\nLove: +18\n\nLeBron: +13\n\nTT/JR: +11\n\nRJ: +7\n\nShump: +6\n\nDellavedova/Mo/DJ/JJ/Mozgov: all negative\n\nYou expect Kyrie and LeBron to have high +/- in a game where they both drop 41 (and also to have caught the other team's best attempts at a comeback), and some bleedover to JR and TT because they share offensive minutes. But Love has triple Shump's on an extra 7 minutes of playing time, and a higher value than JR, who has been playing good defense this year.|[OKC] Russell Westbrook|11
When it doesn't agree with your narrative, it's a terrible metric.|[DET] Jerry Stackhouse|22
It's great when Draymond Green has a shit game though.||4
In that case, it is the one true metric.|[DET] Jerry Stackhouse|1
Or it shows how important Kevin's spacing and passing is to Cleveland? There's a reason Lue is still playing him|Cavaliers|22
He set screens and got it to the hot hand.  Definitely made some plays on defense as well.|Timberwolves|17
He played hard today. Only reason he really didn't get any looks were because of the way Kyrie and LeBron were flowing |Heat|8
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yXiWZyJL90|Spurs|1
Good grief. 82 points by LBJ/Kyrie.\n\nLove 2 points.\n\nWhat you can take away from this series and this game: Love and Barnes are not maximum contracts guys.\n\nLeBron/Kyrie - Curry/Klay most certainly are.|[ATL] Pete Maravich|296
What's Draymond worth in your estimation?||1
If you take love off that team and put him on a team where he is the number one guy again that probably changes idk tho|[POR] Tim Frazier|1
**84 points from LBJ/Kyrie/Love**|Bulls|1
There have been games where you can argue Barnes has been the best warrior. ||6
There have definitely been games in these playoffs where he has been valuable, but would you rather have a consistently good player or an inconsistently good-very good player?|Lakers|5
That would be a very poor argument.|Cavaliers|43
he didn't say this series, or that anyone would win the argument|Timberwolves|6
This puts kobe's 81 point game in perspective, pure dominance |Timberwolves|3
that was the greatest individual performance in the modern era in NBA history .. but imagine if Kobe did it in a Finals game. that'd be ... legendary. I already think his last game will go down as one of if not the best ever for a retiring player, especially at his age. do you see any other 35/36/37 year olds throwing up 60 in their last NBA game? I don't think it'll ever be beaten ...|Lakers|3
Obviously, I knew Kobe had it in him to go for 40 atleast once this season, but 60?!?!? If you told me that even a day before he did it I would of laughed|Timberwolves|1
If you had told me with 5 minutes left in that game that Kobe would finish with 60 I would have laughed. |[UTA] Pete Maravich|1
truth|Supersonics|2
That's fucking retarded, we've seen Kevin Love average 25/13 in a season on a .500 team. ||3
Also, Green is too a maximum contract guy if you don't mind the extra fees for unprovoked kicks in the nads.|Cavaliers Bandwagon|4
Love is still a contract player. This Cavs team just doesn't make sense with him. Now put him on the clerics or rockets...||16
I think he'd more of a tank or damage dealer than a cleric. ||9
Is he going to be praying on the Clerics? |Celtics|39
*Someone* had to cast a res on LeBron.|Lakers|1
Yes, but his stat line still won't reflect his effort|Trail Blazers|1
gotta give Lebron and Kyrie those buffs man.|Cavaliers|1
He doesn't worship the basketball gods he is the basketball god. From Columbus to Cleveland, when home fans see Love in the starting lineup they pray.||2
Except Love put up an efficient 26/12/4 just two years ago. He looks like a shell of that player now, but he earned his max contract. |Timberwolves|10
Everything about Love suggested he was though. Can't really fault Cleveland giving a max to a guy who averaged 26/12 one year. Barnes has proved nothing and will be a massive disappointment though|[NJN] Vince Carter|15
Big three combined for 84 points, pretty good. |Knicks|401
What did Kobe and Smush combine for was it?||4
83 I think|[LAL] Smush Parker|4
Love only scored 2 more points than me that game... nerd to negotiate my contract mane||23
this guys looks at the glass half full :)||7
He doesn't really match up well against anyone on the warriors and they're so good at switching screens he doesn't get open 3 pointers. |Cavaliers|51
I don't know what people expect him to do honestly. He didn't play *bad* last night. Lebron and Kyrie were jacking up shots all game and they have him standing on the wing so he never gets offensive boards. \n\nAt least the effort is there on defense. He's not great on D but I see him working getting out on shooters which is more than I can say for JR Smith. One of the best moves Ty Lue made last night was playing Shumpert and Jefferson more with Lebron and Kyrie for large stretches.||1
He's getting no touches, he's like a homeless man's Bosh right now|Suns|434
He can't hold a candle to Heat-era Bosh. Dude was a defensive masterpiece and he could shoot from anywhere. I'm a huge fan of Bosh.|Grizzlies|1
Bosh is a damn good player but he's not an elite defender.  He was perfect for Miamis small lineups though with his footwork and his ability to move people twice his weight around down low.  He could also switch everything like TT can.  Now that I think about it, your right,  he was a master in Miami's system elite or not.|Cavaliers|2
In that high pace trapping defense, Bosh ended up being one of the better defenders in the league. He realllly adapted well to it. The guy is super smart and doesn\'t slouch on defense. And on O? He got open like a spot up shooter while constantly dominating 6\'8" forwards in the high post because he\'s as big as a center with the footwork and speed of an average PF. I won\'t pretend Bosh would be as good anywhere else, but he was nearly perfect in that system and alongside Wade and Lebron.|Grizzlies|1
*Syrian refugee's Bosh|[MIA] Alonzo Mourning|1
Exactly. Even when Bosh scored 2 points he at least killed it on defence. |Raptors|1
Man Bosh disappeared all the time in the finals. This revisionist history is ridiculous.|Cavaliers|1
Never to this point though, Love hasn't had a single great game and has been awful on both ends|Suns|1
steph curry wins rebounds over him, that's not even close to homeless.||1
I feel like a lot of stretch 4s get shafted now with touches, at least on a team with another superstar. Ibaka gets the same treatment from time to time in OKC. |[OKC] Russell Westbrook|1
Definitely, Ibaka was the next comparison I had in mind after Bosh |Suns|1
Well, it's tough to play him when he's getting killed on the defensive end. ||1
>homeless man\n\nlmao|Warriors|1
That doesn't excuse his horrific defense.|Wizards|1
He doesn't need an excuse, he's never been able to play defense. At least when he was with us he was grabbing boards like a monster, he's a shell of himself on this team. |Timberwolves|1

There's a reason he's not getting touches. He's not very good when he gets them. I feel like he's very weak the ball. I'm not sure what happened when he came to the Cavs but this isn't the same person that played for Minnesota ||8
yeah they get him the ball with freakin barnes or even curry on him and he cant seem to muscle them at all.\n\nits just a wasted 8 seconds until he has to pass out.|Knicks|0
That's kind of an insult for bosh though|Raptors|62
LeBron had zero assists in the first half because he'd keep dishing to Love. And Love would promptly brick it. |Supersonics|3
Love only had 5 shots in the game, so that's probably an inaccurate statement.||1
I never watched Minny but Kevin Love stats always stuck with me. He had that insane double double streak. Stats like 30/20 20/20 weren't unusual for him. Of course there are a lot of debates about inflated stats on bad team, fat Kevin Love, fitting in Cleveland but I'd never guessed we'd see performances like that from him while still at peak.\n\nNot saying a bad player, he will find his spot.|Raptors|4
He was the main option on O there, and presumably he didn't play much D. I didn't watch the TWolves. |Supersonics|1
Kevin Love has never and will never play much D|Timberwolves|3
He looks lost when he does get them. Dude has hands like butter |[WAS] John Wall|116
Looks even more lost on defense. |Spurs|-1
So many out of bounds possessions were lost because he either couldn't catch the ball or touched it.\n\nCavs without Kevin love in 2016 finals 100%\nCavs with Kevin love in 2016 finals 25%|Spurs|1
he just looks like the moment is too big for him|East|3
This.... He's a great player on a bad or mediocre team in the regular season. This league is different in the playoffs and then of course the finals. I feel for him|Cavaliers|3
He's just so surprised they passed him the ball||3

If you watch it again he's not even going for a high five. He's gesturing about the defense on the play before |Nuggets|11
I guess. I don't know what Lebron is doing, though. Is he boxing out? Tightening his belt? Trying to put two strong magnets together the wrong way? |Knicks|47

he played like ass tonight|Timberwolves|-1
He wasn't actually going for a high five. He had just got beat on a defensive play and walked up to LBJ re-enacting what he did on defense by putting his hand in the air. Then LBJ retorts telling him he should have done something else. Something along those lines but it def wasn't a missed high five and he was simply defeated in that moment from giving up a bucket via miscommunication. Still looks funny AF though. |Spurs|-2
I think he was re enacting his defense on the previous play and he wasn't going for a high 5||5
LeBron and Kyrie sapped his life forces. You can see it in the gif.|Lakers|13
LeBron = Gul'Dan?  You can't do that in Mok'Gora!!!||1
Where's the honor?! You've lost the clans' respect!||1
Copying and pasting myself from the game thread... \n\nI vividly remember seeing this. It followed a play where Kevin went for a block, blocked it, and then whoever his helper was didn\'t get the rebound, leading to a easy layup for GSW. \n\n\nKevin was pleading his case to Lebron. I remember thinking to myself "Kevin has a point"\n\nThe gif begins late. You can see Kevin mouthing "I blocked the shot" but this gif begins after that had happened. \n\nOut of context, yes, it\'s comical. ||162
K-Love: "I blocked the shot!  *You* were supposed to box him out!"\n\nL-Bron: "I\'ve got three kids, I\'m a man"||3
The fact that Love has to defend himself after that shows how hard it has to be playing with Lebron. Doesn't look fun at all. ||7
the NBA Mini-Movie for game 4 shows Curry saying "we gotta have eachothers backs, Together on 3, 1,2,3 TOGETHER" Lebrons pre game huddle before they ran out the tunnel you hear Lebron say "Follow my lead" Just goes to show you the type of teams they play for. |Raptors|1
Said this better than I did. I was waiting for someone to point out that he wasn't actually having a high five rejected. But yeah, it sure does look funny. |Spurs|61

Don't feel sorry for him, he's robbing Cleveland tonight, by putting up 2 points. ||2

Why would you feel bad? He is making a max contract, $110 million, and he can't shoot and can't even rebound over Steph Curry.|NBA|-4
the man still got feelings\n\nion think its that deep tho he just looks so sad in the vid|[CLE] Iman Shumpert|33
I hope Lebron apologizes. |Cavaliers|3
Kinda hope the Cavs win the title so Love can happily go play as big dog for a mediocre team.|Nets|3

I've always wondered what happens if I eat a meal somewhere, and after its consumed, they tell me it is cash only. If there are no signs or forewarnings, am I obligated to find a way to pay? I know the answer is yes, but I think that's silly. |Hawks|1
If they said it was cash only and I had no cash, I would just ask to run to the ATM down the road. Im sure most places wouldnt mind, especially if you left another credit card with them as collateral. Yes I think about it a lot hahah|Cavaliers|1
Happened to me couple days ago, had to talk to manager who was able to run my card through their catering business and acted like he was doing me some huge favor like wtf.||2

Contrary to what everyone wants to believe, I'm pretty sure he was demonstrating his attempt at defense, not looking for a high five. |Cavaliers|5
I think those were still effects from his concussion realizing he didn't deserve a high five from the king |Timberwolves|29

Waz poppin!|NBA|2
I said it from the jump but Cavs would have been much better off with Wiggins on a rookie deal and using the money they gave Love to fill out their roster with better role players... but ayyy thanks for my boy Wiggy doe\n\nedit: wiggins averaged 25 ppg vs the Warriors this season.. perfect guy to match their length and is a way better defender than people think he is.. he could easily start next to James at SG and then you bring JR Smith off the bench.. way better for the Cavs than having to deal with Love who is non existent |Timberwolves|443
I don't reckon we had the cap space, but I don't really remember at this point. |Cavaliers|3
Dude, Cavs are so far over the cap. Call means nothing. ||1
He's talking about back in 2014. |Cavaliers|1
Wiggins isn't a good shooter or defender... plus the offense that he does provide might not have been as good, it seems like when he has the opportunity he sort of floats along|Knicks|7
That Wiggins is not a good defender I am hearing for the first time. Also offense would have not been needed on the Cavs with Lebron and Kyrie around. He would have had a "Barnes"-like role I\'d imagine.||-1
I don't have the stats, but I watch a good amount of wolves games, and he was supposed to be this amazing defender, but at best he's JR level, in that he has the physical gifts to be really great, but between dumb mistakes and being a step behind on some plays, he just isn't |Knicks|0
He was learning on a bad team. It's an assumption, but you would think he would develop differently on a winning team||8
Right, develop differently as in develop worse. Championship contenders can rarely afford to have a rookie play crucial minutes, they just make dumb mistakes from lack of experience.|Knicks|6
Kawhi says hi ||6
Kawhi made a lot of dumb mistakes his first two years and he didn't get quality minutes for awhile. He's arguably a top 3 player in the league though so even when he was making rookie mistakes he was still playing at a high level.||1
True but next year would be Wiggins' 3rd year and he'd get tons of minutes next to LeBron. Unless you think Dion Waiters was going to keep Wiggins on the bench lol. Agreed there would be learning pains but LeBron is only 31. Having Wiggins for the next 5-7 years would be great||1
Obviously everything changes individual to individual, and the spurs have amazing player development, but if I were the Cavs I'd still rather have 2015-16 love on the team than 2015-16 Wiggins|Knicks|5
They just won 2 finals game where Love either didn't play or scored 2 points. You're out of your mind if you wouldn't rather have the most athletic young wing chasing around Klay instead of JR Smith and Shumpert||-1
Who needs three point shooting|Bulls|8
nah. I don't know if the trades would have still gone through but he would be redundant with Smith and Shump. I agree that the Love trade, in the context of the Warriors, is poor, though.|Cavaliers|7
Was there anyone else out there Wiggins could've been traded for that would've fit better than Love?|Celtics|1
As I recall, not anybody who was on the trade block and better than Wiggins.  Love is an all-star caliber player who was also clearly on his way out of Minnesota anyway, so they were willing to deal.  While I preferred to keep Wiggins, I don't think the Love deal was bad, but I think any other realistic trade was going to be a step down, so the Cavs would have kept Wiggins and developed him.|Cavaliers|2
Wiggins gets most of his points from isolations and the Cavs already have Kyrie and Lebron. The warriros would just dare Wiggins to shoot and sag off and help on Kyrie and Lebron. Jr smith is much better suited to play with them |Rockets|13
I said it when we drafted Wiggins... I always thought Lebron would be back after the Miami contract, and when we got him the media immediately started hyping Wiggins for Love. Love is a fantastic offensive PF, but he isn't strong/big enough to play against the dominant (Drummond/Howard) centers and he's not a good enough defender, especially on P&R to be a 3 and D PF which is what Lebron really wants.\n\nLove is a PF you build around as the core of the offense. He can get you 40/10-15 and a couple assists but he needs a lot of time with the ball to do that. Wiggins was already a good defender, extraordinarily athletic, and could easily have started that the 2 with Lebron at the 3 (though Wiggins 3 Lebron 4 would be my preference).\n\nWhen we traded for Love we gave up a future all-star to load our offense with more options than we can use while sacrificing defense and all of our cap room. Lebron's a great passer, he could use Wiggins slashing w/ defense, and Wiggins will likely develop a decent jump shot to compliment the two.\n\nT'Wolves are going to be stacked in a couple years.|Cavaliers|6
I mean in the NBA you ALWAYS take success now over success later. The Rockets basically mortgaged the franchise to win a ring while MJ was playing baseball and it was a great move. \n\nWiggins was a question mark at the time. He was super athletic, but had no jumper and his defense was an unknown. A Kyrie, JR, Wiggins, Lebron lineup would probably be terrible. I don't know how you can say the Love big 3 lineup is too many options and then think a lineup with Wiggins would be better. His game is Kyries and Lebrons game, but worse. They'd have 3 p[layers that want the same shots. He's not a good enough defender to put on Klay or Curry and he's too small to play Iggy or Green.\n\nIf the Cavs never win a ring with this lineup yeah it will have been a mistake, because the franchise will have no cap and no young stars. But, I don't think they win with Wiggins in the lineup and Wiggins is going to need a max so after his rookie deal the team gets blown up anyway.\n\n||1
you guys are gonna be so fuckin stacked I'm already afraid. |Cavaliers|90
Did you forget they play in the West?\n\nThere is nothing to even be remotely afraid about the Timberwolves |Bulls|-9
Didn't we sweep you guys?|Timberwolves|1
I think you are massively underestimating them. If the whole team lives up to it's potential they'll be scary-good. |Cavaliers|9
Out of everything they have I'm actually most excited to see Dieng play under Thibs.\n\nNoah was always a good defender, mostly because he works his ass off, but it wasn't until Thibs got there that he became a serious DPOY candidate. I think Dieng has a bit more athleticism. |Bulls|5
You are probably right. Dieng has some talent, but makes a lot of questionable decisions as a defensive backstop, mostly he is too eager for blocks and will let players blow by him to try and goad them into a shot. It rarely works though, they do shoot it, but he does not block it.\n\nThibs might break him of that habit.|Timberwolves|1

Lebron is like, enjoy this shit now GSW, you're gonna have to go thru a Thibs team with atheletes next year, RIP endurance.|Bulls|8

Wiggins is super redundant on this Cavs team, and he can\'t shoot 3s. His best skillset at the moment is transition offense and mid range jump shooting, and the Cavs already have two players who are super good at those things(Bron and Kyrie, respectively). And even the assumption that "Love was trash" in this game is overstated, he was +18, played super hard on defense, spaced and played smartly on offense. Even if he\'s missing jumpers, you have to respect his shooting and passing if youre the Warriors, just being on the court is a positive influence for the Cavs O.|Kings|28
He shot 41.3% from 3 after the ASG|Timberwolves|3
To be fair they lost 16/28 games and only 2-3 of those wins were against competitive teams with something to play for. Most players shoot better second half of season, particularly on teams that aren't going anywhere because good teams get complacent and rest good players.||0
To play devil's advocate, Wiggins is a great/good defender unlike Love and to be fair he he doesn't fit any worse into the Cavs offense than Love does while carrying less ego (no-one would be talking about him struggling even if he did).||4
Wiggins is not as good a defender as you think he is, bro|Hawks|1
He's definitely not top tier, but he's a good solid defender with potential to grow. He's definitely head and shoulders above Love||2
he has the tools to be a great defender, he is not yet\n\nAnd Love is a very good three point shooter, elite passer, and a real post up threat, and Wiggins doesn't really do any of those things and would cramp their spacing, so I don't see how he fits into their offense.|Kings|5
Love is a good shooter and outlet passer, but on the Cavs he has shown a real lack of comfort down in the low post, probably due to spacing issues because of how often these low post possessions are just forced. This is why I don't think he fits in their offense, as a former star he gets random plays called for him just because he needs shots, even if the plays are pretty bad or ruin the flow of their offense.||1
I love how everyone with an opinion is smarter than an NBA GM. If cavs were up 3-1 in this series, no one would say a word about Love sucking (IRL love does suck btw, but this ain't /r/heartbreak)\n|Heat|0
I agree with you, but how does Wiggins make anything better. He's not someone you'd trust to guard a Klay or a Curry for 7 games and Love is already serviceable enough to guard a Barnes. I guess maybe Wiggins could have done better on Livingston, but that forces Kyrie onto Klay or Curry.\n\nIf there had been another free agent out there who was available when they signed Love who was a genuine defensive stopper at the 4 I could see the argument of keeping Wiggins on his rookie deal and using the money to sign that guy and maybe another 3 and D guy, but there really was nobody available.||1
I would definitely had gone with the trade, at the time no one yet knew if Wiggins would develop as fast as he has, and everyone expected Love to fit into the offense (that I was a bit on edge about but I didn't think it would be as bad as last season). However, in hindsight it's suddenly a lot more close, simply because of how Love has struggled.||1

We Need to Talk About Kevin |[BOS] Kevin Garnett|257
[Hi, Kevin](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CTBKNoFUEAAgXuX.jpg)|Cavaliers|1
That Kevin could shoot.|NBA|7
Can someone tell me what in the world Kevin Love brings to the table in these finals and why he's out there at all with the numbers he's putting up? Serious question. I'm not a bball genius, but from what I see he's not defending well and do we even need to talk about his offense? |Spurs|59
In the finals? Not much. He doesn't match up that well against the Warriors, but I think it's crazy how down people are on him for this series alone. He put up good numbers in the playoffs alongside two dominant ball handlers. People just really like hating celebrities/athletes. It's just kind of weird.|Cavaliers|2
It bothers me that Klove gets all these minutes while mozgov gets none vs. a team thats weak @ centre.|Celtics|2
It's weird, Love had 2 points tonight but went +18. Go figure!|NBA|22
Well he played a lot of minutes with LeBron and Kyrie||14
You could also say that LeBron and Kyrie are +13 and +20 respectively in part because they played a lot of minutes with Kevin.|Knicks|18
welcome to why +/- is a dumb stat for comparing individuals|Hornets|1
He never was nor will he ever be a good defender.  He's not quick enough or long enough or athletic enough to be a good defender.  \n\nHowever, offensively he's completely miscast in Cleveland.  They've pigeon holed him to corner three's and spot mopping duties offensively. His best space is the space in which Kyrie and LBJ both operate from (top of key - elbows). CLE doesn't have a defensive stopper at center, and the 4 is LBJ's best position on the court, both of which expose Loves inefficiencies.  There isn't anywhere to hide him on D against GSW either, which compounds the issue. \n\nKLove is still a great player. He's just not a top tier player, and is miscast in CLE I think his best fit is 1st off the bench type of player to play with the second unit to best maximize his offensive skills, and minimize his defensive liabilities.   |Celtics|89
"pidgeon holed him" - That\'s because he\'s soft (he spent years in MIN being a great regular season player).\n\nHe doesn\'t play well because physicality and speed bothers him a lot. He\'s too soft and too slow for a team running and gunning. \n\nPlayoff games are too chaotic and fast for Klove||-3
I think the 'soft' narrative is pretty disrespectful. He's just not a banger and not super physical, but I don't think he's mentally fragile or lacks willpower. |Cavaliers|3
Soft can be a physical assessment, not just a mental. You pretty much described what sounds like a soft player to me when describing Love. ||-2
I don't like the terminology because it's a passive aggressive way of insinuating that a player is a bitch ..as if somehow aggression and physicality outright trumps finesse and basketball IQ. I find that subtext absurd.|Cavaliers|6
Do you not consider Mosgov a good defender? |Bulls|1
I agree, I think he should go to his hometown trailblazers, or the Lakers, where he went to college (ucla) ||1
I think he'd be much better as a 6th man/star of the 2nd unit.  You're right that he's just odd man out when Kyrie and LeBron are both on the floor, and letting him be odd man out for all of his minutes is a waste of his talent.  There are a lot of guys who can give you decent corner 3's and no defense.  Love has more to offer than that, but doesn't get to show it.\n\nEDIT:\n\nUnless they specifically run plays for him.  When the Cavs make a concerted effort to get him going, Love does have good games.|Cavaliers|2
Good analysis and helpful insight for me.  Why does he have a max contract then?||2
His last 4 years in Minnesota he was a big man averaging almost 20 points a game.|Timberwolves|5
They didn't stick him in the corner either, so he could rebound and outlet which is probably his best skill.  LeBron painted himself in a corner by making the Cavs sign Tristan Thompson, who does some of what Love can do without the offense.|[MIN] Felton Spencer|1
Was he close to that in Cleveland regular season or playoffs?  Has he just disappeared in the Finals?||1
This year he averaged 16 points and 9.9 rebounds per game. \n\nIn the playoffs, he's at 15.4 points, 8.8 rebounds. \n\nIn the finals, he's at 8.8 points, 6 rebounds. ||3
Almost 20? Lol he had like 4 seasons where he had 25 ppg, LED the league in rebounds, all while looking like one of the best high-volume 3point shooters. Basically Demarcus Cousins if he was a soft white guy... \n\nThat's insane for a white dude who's one of the worst athletes we've seen in a while. You had to max him with the belief that his stats come from high BBIQ and skill, and that he'd be a capable 1.b on a contending team. So if you modestly projected Wiggins to be a Rudy Gay type player after 3 years, then you had to trade him for a prime K. Love. ||5
I was watching the second half last night and EVERY single time down the floor he just ran to the corner and stayed there.  Sometimes he rotated the other corner.  If that is all the coach tells you to do you aren't going to look like anything great.||6
The NBA has also changed a lot in the last couple years in regards to defense and match-ups (at least in the upper tier of teams) compared to when he was putting up monster numbers in Minnesota|Raptors|11

I keep hoping for that glare that we saw in G6 in Boston.  No glare, but pretty close tonight.  And Klay was playing Rondo's role of *ima take this bitch away from you or die trying, LeBron*.|Knicks|19

I\'m not gonna Find it / link it cuz I suck like that, but He had that "I\'m a lion" state in that game vs Boston. You could tell early on that he was feelin it|Heat|2
Villain lebron was so gnarly|Knicks|1
That was the best game I've ever seen him play, he just had that cold blank glare on his face the entire game. Had 45 and 15 from memory while sitting most of the 4thQ because it was a blowout, what a clutch performance.|Cavaliers Bandwagon|9
No question.  Don't forget the assists in these games too....even dropping 40 he's still pass first.  Rarely ignores the open teammate even when he's cooking.|Knicks|4

62 points is nothing to sneeze at though. Really shows how Dray's shooting and rebounding can help Golden State. His non-presence was felt in the second half when Golden State was bricking it up. |Magic|1
I think it was a Kevin love reference|Lakers|4
My bad. Love's best game was Game 1, and after the concussion, he hasn't been of much assistance. |Magic|1
That was by far my favorite game on Xbox. I didn't play it as much as CoD or anything, but I really enjoyed grinding those missions over and over to buy everything.|Timberwolves|3
Me and my cousin played the hell out of that demo on Ps3|Grizzlies|5
It's crazy how well they defended Kyrie, too. Lebron did a great job taking all the jump shots the Warriors gave him. ||7
Fuck I forgot about that. That game was so legit.|Spurs|12
I hated Devils Cartel though. I miss the aggro/sneaky guy combo team. Devils Cartel was just straight up Die Hard blowing shit up. I liked the teamwork in the second one. I miss co op games. Real co op games|[CLE] Matthew Dellavedova|1
I played the second one to death before my xbox blew. The lack of scenery changes made #2 less interesting to me, and the story line wasn't nearly as good. The first one was the only good one to me.\n\nAnd yes, I 100% agree with your stance on co-op games.|Spurs|1
fuck i miss that game|Cavaliers|17
What do you mean? The big three had 84 points combined |[CHI] Horace Grant|415
Yeah and Kobe combined with the white Mamba for 81 |Clippers|184

And kyrie is just hanging out with her for he personality right ? Why is one called a whore and the other a player ?|Hawks|9
The male equivalent of a whore isn't a guy that fucks a lot of women, it's a guy that stupidly squanders his status, wealth, and commitment. \n\nMen and women are not the same. Opposite sides of the game. \n\nA guy that fucks a lot is a stud. A girl that gets a ton of men to give her shit while getting nothing but some attention in return is the female equivalent. |Magic|-2

Comment of the year.|Cavaliers|4
Even Draymond Green was more productive than Kevin Love on the court today. |[POR] Allen Crabbe|820
Big if true.|Lakers|0
Love was +18, about the number of times Green would have gone for your balls, ankles or tried a WWE move tonight|Pacers|1
Rekt |Cavaliers|1
He's getting traded for sure |Clippers|1
Kevin Love did as little as he could to try and help Golden State win, but it was just too much. |Trail Blazers|1
Draymond wishes he could stand in a corner like Love can, he's the best at it. |Pistons|1
lmao ppl on twitter were absolutely shitting on him|Rockets|2
Mr. Butterfingers, holy crap he couldn't hold onto a rebound. ||2
Love was +23 despite having 2 points. Goes to show how moronic some fans are after only seeing the point category on the stat sheet.||9
Goes to show how moronic some fans are after only seeing the box score and not taking things into context.\n\n+/- is flawed , it's funny you would defend 2 contribution points from a guy getting paid big money. \n\neveryone's a data scientist on the internet now.||-1
If i'm pointing out a statistics that everyone is ignoring to continue their hate train against love, how does that make me a data scientist?||0
I'm using hyperbole,you're not a data scientist at all because you would've known the limits of  the stats you are using, thus you would refrain from typing that comment out with your ass. You're   calling someone else out for doing exactly the same  thing. \n\nTell me does the +/- stat take into account an all-star player putting up 2 points and 3 rebounds?It does not. You and those 9 people who up-voted you are idiots.\n\n||-1
Damn sherlock ever heard of sarcasm? The stat shows that despite everyone's hate train Love, he was still playing defense regardless of people might think. How do you expect the guy to score without touching the fucking ball you moron.||0
"He\'s still playing defense" , "How do you expect the guy to score without touching the fucking ball " - Nice. So he gets a participation certificate?\n\nThere\'s a reason why he\'s not touching the fucking ball - he fucking sucks and breaks the flow of the offense entirely.Cleveland was better off without him (and that\'s a HUGE RED FLAG) If you manage to pick up a fucking basketball and actually play the game(I did and do) you would know that. \n\n\n||0
or how worthless that stat is|Cavaliers|11
Outside of his effort on PnR defense he was useless. +23 is a product of him getting out of the way and letting kyrie and lebron work.|Heat|13
Yeah, but a lot of people can do that.  The one downside to the +/- stat is that in general...that's a team effort.  Someone like Love can disappear and still excel in this field because on the court is Lebron and Kyrie.  I think it's more telling if like everyone is + and then one guy is -  and you know he was a general downside when he was on the court.  That said, at least Love did his best to be productive in every other aspect of the game.|Supersonics|6

daaahknes|NBA|1
What happened in this clip exactly?|Spurs|1
What was the context for that? I didn't get to start watching until the second half.||1
I feel bad for Kevin :( he should come to a team without much scoring, maybe one that's about to lose it's primary rebounder and needs a double double machine. He would worsen our defense though...|Rockets|2
I don't really even like Love but damn :((|Rockets|2
Honestly makes me sad, he just wants to fit in :(\n|Cavaliers|5
Can someone explain to me what happened here lol|Charlotte Hornets|9
Looks like they were both trying to talk to someone else, lebron kinda looking towards the right, and Love looks like he was waving at someone behind lebron.|Raptors|-1
Love got called for a foul I think and was saying his hands were straight up. LeBron is telling him (I think about the last play where Love missed a  rebound) to use his body to gain position.|New Jersey Nets|8

Don't suck then||-3
right?Fuck you're getting paid millions of dollars, no ones feeling sorry for ya.||-5
Watching the games though, it's not entirely his fault he's doing terrible. Part of it is mental, but I think he doesn't get a chance to get into a rhythm at all. If he gets more touches I'm sure he'd be playing better.|Lakers|6
He's getting less touches because he's been playing poorly|Hornets|0
Doubtful. He doesn't get as much touches ever since he joined the Cavs.|Lakers|1
Not doubtful. I'm saying the past two games of this series he's been used a lot less because he's been doing poorly. Not talking about the overall season.|Hornets|1
Be glad they won or it woulda been a whole lot worse. ||4
He's just trying to drop some dimes|Cavaliers|68
I don't think people understand what happened. The video makes it look like Kevin was coming for a high five. I'm pretty sure he was just explaining something to LeBron. I just can't remember what it was. |Suns|238
This makes me feel better|Knicks|2
Not me||1
Exactly. He was showing LeBron how he was defending the play and LeBron showed him how he should've. Still a bit sad though. |Lakers|7
Looks like he might be doing the "I contested the shot I swear" while LeBron is like "you gotta stick that dude"|Warriors|10
Sometimes I hate when people explain the truth.||6
You are correct but that doesn't get upvotes |Cavaliers|50
I like the other version more. It makes me feel things|Cavaliers|2
Pretty sure it was after a foul and he's trying to say he only had his hand up. |[NJN] Vince Carter|119

what people have to realize is, for the majority at least, it isn't the same people flip flopping their opinions like this. it's just whoever is right at the time will obviously be louder. |Wizards|2
It's almost like there are people with different opinions here,  and they voice those thoughts at the appropriate time|Warriors|2
People on Reddit tell me it's just different people posting each time, I think it's just bipolar teenagers |Lakers|7

It's rarely fans of either team that participate |Nuggets|1
Yeah lol I love the people who think that a sub with nearly 400k subscribers all have the same opinions on stuff. Circlejerk threads are the way that they are because the title of the post draws likeminded people. They all upvote each other and anyone saying otherwise gets downvoted. it creates the illusion that everyone is agreeing with each other, but really it's just likeminded people agreeing. |NBA|3
Can we get this sticked to the top of /r/nba?  People need to see this so we can stop the constant complaining.  This is always how it's worked, and honestly this is the way I would expect it to be.|Cavaliers|1
They don't stay away entirely lol they still come in to downvote, just not comment.||2

is it the same people just saying different shit or do different people just visit and post depending on who wins? There has to be an explanation because the opinion changes so drastically depending on who wins.|Raptors|1
Who knows, but it's extra annoying in the playoffs especially when your team is in a deep playoff run. Learned that the hard way when I never visited this sub after games Raptors lost.|Raptors|1
nothing compared to bbs.hupu.com/vote||1
It's almost like we don't know whats going to happen so we have to react to it as it's happening....|East|1
People ignore everything based on the results of one game|Nuggets|1
it\'s a best of 7 series, the pendulum swings wildly, it\'s kinda hard not to be "reactionary"|East|1
The thing is, it really doesn't. One game doesn't immediately confirm everything for the series. The entire point of a series is not to be reactionary|Nuggets|1
Quite the overreaction to /r/NBA's overreaction wouldn't you say?|Heat|1
I have to agree. Most other subs usually just hate one way and they're pretty consistent\n\nThere's too much back and forth on here|Thunder|1
We need to get our hate set in a proper direction|Nuggets|1
It's election season everyone is in over reaction mode lmao.|[MIA] Voshon Lenard|1
It's because the winning team's fans flock to the sub after their team wins, while the losing team's fans want to avoid thinking about it.|Cavaliers|5
It's toxic af, it's the age demographic I'm pretty sure. \n\n/r/nfl isn't the same twitter meme culture this sub is|Suns|158
It's the stupid demographic, not the age demographic. You can be younger and not be an idiot. |Pistons|-3
The point of demographics is it is a generalization, and age is definitely related to stupidity.|Supersonics|4
Less than we'd like to think imo.|[CHI] Michael Jordan|1
It's exactly what the NBA is. Flashy, big personalities, on & off court drama, crazy wardrobes, the list goes on. It does entertainment as well or better than the NFL, so it's no wonder ESPN has turned into TMZ. Go big or go home||0
Jesus, it's different people dammit. The ones that overreact one way don't overlap much with the ones who overreact the other way. |Nuggets|0
But everybody has the same up voting privileges, and completely conflicting sentiments get upvoted to the top every single day|Suns|4
Because the people who lost ***stay away*** when they lose and the other side flocks to /r/nba when they win. |Nuggets|8
Some of these memes are so good though|[MIN] Karl-Anthony Towns|1
If nfl didn't ban things like that it would turn into a meme fest in about 30 minutes. That's how Reddit goes. Just look at the subreddits that decided to go modless for for a week. |Thunder Bandwagon|2
it's not the age demographic\n\n||3
I think that's just the culture of the NBA in general. Can't imagine the age difference is any different than r/NFL |Bulls|3
/r/nfl is definitely more serious and there are less memes, but that's part of what I like about this sub, everyone just has fun. |Knicks|22
Yeah but the tradeoff is everybody tries to be funny, which just means way less actually quality basketball discussion |Suns|43
Which is why we have the next day threads though so there's the best of both worlds. I understand what you mean about wanting more basket discussion than memes, but with the growing number of the sub and the amount of upvotes all the stuff gets oeille really enjoy it. |Raptors|1
True, I agree there needs to be a little more balance.|Knicks|1
And eventually it's just the same shitty memes over and over again.|Bulls|27
LeBron nodded|Rockets|11
That hot little slut|Heat|2
At some point people give up even trying to be funny though. \n\nLike is saying things like "LeBitch suck my dick" or "Draymond, eat a cock you donkey" even funny to anyone?\n\nJust kind of hateful.|Jazz|22
And it all still got upvoted. \n\nIf you're going to be hateful, at least be clever |Suns|10
/r/NBA went from "Lol fuck Draymond" to "Leave Draymond alone!!1!" in a span of couple of weeks. |Raptors|93

Not us OkC fans. Fuck Draymond Green.|Thunder|3
The hivemind that the NBA rigged the playoffs to extend the series by suspending draymond was fucking hilarious. |Suns|7
Span of one day. Pre suspension: "HOW CAN DRAYMOND KEEP GETTING AWAY WITH THESE DIRTY PLAYS"\n\nPost suspension "FUCK LEBRON HOW DARE HE SAY DRAYMOND SHOULD BE SUSPENDED"||7
More so than /r/NFL, and that's really saying something|Cavaliers Bandwagon|487
More game threads and more wins and losses for both teams will do that. But if NFL played up to seven games you wouldn't even be able to reach for your piece cause someone else is already circlejerking ya|Raptors|3
Gotta give credit where credit is due, one thing r/NFL does well is keep /new clean. Meanwhile we have pictures of road signs on the highway calling Lebron a bitch or TFW posts...|[MIA] Harold Miner|6
It helps that you only play one game per series.|Cavaliers|9
They only play 16 games a season yet somehow a single game for a player is taken as less meaningful to his overall talent than it is here in the NBA. In /r/NFL Brady can lose a game to the Eagles where he played badly late in the season and people can recognize "shit that\'s just a bad game for Brady, hopefully it doesn\'t effect the pats playoff seeding". Here Lebron loses a game to ONE OF THE BEST TEAMS EVER and it\'s "damn Lebron gets in the teams way, such a bitch"|Lakers|1
omg i couldn't imagine the salt i would produce playing the seahawks in a series in the playoffs\n\nedit: as a panthers fan|Charlotte Hornets|4
/r/NFL can be really boring but it's way more level headed or at least less reactionary than /r/NBA\n\nEdit: /r/baseball is GOAT subreddit though|Celtics|129
And /r/soccer is the best for memes, its all what goes in there.|Raptors|0
Wonder if it has to do with the pace of the games. From non-stop movement and action to slow as shit and boring.||0
/r/nfl has a lot dumber fans though. I think all the exclusively fantasy football people have created a huge segment of really stupid nfl fans.\n\nI'm a bigger NFL fan but I unsubbed from /r/nfl because that subreddit is all around terrible. At least when /r/nba is terrible it's funny.|Pacers|0
That's because anyone who can get a heart rate of over 100 without getting a heart attack doesn't watch baseball, real easy to not be reactionary if you can't type a comment about game 1 before the series finishes.||1
Actually it's just because the people over there are smarter. |Celtics|1
It was a Joke, but possibly because the demographic is different over at /r/baseball. I'm usually at /r/soccer, and that is very similar to this sub.||1
I don't know about that, DeflateGate was really fucking annoying over there.|Celtics|1
It was opportunity for everyone to circlejerk about how much they hated the Pats|[SAS] Tim Duncan|1

I actually think not making any of the All-NBA teams (such a travesty) significantly contributed to improving Harden's reputation on this subreddit at least somewhat.|Spurs|2
In all fairness that's not reactionary at this point, everybody just likes to hate Harden regardless.|Celtics|3
Fr. I remember people calling him a ball hog in the Warriors series this year when he was literally the only dude hitting shots consistently. He would be getting double and triple teamed and would pass it out only for Ariza/Brewer/Beverley/Dmo/JET and they would just clank it. Hell, him shooting OVER those double and triple teams would probably be a better shot than anything else. Shit man, I just wanna see a proper offense next year, which MDA will hopefully do for us|Rockets|13
Yeah, that whole series was just James Harden vs the Golden State Warriors. |Celtics|2
Guys. I figured it out. The first game we won, I was broke down on the side of the highway coming back from my sisters baby gender reveal party, learned I was going to be uncle to a niece, and was on a game blackout the entire time.\n\nToday, I forced myself on a blackout of the game.\n\nI will take one for the city of Cleveland.\n\nI will not watch the next two games.|[CLE] LeBron James|320

I got a Lebron jersey the first time he was here. Didn't burn it when he left. Couldn't bring myself to. Then he came back!! But we lost the last 6 games I wore it. Didn't wear it Wednesday.

I\'ve seen this "LeBron" before against the Celtics Big 3.  When LeBron goes into that mode - he really is capable of unbelievable numbers.\n\nMeanwhile, Kyrie Irving was channeling Isiah Thomas\' Final performance.

Amazing.|[MIN] Kevin Garnett|1

wiggy still needs to develop but using that money on another player or two could've been huge.|Timberwolves|1
It was Game 5 Finals LeBron.|Cavaliers|1
Lebron shows up for big games. He kicks it into another gear and is out of this world. His defense was as good as anyone ever just for this one game. Kobe and Lebron when it matters just kick it to another gear. Lebron with his rebounding, defense, points. Kobe with his crazy D, relentless energy, and pace and vision. Funny how they change roles when it really matters. |Thunder Bandwagon|1
Love is just awful out there. He is so fucking weak with the ball in he hands down low. He wasn't attacking the boards with any purpose at all. He's completely indecisive when he gets the ball. He's slow as shit. He is basically a walking liability when he is on the floor. |[CLE] Kyrie Irving|1

You better check yourself before you wreck yourself.  Kevin Love has never lost a home playoff game that he started in.||1
I think you guys should start delly and love |Warriors|1
I agree. How many chances does Love need to get in this series? \n\nJefferson has been more effective in less minutes|Cavaliers|1
jefferson also sucked it up for a large portion of the game|Raptors|3
Jefferson at least plays with more intensity. Love looks like he's just trying to kill some time until his mom comes and picks him up from practice|Clippers|3
Or Kevin Love needs to eat as much food as possible between now and Thursday so he can become Fat Kevin Love again|[PHI] Allen Iverson|398

I wonder if it's some lasting effect of the concussion. Everything just looked off for him tonight. He wasn't even grabbing rebounds...|KnickerBockers|189

Honestly I was surprised he was playing. ||3
Underrated comment. I'm reading League of Denial now, and that shit is not a joke.|Supersonics|3
Would not be surprised at all. Head injuries are no joke.|[GSW] Draymond Green|6
If he still has effects isn't that considered him still being concussed?|Knicks|6
Passing the concussion protocol probably isn't a 100% guarantee the person has completely recovered from the concussion.  Or maybe Love is worried about getting hurt again and as a result is playing more timidly|[PHI] Allen Iverson|7
Concussions are murder. I got one playing football, went back in the game. Every reaction was slow, missed tackles, everything looked hazy. Then I went home and realized I forgot how to type. Like I just sat there staring at my keyboard. I was in a haze for over a week after. In a precision sport like basketball, a concussion would be killer.||6
Dude got out rebounded by Curry mid-4th quarter..|Raptors|64
Exactly, he's not right at all, he wasn't hustling and was sluggish. Some of it is just a slump, but concussions fuck with your focus so much. ||6
Concussions are a bitch for real. Don't even feel like yourself. Shit lasts a long time|Raptors|215
Technically... they last forever :(||2
His judgement obviously can't be trusted if he told the coaches he could play today.|Cavaliers|5
You're right. Had one after I took a charge and hit my head on the floor in a game. I went out and guys wanted me to come back in. No way I could have even if I wanted. Dizziness and positional vertigo lasted weeks. ||14
And they have multiplying effects. After your first concussion it's then easier to get a concussion in the future, and more than one concussion, even one actually, can have lasting effects well into old age.|NBA|6
Can confirm, had 2 concussions my senior year of football and had to quit. Feel lazy as fuck but that's why I'm not an NBA player |[DAL] Dirk Nowitzki|14

Really? Lol||5
Elimination games have such a different vibe when you don\'t have a dog in the fight. Notes:\n\n* LeBron could probably lose all his limbs in a tragic hairline restoration accident and get a head coaching position in a wheelchair. For all his unreal physical attributes, basketball IQ is probably his greatest attribute. And that says a ton. Not to say that he doesn\'t space out, or lose focus at times, because everyone does, but the guy can see shit happening before it does. He can figure out plays before they\'re run, and that\'s not even counting the plays he can blow up because he MEMORIZED THEM. One day soon, we\'re gonna look back at dude\'s career and sit in awe, the same way we did with Kobe. \n\n* Speaking of Lebron, he did everything I wanted and went straight 2012-2013 mode. Jumper was wet, he was aggressive, and he seemed fully willing to drop 60 if needed. Legitimately dirty to watch. Somewhere, Kevin Garnett felt a cold chill from this one. \n\n* Don\'t get it twisted either: LeBron\'s resurgence is directly related to Draymond sitting out tonight. His defensive IQ is remarkable. Honestly, I think Draymond\'s relationship to Steph is similar to that of Pippen to MJ: they can be that terrifying defensively, largely because the best player(s) to guard them happen to be their teammate. Hopefully LeBron can carry that positive momentum in his jumper forward. \n\n* I\'m not sure what to think about Kevin Love. He regularly seemes to alternate between overly aggressive, with a trash BBIQ to match, and completely timid where he seems either prescient or frozen. He\'s talented, for sure, but I think that serious consideration to the offensive and defensive systems need to be made. He really seems like he\'s hitting a glass ceiling in his play, and I really hope he puts it together. What\'s more, I hope that the Cleveland Front Office has a similar faith and keep him. That said, dude was a non fucking factor on both ends. Probably a net negative, knowing that they forced switches to get him on Curry.\n\n* Iggy needs to keep starting imo. I definitely think that his hands, even only on the help side, are enough to keep the Cavs jittery, and off balance. He stuck LeBron a bit too much for my liking early, and didn\'t sag to give help. And it let Kyrie go straight the fuck off. Lue might have the makings of a pick your poison situation here: who do you want to torch you? If Kerr has to stretch Iggy, then, even with Draymond, that\'s a problem for the Dubs. \n\n* Shumpert looking like trash all series. Both with his hair and his game. \n\n* The Dubs were really good tonight. Tons of their usual screen action, cutting, things we\'ve seen all season. But they held on the same way they did against OKC. By being able to sink stupid shots at a huge distance. Being that superior from beyond the arc is really mind boggling. Look. Not to say that the Cavs didn\'t help with that: it\'s an elimination game and people were slow to close out. That\'s losing basketball.  \n\n* Golden State has gotta be happy. You needed a historical game by two superstars for them to steal a game. However, the floor tilts at home. I\'m interested to see how the champs step up. I\'m positive they\'ll come out swinging\n\n* Get better Bogut. \n\n* Refs get a B-/B for the first quarter. Half a grade docked for those Varejao flops, and another half for not calling a foul on that TT block on Klay.  \n\n* Y\'know what? I *almost* wish Golden State had taken us up on Harden for Thompson. Dude fits the OKC profile to a T: long, athletic and smart. The offense is a fucking bonus. Plus imagine Curry having been forced to learn to defend, playing next to Harden. \nSteph-Harden-Barnes-Draymond-Bogut vs. Russ-Klay-KD-Ibaka-Adams (pretend we still draft Adams). We deserve these teams people.\n\n* Andre Igoudala deserves to get seriously paid. Also on that list are Harrison Barnes, (probably) Speights and definitely Livingston. I want to see them get paid, not only because it would break up this unholy alliance of a bench, but also because, these guys deserve it. \n\n* LeBron deserves Finals MVP honors. Again. Fight me\n\n* Steph was relatively quiet again tonight. Not to say that he was a non factor (whattup K.Love), but the defense definitely took him out of his rhythm tonight. Once again, no disrespect, but its another series where Klay has done most of the heavy lifting. King Waffle Cone is gonna snap out of it eventually though. He always seems to. \n\n* Cavs uniforms tonight looked awful. Black with a big C. Really? Those uniforms are the closest thing to the physical embodiment of a double dribble. \n\n* Anderson Varejao is a ho. I honestly didn\'t like him jumping from one 1-seed to another, but to then flop like a flaccid dick in oversized boxers is extra. And then he goes to the line and misses the free throws? Pick a struggle you toilet brush shaped bastard.\n\n* Kyrie\'s development is the Cavs\' future. Honestly, I think that Kyrie\'s shown flashes of something truly special this postseason. It\'s gonna be great watching this kid grow. His jumper was beautiful, he passed into the pocket a couple of times, and, most importantly, he didn\'t sleep on defense. Dude absolutely blacked out, and what\'s worse he made it look effortless. The crazy thing is, that he did it against Klay and company. Draymond isn\'t his primary defender, so, assuming Draymond\'s softer defensive skills (i.e. communication) are equally neutralized by LeBron\'s IQ, then this might be repeatable.\n\n* UnderArmour still makes trash looking shoes. I don\'t care how long your commercials are, or how advanced your metrics, or technological advancements are. The Curry 2s are everything Twitter said they are. You spectactularly lucky sonsofbitches lucked into the most marketable, and singularly popular player since rookie LeBron. And you give him the most Payless looking shoes in the boundlessness of infinite possibility. Those shoes smell like Bass Pro Shops and "All Lives Matter". If Seth is smart, he\'ll take his free agent ass to Nike. \n\nAight, that\'s the analysis. I\'m gonna speak briefly about the LeBron v Draymond clusterfuck that\'s been going on the past few days. This sub has been packed with tweets from no-name writers, washed up ex players, and a bunch of no-flair, dry dick precum babies with nothing better to do. \n\n* I honestly do not care if LeBron got called a bitch. It\'s a grown man\'s league. Shit gets said all the time. LeBron, unfortunately, is too iconic for his own good. I don\'t even really like LeBron like that. I could give a fuck if you have kids: it\'s the Finals.\n\n* That being said, this contingent of people who seemingly are okay with calling people, and being called a bitch, is really confusing to me. Couple things on that note: there are quite possibly less than a dozen people on the continent who would legitimately run up on LeBron talking shit.  Don\'t act crazy, people. \n\n* My flair says everything you need to know about my honest feelings on Draymond. I like his game, but this man has touched more NBA penis in the past month and a half than most groupies. In fact, he got suspended because his last flagrant was literally an egregious and unnecessary touching of another man\'s meat. \n\n* LeBron has the right to not be called out of his name. And that\'s legitimate. But calling him sensitive is probably the most backasswards sentiment I\'ve seen this playoffs since "OKC should double Aldridge", and "Golden State is trash without Steph".\n \n * Sensistive is Klay\'s daddy having an opinion. And what\'s worse is it being a dumbass opinion. The greatest physical specimen in modern sports wouldn\'t be able to handle the physicality of the league? Coming from Mychal "I couldn\'t catch a Magic Johnson pass" Thompson? Aight. There\'s a reason Dell kept his damn mouth shut. \n\n * Steph is no better in my book. IDC how bad your wife is (straight fire), she doesn\'t get to subtweet like a jaded ex. Ayesha Curry probably picks fights with dudes built like Karl Malone and then says shit like "my man\'s gonna whoop your ass". Come get your wife the fuckouttahere. \n\n Had to get that out. Sorry. \n\nSeries isn\'t over until someone wins 4 games. Obviously. And, now, much like GS in Game 6 in the WCF, the Cavs are going back home, riding a high off a road win, and with plenty of positive momentum in both Kyrie\'s performance, and LeBron\'s revitalized shooting. The officiating was crisp, clean, and surprisingly balanced. Don\'t count either team out. Don\'t overreact. Just enjoy the next game. It\'s shaping up to a be a gorgeous one. |Thunder|1672

Absolutely unreal, historic performances from Kyrie and LeBron. This is exactly what they needed to survive a road elimination game.\n\nThat said, I think there\xe2\x80\x99s very little takeaway from this game as it relates to the rest of the series. Draymond being back aside, Cleveland\xe2\x80\x99s offense and defense really didn\xe2\x80\x99t look different in this game than it did in their losses. They gave up a ton of open threes and their offense consisted of off-the-dribble, iso jumpers. The second half was the perfect storm of variance for them.\n\nExcited to see what adjustments, if any, both teams make in game six.\n||113
Cavs don't need to do shit other then start RJ. \n\n|[CLE] Delonte West|-1
There were not a ton of open 3s for klay and Steph |Cavaliers|2
Their adjustments need to be better timing on playing their starters. People look gassed out there. |Hornets|4
Love it. Kerr's deep rotations really start paying off in the late games of the series|Warriors|2
The Warriors had way fewer second chances on missed shots. That destroyed the Cavs in game 4. |Cavaliers|7
Really good point. They just hit shots they have been missing. And not to mention, Barnes was about 0/5 on WIDE open 3s in the 2nd half, and Curry missed 2 wide open 3s.\n\nTo quote the ingenious JVG, "IT\'s a make or miss league"...\n\nNot really. But truthfully, the Cavs hit a lot of tough shots they don\'t normally hit. Phenomenal performance. But replicable? I doubt it. |Bulls|48
I really think they can carry the momentum into Game 6, but won't have to shoulder the load. Role players will have a much larger impact for CLE in Game 6 at home. Then LeBron will set so many records in Game 7 they'll hand him the MVP at halftime |Heat|2
> I really think they can carry the momentum into Game 6\n\n\nUgh. |Bulls|1
What's the ugh for? |Heat|1
There is no such thing as momentum.\n\nHow did the Cavs momentum from game 3 work out for them in game 4?\n\nHow did the Warriors momentum from game 4 work out for them in game 5?|Bulls|1
How was that for momentum? |Heat|1
Cavs won a game on their home court in game 3 so not much momentum would really carry to game 4.\n\nWarriors lost one of their key players in game 4 who some could argue is their heart and soul on the court. \n\nI think the Cavs have some momentum after handing GS their second loss on their home court this playoffs. I think this game, if there ever was one this series, is going to carry some momentum.\n\nLast time I remember momentum being a thing that I can give an example of is was the Heat coming back and winning game 6 of the 2013 NBA finals. What looked like a series they would definitely lose they completely dominated game 7 after that shot by Allen. That was a clear indicator of momentum if I ever saw one. |Heat|1
Barnes seems to only be able to hit the corner threes. Threes from anywhere else on the court he can't seem to make.||2
Put them away in G4 with one from the top of the key. |Bulls|1
It's not that we don't normally hit those shots. It's that we haven't been hitting them this series. Obviously tonight was particularly stellar, but it's not that uncommon for us to go off like that.|Cavaliers|10
It's not uncommon that LeBron and Kyrie both score 40? Pretty sure its only happened one other time ever. |Bulls|1
> Obviously tonight was particularly stellar\n\nAnd look:  \n1st Round vs Pistons: FG% .461, 3PT% .413 (57 3s made)  \nECSF vs Hawks: FG% .461, 3PT% .507 (77 3s made)  \nECF vs Raptors: FG% .497, 3PT% .389 (68 3s made & 2 total shit games)  \nFinals Game 5 vs Warriors: FG% .530, 3PT% .417 (10 3s made)  \n\nOur FG% last game was only ~3% higher than our series % against the Raptors and our 3PT% was actually lower than average for our 2016 playoff % through the 1st 3 series. So yeah, it's not uncommon for us as a team to go off like that.\n\n|Cavaliers|4
Ohhhhhhh....I overestimated you.\n\nI didn't *actually* think you were going to suggest that the Cavs shooting great against those 3 bumass eastern conference teams somehow had a bearing on this series. \n\nMy bad. |Bulls|-2
Because the Warriors played some real stiff competition between the trash Rockets and the Blazers. Or was it the OKC that gave away the series win in game 6 that prove how fucking brilliant Curry and his boys have been this postseason?\n\nBut it really doesn't matter what I say, does it? You're a salty ass, hater, Bulls fan. |Cavaliers|2
No, this has nothing to do with the Bulls.\n\nIt also has nothing to do with who the Warriors played.\n\nYou are using stats from series' against vastly inferior competition, and applying that to this series saying the Cavs should be able to shoot just as good against GSW. That is asinine. |Bulls|-2
So I say it\'s "not uncommon" but I can\'t reference any of the games we\'ve played recently? Makes a lot of sense. But we\'ll set aside that illogical thought process. How\'s this? We have the guy who\'s been to the last 6 NBA Finals, the best player in the world. And the other guy who\'s had 3 straight 30+ games, with a FG% of .487 and 3PT% of .407 in these Finals. Not to mention, we beat the fully healthy Warriors by 30 earlier in the series.|Cavaliers|4
It is very "uncommon" for two teammates to score 40+ in the same NBA Finals game. So uncommon in fact, that it has only happened once, and that was Monday.\n\nYes, LeBron and Kyrie are capable of playing good. But it is clear that the Warriors defense, with Draymond, is on a completely different level then their Eastern Conference competition. So saying "Look, its not a fluke, its a trend, because we shot tons of 3s vs Atlanta" means nothing to me, because what they did in those series\' has very little bearing on what they are going to do against the Warriors.\n\nAgainst the Warriors, they usually lose, unless they get super human performances out of LeBron and/or Kyrie, which over the past 2 Finals and regular season has been proven to be unsustainable.\n\nYou want to believe the Cavs are going to win the next games, and that is fine. I am just being realistic, and its not a coincidence LBJ and Kyrie had huge games the game where Draymond Green was missing, and the odds of them being *that* good again are extremely low.\n\nAnd without them being phenomenal, they aren\'t winning 3 in a row vs a 73-9 team. \n|Bulls|-1
Kevin Love played like the Warriors are holding his sex tape. Klay had the most invisible 37 point game ever. |[SAS] Boris Diaw|321
Klay had 6 3's in the first half. The NBA Finals record for 3's in a game is 8. Klay did not break the record.||1
Warriors just didn't give anymore chances to shoot threes, they kept letting Curry and Barnes brick them.|Trail Blazers|1
How does he have 37 points *and* a -21 +/-? That seems crazy to me. ||2
He got scored on nearly every single time he made a shot. I think it broke him to go off on 3s like that in the first and still be tied.|Hornets|1
It was pretty visible man. Dude was on fire from 3 |NBA|6
Dude was 6-8 from behind the arc at one point...||8
was not invisible in the first half|Cavaliers|22
It wasn't invisible, he was on fire in the first half. It was just that LeBron remembered how to shoot and he and Irving went off while Klay had a pretty normal second half.|Supersonics|222
I don't care if he has forgotten how to shoot he needs to ding take those shots to keep the defense honest ||4

No matter what happens the rest of the series the warriors are the better team I believe.  Losing Andrew tonight hurt you guys badly inside and the cavs took advantage but don't forget about game 3.  Any team can kick ass if the opponent is not ready to play or just doesn't hit shots.|Cavaliers|2
They were not about to take an L lol|Kings|7
The fucking defense in the second half was absurd.|Cavaliers|8
Watching Kyrie going off is one of the best things to watch in the NBA. The degree of difficulty on some shots makes it so goddamn exciting. |[NJN] Vince Carter|144
He takes some tough ass shots. His shot selection is pretty close to Kobe's out there.|Kings|5
yup, he and kobe both go into those blind scoring modes. they don't see teammates, just the rim|[NJN] Vince Carter|6
It's the reason why I prefer watching Klay go off than Steph. Steph makes it look too easy. He has those fancy dribble moves that get him open looks. I mean not open by most players standards, but if there's not a hand directly in the face it's open for those two. Klay on the other hand does his best to shuffle half an inch to the right (and ends up going left on accident half the time), shoots it, and it still goes in.|Rockets|8
I agree to an extent. When Klay is on, his shots don't even touch rim. it's pure butter every damn time and you are in disbelief of what you're seeing. \n\nBut at the same time. I do really like watching Steph do it all. His drives to the rim get so creative that you are still wondering how the hell he even got a shot up. |[NJN] Vince Carter|4
He reminds of Rose with a lot of his shots. Fuck I miss rose|Rockets|12
If Kyrie had Rose's leaping ability and overall explosiveness, this league would be fucked. |[NJN] Vince Carter|6
Well we have Westbrick, so problem solved?|NBA|0
Westbrook isn't nearly the shooter Kyrie is though. Combining Westbrook's athleticism and playmaking with Kyrie's shooting would probably be the greatest PG to step on the court. |[NJN] Vince Carter|13
I'd say one of the best players ever if you add Westbrook's passing to the mix. ||1
Well, I would certainly hope the greatest PG of all time would be considered one of the best ever lol he'd have to pass Magic which is guaranteed top 5 |[NJN] Vince Carter|1
God tier|Rockets|2
Just and incredible game from the big 3 today. LeBron, Kyrie and Love combine for 84 points. :)|Supersonics|246
Lebron, Kyrie, and the Ref more like it.|Heat|-3
Nope, your list does not combine to 84 points..\n\nAlso, the refs were good this game ||3
Wow even beat me and Kobe's tag team high score of 81! ||1
People keep joking but he still has a concussion. That shit doesnt go away, it takes months to fully recover. He probably shouldn't even be playing the rest of the playoffs. |Rockets|2
Hahahaha Love was clutch!|Warriors|2
Wayne Gretzky and his brother Brent hold the the record for the most combined points by two brothers in the NHL with a grand total of 2861.\n\nWayne had 2857 points.\n\nBrent had 4.|Raptors|3

Even if the Cavs don\'t win this year, he\'s still one of the best to ever play the game. He has as many rings as Wilt Chamberlain and as many as Olajuwon and as many as the Bad Boys (other than Dennis Rodman). More than Carmelo, Dwight, Chris Paul, KD, Westbrook and Harden (who still have chances to win one, obviously). More than TMac, Grant Hill, Chris Webber, Vince Carter, Steve Nash, George Gervin, Dominique, Mutombo, Reggie Miller, AI, Ewing, Stockton, Malone, Barkley, and Elgin Baylor combined (no rings between them). Players like Dirk, KG, Paul Pierce, Jerry West, Oscar, Clyde, Jason Kidd, Gary Payton, and Moses Malone only ever won one ring. There\'s never been a player like LeBron before. No one has ever had his combination of size and speed, the closest might be Magic Johnson and James has at least 30 pounds on him. No one has ever had the physical gifts or the kind of game that James has. Even the haters will look back and tell their grandkids "I saw the King play." We\'ll all certainly talk about other greats of this era too, like Kobe and Shaq and KD probably Steph too. We\'ll probably always debate who the best was in this era. But none of us will forget to mention James in that conversation. Our grandkids will roll their eyes at us the way we all rolled our eyes at people who saw Cousy or Oscar or Wilt or Russell play (or for some watching the NBA today, even the stories of Bird and Magic and the Bad Boys and maybe even Jordan too). They\'ll say "Lebron and Kobe combined couldn\'t be as good genetically modified superhuman XXXXX XXXXXX." And we\'ll sit back, sure in our knowledge that our generation was superior to these genetically modified superhuman whipper snappers in the league today. We\'ll smile knowingly, each of us remembering that we saw one of the greatest players to ever step foot on the hardwood. Even the haters.|Magic|11

If you're a Cavs or GSW fan, I get it. The problem is that you have people coming out of the woodwork to hate on one team or the other following a loss. It's embarrassing.|Lakers|2
I'm with you, especially playoff version of this subreddit. I've been getting flair based downvoted for trying to start a discussion. \n\nA couple years ago you  could actually see people talking about the actual game of fucking basketball rather than all this meme spouting karma whoring shit.|Cavaliers|3
it really is|Rockets|76
Let's go start our own subreddit. We'll call it /r/nbyayyy|Hornets|-1
Where can I get my ticket punched for the "Shit on Kevin Love" conference? That\'s today\'s story, right?|Supersonics|6
Reddit these past 2 days has been an overall shitshow|Mavericks|270
It's almost as if this sub was made of different people with differing opinions. I mean, come on, the people shitposting today are not the same people shitposting yesterday.|Warriors|-1
Yeah but it's the same people voting|Cavaliers|1
That first sentence is the most obnoxious, cunty, naive, canned response. Fuck outta here with that shit|Magic|5
You right, I just copied it from someone else here.|Warriors|0
I've seen those exact words dozens of times on Reddit. It's like a trigger for me lol. It's just ridiculous because it's supposed to say that everyone thinks for themselves, yet everyone just copy pastes that exact sentence|Magic|3
I'd say it's been verging on unusable since the initial Dray kick on Adams. I feel like all I've posted in here the past month is for people to stop with the hot takes, and me complaining about how shitty the sub has been. Neither of which should be topics of conversation when such important basketball is going on, but it just seems to taint every thread.|[POR] Thomas Robinson|1
Hey r/soccer has been pretty awesome lately with Copa America and Euros|[SAS] Tim Duncan|1
and that won't change, but in the opposite direction trashing the warriors/praising the cavs. dubs played well, it's just that lebron/kyrie caught fire|Lakers|1
I agree but a good way to not be bothered by that is to just not go on reddit for two days|Pistons|1
Days, years, same thing |NBA|1
It truly has been. I swear, redditors are the biggest bandwagoners ever in all regards. |Thunder Bandwagon|1
The memes grew too strong|Trail Blazers|1
It's a lot like /r/the_donald, except the furious idiotic circle-jerk changes focus day to day.  |Timberwolves|3
School's out for summer. It's like this every year.|Charlotte Hornets|2
It's grown worse and worse every year. Especially the past two. ||1
It's hilarious how all of /r/NBA was pissed when Draymond wasn't suspended and then angrier when he did it again and was suspended. ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINED??|Cavaliers|7
You mean /r/the_donald dominating /r/all for months with memes and posts about "faggots"? Ya Reddit is in some dark times now that every 10 year old is on here daily||38
It\'s so sad how grown men will sit around the computer making "memes", but won\'t knock on a couple doors and make calls for Trumpo. \n\nIt would help with his unfavorable ratings , which are the worst of any candidate EVER.\n\nMaybe hatred and bigotry won\'t win out after all.||1
Plus the r/news censorship stuff. Reddits in a dark place rn|Rockets|1
The censorship is honestly better than those threads just being brigaded by the Donald with anti Muslim propaganda. Reddits problem is that it tries to advertise itself as an open minded website while housing some pretty serious reactionaries. |Charlotte Hornets|33
> "...censorship ... better."\n\nGet the fuck out of there.|Clippers|-2
Wow what a well thought out point I never saw it that way. |Charlotte Hornets|1
Right. A comment directing to blood donation sites was anti-Muslim propaganda. ||-2
Let's just censor facts on one on the biggest new stories in the past few months. It's not like people come to /r/news for news.\n\nPretty funny how The Donald subreddit was the only one covering it. Really funny how /r/news deleted the post about donating blood.||0
Are we pretending the Donald didn't have super biased coverage?|Charlotte Hornets|1
It was the only one covering it, and that's what matters. As soon as reports began to surface that it was a Muslim shooter, /r/news mods began to delete all coverage.\n||1
"I much rather have censorship than see opinions I disagree with" you don\'t deserve to live in a free country.|Cavaliers|1
It's a privately owned website they can do whatever the fuck they want. |Charlotte Hornets|1
So let me see if I understand- You'd have people censored rather than have their idiotic opinions reach the front page just because you don't agree with them? Reddit's problem is that it has too many admins and mods that think like you.|Knicks|1
I disagree, I was one of the many people that was on reddit all morning and had NO IDEA there was any kind of shooting. I'm 60 miles away from Orlando cuz. What happened in /r/news was fucked.|Mavericks|1
I mean do you not go on any other website for news? That's not Reddits fault it's your fault|Charlotte Hornets|1
Oh no you\'re absolutely right about the racism on Reddit. I\'m a Muslim myself so I see it much more than most and r/news is like the worst sub for it, outside r/the_donald. But censorship isn\'t allowed no matter what. We can\'t be saying censorship is fine cause some dude said some racist stuff, that\'s not what free speech is. We can\'t live life in fear of someone saying some mean stuff about us. I\'d rather people are able to speak their mind than having to control everything they say. That\'s not what freedom is and that\'s not the ideals this country was founded on. Who knows when the government try\'s to take our rights away? What then? Will we just let them and say "atleast people won\'t say mean things about me"? Cause that\'s gonna just fuck this country/world up that much more|Rockets|3
The Reddit admins aren't the government. I don't know if any of you are aware but the first amendment does not apply to admins of a forum. They don't have to give a fuck. If it makes their website run smoother than they don't have to care |Charlotte Hornets|1
Sports subreddits are really the only place I can escape that garbage. Thank god for this summer. Copa America, Euro Cup, NBA Finals, and the Olympics?\n\nIt's all I could ever ask for in a non-World Cup year. ||9
RES + filters is a life saver|NBA|1
Eternal September is here my friend.||3
So is everyone at /r/the_donald being serious? It reads like some overly sarcastic parody sub. They all sound like lunatics, and apparently everyone is a "cuck" to them. |Bulls|3
They\'ll say it\'s all for the \'lulz,\' but back them into a corner and they\'re actually very concerned about "white culture" and "white pride" and all that BS.|Rockets|6
Is African culture bs? What about Asian? Why is white culture bs?||-3
I can't wait for the offseason here.|76ers|12
is it better than offseason r/nfl?|Lakers|2
At least we don't have to hear about 400 longsnapper signings here.|Jazz|10
IDK I do like the analytical series.. it makes me feel smart even though idk what they are saying|Lakers|2
[deleted]||4
Honestly, half of the reason I said is because my team is more relevant. And the other half is because the posts and dialogue in r/NBA hasn't been fun.|76ers|2
Honestly I prefer offseason /r/nba. The greatest posts come during those times |Nets|5
And the sub isn't flip flopping narratives every other day|Rockets|4
Off-season OC is the best|Thunder|8
This sub was just a LeBron hate train after Game 4, now everyone will be sucking LeBron's dick until we get the results of Game 6.|Raptors|21
I'd say the entire finals, specially the first 2 day break after game 1.|[MIA] Harold Miner|23
The amount of people who were saying he doesn't show up in big games or was a choke artist was ridiculous, and they were all getting upvoted.\n\nOOOO BABY|Spurs|138
So this is the team people were comparing to the 96 Bulls? Klay's hot streak was the only reason they were even in the game, at home, with an opportunity to clinch a ring and the MVP on the court.|Supersonics|1
Steph Curry on a path to be worst MVP of all time|Hornets|1
Everybody on this sub remembers the last 2 games they watched and nothing more. Actually I'm almost certain a lot of the commenters here don't even watch the games so they basically remember the box score of the last 2 games|[MIN] Sam Cassell|7
Don't worry if he scores 25 next game and they lose he's back to LeCHOKE on this sub. ||8
I wish I could say the narrative would change but he's done it before and it still won't go away. Dude gets unbelievable hate|[CHA] Kemba Walker|62
Barnes, on the other hand, did *not* play like a guy hoping to get maxed this year.|Suns|94
I'm not sure when he ever has played like he earned it. He never seems to have an impact even as Klay and Curry are double teamed, and Draymond/Bogut are using all their energies on hustling and defense. As a 4th year player with a perfect streak of health, there's gotta be times when you come out and show your potential. He's just been invisible all year. When someone needs to be the sparkplug, it's almost always Iggy, Livingston, Draymond, and even Speights. \n\nHis situation reminds me of Terrence Jones from 2 years ago. Dude played decent on minimal minutes being an under 25 player as a 3rd option.  Injury and a shit Rockets season later, his impact is nowhere to be found. \n\nBrad Beal is basically the same way, scoring like 16ppg career over 4 years, never quite taking the next step. Except when someone had to step up in the 2015 playoffs, he got up and avg. like 25/7 while playing great D as the #1 option. I don't know when Barnes has ever shown that he can do that. ||1
if he ever got a max deal I would quit watching the NBA. What a colossal joke that would be. |Timberwolves|1
Hope you like the NFL, MLB and NHL, because after this season, you're going to have to stop watching the NBA.|Heat|2
Get ready, it's going to happen. Young 3+D player is very desirable.|[CLE] LeBron James|13
Missed open 3 after open 3. It's frustrating to watch that as a basketball fan. Must be beyond frustrating to watch that as a GSW fan.|Lakers|5
He was brutal. Missing wide open three pointers, dropping passes, missing around the rim, just bad.|Warriors|9
I wonder how much money that game just cost him?|Heat|1
Definitely reminded me of Game 7 against the Spurs the way he was taking all those shots. Blame him for 2011, but since then he never quits |Heat|57
I think this is his 3rd greatest playoff game ever. Only Game #6 vs Boston and Game #7 vs San Antonio are higher because one of them was blueprint-defining and other was Championship-defining. But man... if Cleveland goes on to win Game #6, the legend of this game will only grow. Felt SO much fun watching it considering all the shit that was posted about him after Game #4 and shit, just look at the front-page and it's old NBA players criticizing him getting upvoted to the top. |Heat|13
Dog. I know it won you a championship and you're gonna overrate it. But you're high if you think game 7 2013 was better than game 5 in 07 ecf. I can't even put into words that game. 1v5 for an entire quarter plus ot. 29 of last 30 and last 25. Against one of the best defensive cores in the last 30 years. Fuck outta here |[CLE] Matthew Dellavedova|8
That and Game 6 vs Spurs I thought was way better. Way grittier and whatnot; I specifically recall G7 being kind of a blowout (Spurs' morale had been broken by then).|[MIA] Justise Winslow|1
Was game 6 13 better than game 5 ecf 07?|[CLE] Matthew Dellavedova|1
I didn't watch basketball back then so I can't personally say (moved to the states in 08 and even then I'd only watch Heat games every so often, my best friend was baffled I didn't know who Lebron was lol), but from what I've heard probably not on a single player performance. It was a crazy ass game thou and personally one of my favorites.|[MIA] Justise Winslow|1
I\'d put 2007 ECF Finals Game #5 up there too. He\'s 22 years old and in his fourth year in the league. It\'s only the second playoff trip for him. He\'s in a series that is tied 2-2 against a team that they lost to in the second round the previous year, and who are in the ECF for the fifth straight year, including two finals trips and title. The whole series was close, with the first five games being decided by six points or less. The Pistons won the first two at home, the Cavs won the next two at home. Game 5 was in Auburn Hills, game seven would be as well if the teams kept trading home wins. The Cavs would have to win one in Detroit to go to their first NBA Finals.\n\nThe Pistons were up by 7 with 3:15 to go in the fourth. The Cavs needed a 10-3 run to tie the game and send it to overtime. LeBron scored 9 of those 10 points. The game ended up going to double OT. LeBron scored 48 points that game, including his team\'s last ***25 POINTS*** and 29 of his team\'s final 30. He\'s the only player to score in overtime for the Cavs. He\'s the only player on the Cavs to score in the last 12:49, and the only player for the Cavs to make a field goal in the last 17:48.\n\nI\'ve never doubted his ability or his will to win since that game. Yeah, he\'s had bad games. Some of his seasons have ended with not such great moments for him and his teams. But the guy proved very early in his career that he was clutch and could carry a team. Yeah, they got wiped out by the Spurs that Finals, but they had no business being there in the first place. LeBron is the only reason that team made it even that far. For all the LeBron doubters and haters, just tell them to watch 2007 ECF Finals Game 5. He\'s always been able to come through when it mattered.\n\nEven if the Cavs don\'t win this year, he\'s still one of the best to ever play the game. He has as many rings as Wilt Chamberlain and as many as Olajuwon and as many as the Bad Boys (other than Dennis Rodman). More than Carmelo, Dwight, Chris Paul, KD, Westbrook and Harden (who still have chances to win one, obviously). More than TMac, Grant Hill, Chris Webber, Vince Carter, Steve Nash, George Gervin, Dominique, Mutombo, Reggie Miller, AI, Ewing, Stockton, Malone, Barkley, and Elgin Baylor combined (no rings between them). Players like Dirk, KG, Paul Pierce, Jerry West, Oscar, Clyde, Jason Kidd, Gary Payton, and Moses Malone only ever won one ring. There\'s never been a player like LeBron before. No one has ever had his combination of size and speed, the closest might be Magic Johnson and James has at least 30 pounds on him. No one has ever had the physical gifts or the kind of game that James has. Even the haters will look back and tell their grandkids "I saw the King play." We\'ll all certainly talk about other greats of this era too, like Kobe and Shaq and KD probably Steph too. We\'ll probably always debate who the best was in this era. But none of us will forget to mention James in that conversation. Our grandkids will roll their eyes at us the way we all rolled our eyes at people who saw Cousy or Oscar or Wilt or Russell play (or for some watching the NBA today, even the stories of Bird and Magic and the Bad Boys and maybe even Jordan too). They\'ll say "Lebron and Kobe combined couldn\'t be as good genetically modified superhuman XXXXX XXXXXX." And we\'ll sit back, sure in our knowledge that our generation was superior to these genetically modified superhuman whipper snappers in the league today. We\'ll smile knowingly, each of us remembering that we saw one of the greatest players to ever step foot on the hardwood. Even the haters.|Magic|11
That was a fuck you game if I've ever seen it. |Spurs|1695

Funny how nobody mentions that when they jerk off Lebron in the comments. Draymond not playing made a massive difference.|Pistons|-1
Jerk off LeBron? He just tied the best Finals stat line ever.|Cavaliers|3
That's great man, what's it worth when they lose the series?|Pistons|-2
All I'm saying is that it's not jerking someone off when you talk about a historic performance. But since you asked, here's what it's worth. Yet another performance to add to the list of things that make haters laughable. \n\nedit: It was too early to be coherent.|Cavaliers|5

Hell yeah. These last few days have done nothing to lessen my hate for everyone associated with the Warriors. Their players and fans think their god's gift to basketball.|Spurs|5
He proved today why he's still the all-around best player in the NBA|Suns|874
And also what a joke Steph Curry's unanimous MVP is...||11
oh come on now\n\ndude led a team to the best regular season of all time while draining 400+ 3s, breaking the old record by a fucking mile. While shooting a damn good TS%.\n\ni don't give a shit if Lebron is still a better player right now, Steph deserved that|Supersonics|19
Unanimous though?|Suns|4
Who should have gotten votes then?? Who??\n\nWho should have gotten first place votes over the player who had probably the most efficient scoring season of all time, along with 73 wins? |Wizards|1
LeBron. |Suns|2
but steph had the better season\n\nit's more an anomaly than anything that every writer happened to agree|Supersonics|1
But Steph is not more valuable to his team than LeBron. At least the way I look at it. \n\nI think you're right though, it was more dumb luck than anything that Steph was voted unanimously. I mean, it is hard not to get caught up in the hype surrounding what he and the Warriors did this year and I'm certainly not trying to argue that he shouldn't have won MVP (even if I do believe LeBron is more valuable), but it's a shame that the first unanimously voted MVP is on a team that would have easily been a top 4 seed without him even on the damn team. Meanwhile, LeBron is yet again dominating a much improved Eastern Conference, leading his team to the best record in his conference, and doesn't even get a single MVP vote...when we all know how well this Cavs team would have done *without* LeBron (hint: not very well).\n\nCurry is great, no doubt, but he is as much a product of his environment than anyone on that Warriors team or in the NBA. He wouldn't have had this season on any other team. LeBron, on the other hand, would still be doing LeBron things no matter what team you gave him. That's what the MVP award means *to me*, greatness regardless of situation. |Suns|1
Unanimous was definitely a joke. Regular season Steph was great, but his greatness is enhanced by a great team. Post season Curry is average. MVPs lead the team on the biggest stage and Steph is sitting on the bench chewing that mouth guard.||3
ya but he's a bitch who gets his feeling hurt.\n\n- /r/NBA|Cavaliers|2
All-around best player to ever play the game **\n\nedit: I never said best to play (although I have LeBron number 2 all time behind Jordan) but I think in terms of every aspect of the game we haven't seen a better all around player in terms of rebounding, scoring, assisting, and defense |Timberwolves|294
Then what you're saying should be *best all-around player* not *all-around best player*, which he's not.|NBA|1
You're goddamn right.|Wizards|3
Agreed on all levels. If his last few years pans out well I'll have him over MJ, but for now he's just behind. Hopefully now people realize and remember why he's in the conversation though.||0
I saw them both at their peak in person, and I'm taking LBJ 1st |Suns|11
Lol this guy's probably no older than 16 irl. ||-6
Which guy?\n\nI'm 35. Irl. \n\nI was in Toronto in 96 Courtside for one of the Bulls 10 losses. \n\nI've seen Lebron in person 15 times. \n\n|Suns|4
And I'm MJ. I remember that game. I think I even remember you. Man that game sucked. ||-2

If we were drafting all time NBA teams, I'd take LeBron 1. 4 D-Leagers and LeBron make the playoffs and may win a round. 4 D-Leagers and MJ wouldn't make the playoffs. |Thunder|0

I did and have. You are out of your mind. He's not even a lock for no 2. Top 10 sure, top 5 is debatable.|Thunder|3
96 mike was not his peak\n\n88 mike though|Warriors|2
I disagree with that, but I will not continue this further.|[OKC] Andre Roberson|12
That sounds crazy and I need to know why lol. Jordan is almost a myth how could anyone compete with that?||6
The thing about Jordan is that his biggest defenders seem to be kids who really never saw him play. They're just spreading what they've heard because some members of media act like the guy never lost. I mean he had teams go out in the first round. LeBron never has. People also don't understand how good the Bulls rosters was as well. Without Jordan they were still really good |Celtics|2
I think the pure fire that Jordan played with was what was incredible to me. Like even when you beat him down he would get up agai, like you could beat him but never break him ||1
Jordan is mythical. He was a god. \n\nWhat Lebron is doing and has done over the last 10 years is Jordan's equal. \n\nI've made a bunch of posts on this topic, but what it comes down to is that Lebron is physically impossible and bends the game around his will in all phases more than anyone I've ever seen.\n\nHe's a force of nature, and you saw it tonight - something, even if the cavs lose this series, even though kyrie had 41, LeBron had 14 more rebs and 2 more blocks and 2 tos, and has played more tha 3k minutes more than any player in the NBA since 2007 -\n\nHe's a titan and were watching history. Enjoy it.|Suns|8
Don't downvote to disagree, no matter how wrong he is|Bulls|7
Man, I'm not fronting. \n\nMike is a god. LeBron is a god. \n\nI saw them both. \n\nI was courtside for this game:\n\nhttp://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/199603240TOR.html\n\nI'm taking Lebron over Mike. \n\n1a and 1b\n |Suns|1
Now I wouldn't say that. I watched Jordan play and the closest LeBron got to Jordan was 2013. His game was damn near complete for the whole season.|[MIA] Voshon Lenard|11
It's arguable, but Jordan and Kobe were hardly one dimensional. It's the size that is James' biggest asset in the greatest conversation. \n\nGreat night for him tonight regardless, earned it. ||2
No hate here because I\'m a big LeBron fan and am hoping the Cavs come back (if only to see LeBron reel off a historic string of games; same reason I cheered for the Cavs last year, because if they won it would\'ve meant that LeBron went absolutely god-mode), but I think "best all around" should still be given to MJ. LeBron has better natural passing instincts than Jordan, but Jordan\'s won a DPOY and had a season where he averaged *32/8/8*. Most impressive post-merger stat line imo (nothing can top Wilt\'s 50/25). He also had 5 other seasons where he averaged 6.5+ assists per game, so although LeBron has the edge in the category, I don\'t think it\'s quite as large as one would expect at first thought. LeBron has played DPOY-level defense in the past, and an argument could be made that he deserved it in \'13 I believe. Overall though, I think Jordan was just too good a scorer and was at worst, as impressive as LeBron at defense (and was slightly better imo), and is a hair behind LeBron in terms of playmaking ability. Once again, no disrespect to Bron, but I think a healthy case can be made for Jordan here as well|[SAS] Danny Green|192
Jordan benefited unbelievably from the refs, making it impossible for anybody to guard him without getting called for a foul. Lebron gets the opposite treatment. ||-3
First off jordan shouldn't even have the DPOY and LeBron was robbed on one. looking at you Marc Gasol aka DPOY but not first team all defense. Secondly Jordan was very succcessful in an undoubtedly watered down league. Look I think Jordan is still the GOAT but I don't think your argument is fair. LeBron with handchecking would also be dominant on defense|Cavaliers Bandwagon|1
I agree with most of your points, but Jordan's DPOY caliber defense tapered off significantly as his career progressed (for his second threepeat he was the third best defender on his team after Pippen and Rodman), and he could only guard perimeter players effectively.   Because of the stellar defenders supporting him he was also able to frequently gamble on jumping the passing lanes and reaching for steals without his team being punished if he missed, which was one of the reasons his steal numbers were excellent (0.3 higher per game than LeBron, who has excellent steal numbers himself).\n\nGiven LeBron's ability to guard every position on the floor at a all NBA caliber I have a hard time seeing a convincing argument that Jordan is an overall better defender than LeBron.  Is Jordan a better perimeter defender?  Yup!  But overall?  Not IMO, Scotties defense is a better comparison to LeBron's game.|Supersonics|1
I was too young to appreciate MJ but could be defend all five positions like Lebron? ||1
No.  He was a perimeter defender.  Pippen and Rodman were the 5 position defenders on the Bulls.|Supersonics|1
LeBron is a more creative playmaker (a lot of Michael's assists were finding the open man out of the double team, much easier to do under that era's rules) but MJ was WAY better at defense if you consider that 2013 LeBron had two inches and about 60 pounds on 1988 MJ. |[CHI] Toni Kukoc|1
Also Jordan won 5 MVPs and legit should have won 8, maybe even 9.|Supersonics|3
LeBron has 4 and should have legit 6, and that's by age 31.|Cavaliers Bandwagon|12
Casual NBA fan here, Lebron hasn't won DPOTY yet? Surprised. |Kings|2
Jordan's shooting was/is way better than Lebron overall as well. Jordan's fadeaway jumper was unguardable. Lebron still has time to develop a great shot but the window is closing fast.|Bulls|3
Kinda hard to say this after the game we just watched, but I think where LeBron pales in comparison to Jordan is the flashy, clutch plays that Jordan and Kobe dazzled people with. LeBron doesn't have an above-average shot (it was there tonight, but it usually isn't). He doesn't break people's ankles or cash in fadeaway 3s from 30 feet, and it doesn't even seem like he has that breathless, edge-of-your-seat playmaking ability. A few cool dunks and real bursts of athleticism when he chases down blocks, but a lot of the time it almost looks like he's playing slowly (I think that's both an ode to his Basketball IQ and his athleticism, but it sometimes dims the spotlight). He's not overtly loud, he's not a showman, and he actually seems pretty subdued and thoughtful most of the time. \n\nI mean compare his statline to Kyrie's tonight, and everyone was talking about Kyrie's game like it was the most amazing performance they've ever seen when LeBron pretty much did the same thing. LeBron is just consistently consistent. No particular skillset maxed out to 100, but a more thoroughly well-rounded, overall skillset than anyone else, possibly ever.||6
I before halftime they were like "Klay has 26! Look out! Klay game!!"\n\nLebron had 22, and it\'s 10 more points than I would\'ve guessed. Just a killer.||2
Really good points, but I think it's still a toss up. While Jordan's definitely the better scorer due to the volume he could put up, I think LeBron's insane efficiency should factor in a bit. His two .640 and .649 TS% seasons were spectacular. Given that he's edged out Jordan a hair in rebounding too, one doesn't seem to be clearly ahead of the other. |Cavaliers|8
That's a really great point, I forgot to factor in efficiency as well. God damn I'm happy we get to see this dude playing (wish I could've seen more of Jordan than I was able to :/)|[SAS] Danny Green|8
Lebrons size, length, and defensive ability(thanks to athleticism) is what makes Lebron a better defender IMO. Lebron has been runner up for DPOY two times I believe, and in a time where they've publicly stated they will never give someone MVP and DPOY again.\n\nBut Lebron like last night, and in the Spurs finals is as adept a rim protector as anyone outside the Elite defensive Centers . Jordan was never that.\n\nIMO Lebron is the most versatile, and complete player ever, and part of that is due to his size and athletic ability, but also his IQ as a magic like facilitator and game manager unseen in a elite superstar who can score like he does.|[CLE] LeBron James|5
MJ also accepted male pattern baldness and shaved his head. LeBron is still lacking in that area. |San Diego Clippers|39
we splitting hairs now?|Hornets|1
MJ couldn't rock the headband, tho|Pistons|14
Did he ever try?|Trail Blazers|1
The fact that we can make such a good comparison of lebron to the best player ever says volumes.  He's an athletic monster and deserves the good recognition not hate.. ||49
Well, it\'s pretty obvious where the hate comes from, and IMO it is justified. Every season that Jordan played that mattered (sorry Wizards fans) was with the Bulls. He didn\'t chase championships, he made them happen. "The Decision" was the single most disgusting display of self-entitlement I have ever seen in sports.\n\nIf anyone is still questioning LeBron\'s skill, they\'re an idiot. But he put himself above the league, and IMO, no player has a right to do that. I do think it is fair to question his character.|Timberwolves|-17
Yeah sorry but that argument is bull shit (no pun intended). The Bulls built a better team around Jordan while he was there, so he didn't have to chase championships. LeBron's second best player was probably Zydrunas Ilgauskas, and LeBron knew he wasn't going to win with that team during his first tenure there. |Timberwolves|14
Question his character? The Decision was stupid, but that's the only bad thing he's ever done. And it wasn't even that bad. You'd beard pressed to find a more upstanding superstar in any sport|Cavaliers|25
[deleted]||24
not to mention all the proceeds from the decision went to underprivileged youth at boys and girls club of america.. yeah, sure, it might have rubbed people the wrong way but lebron is one of the best role models in all of sports |Timberwolves|12
Yeah Jordan threw a fit at home until they did what Lebron basically did in Miami, what the Cavs wouldn't do||11
Pretty sure if Scotty showed up in Cleveland Lebron would have stayed. |Magic|14
Never even needed proof. Hes obvious still the best in the game and for anyone to argue otherwise is ridiculous. Yes, Steph won MVP and I understand that. But everybody knows Lebron is the best in the business.|Bulls|11
I honestly think LeBron basically entered the MJ zone as far as MVPs go.  Where the press just gets tired of giving it to the same guy every single year so they ignore him.|Rockets|9
Stop putting unnecessary labels. He IS the best player in the NBA. Steph is arguably the best pure scorer right now but he has a great supporting cast. We saw tonight that Draymond is a glue to this team and without him they're not the same defensively. This might sound reactionary, but Steph isn't in the same category as LeBron when it comes to leading a team both on and off the court. |Cavaliers|17
Steph is the best shooter.  No way is he a better straight up scorere than LBJ, KD, Westbrook.|Knicks|4
True but pre-"injury" Steph was one of the craftiest finishers at the rim too and at the end of the day, putting the ball in the basket is what constitutes a scorer and Steph does that better and more consistently than anyone else in the League. KD and LeBron have more versatile ways of scoring, but Steph\'s ability to hit the 3 is what gives him that edge for me. |Cavaliers|1
Only having two turnovers was HUGE|Heat|269
Needed 3 to break Magic Johnson's record|[BOS] Evan Turner|1
He saw a post on here about his turnover record.\n\nLeBron nodded.|Raptors|6
The LeBron nodded needs to stay a thing here.\n|Bulls|1
And one was the first possession. Just one the rest of the way.|Pistons|157
The second was near the end when they were up like 15 too|Cavaliers Bandwagon|2
The second was in absolute garbage time too. |Hornets|87
Not to take anything from Lebron, he shot extremely well. That said, the Cavs barely ever passed because LeBron and Kyrie were so hot. Hard to get a turnover when you're running up and taking a shot or on ISO.|Warriors|-4
7/2 assist/turnover is still good. If he passed enough to get 7 assists and only had 2 TOs then that's really good.|Heat|4
and all seven were in the second half|Pistons|4
LeBron lead or tied his team in Points, rebounds, assists, steals and block, what a huge fucking game by him|Pistons|57
Both teams.|Cavaliers Bandwagon|5
And that's with one teammate getting 41 points and another getting 15 rebounds... unreal.||8
KYRIE YOU'RE FUCKING FIRE. \n\nLEBRON YOU PLAYED GREAT AS WELL. \n\nKEVIN YOU WERE SHIT AS USUAL|Thunder|165
I mean Kevin did an ok job of staying out of the way for the most part. Did better in terms of defense and setting screens. You could tell he was trying to put his ego aside tonight |Cavaliers|1

Nope because I don't believe Warriors fans suck either. Any time someone tries to defend their team against the hive mind they get lit up. It's ridiculous.|Raptors|5
You\'re probably right. this sub is pretty reactionary. But i\'ve never seen a time where every single post had a top comment that said "LeBron is a pussy ass bitch". that shit sounds like 4chan not r/nba. well maybe not. this place is nasty sometimes |Cavaliers|4

Use reddit is fun. It just shows the subs you subscribe to when you open the app. You have to go to r/all manually to access it, and frankly I never do. My subs are enough for me.|Thunder|3
You can do it in Alien Blue, but not the official Reddit app. I think it's called Content Filter or something like that in the Settings page of Alien Blue. You just enter in the subreddit name there.|Lakers|3

This game just confirms Draymond's value to the Warriors' system|Warriors|337
I mean, I guess for the dummies who didn't know how valuable he was before this game.|Nets|1
That, and you  shouldn't piss off LeBron|Bulls|1
MVP of that team. ||1
$$$$$|Supersonics|0
well good thing we signed him to a team friendly deal last year ||1
That also shows how beneficial driving at him can be next game. Get him in foul trouble early and out of there early. \n\nBtw- seems that Green and Thompson are the most valuable on that team. When Curry isn't dropping 25ft shots he's nowhere to be found besides chewing on that mouthpiece on the sideline. |Clippers|5
Curry just being out there is still producing max spacing, which produces open looks for other guys. Klay does the same. Guys that guard them are not allowed to help off under any circumstances|Warriors|5
Valid point, but if Curry's shot isn't falling he can't impact the game in the way Thompson can. Green and Thompson are the most valuable players on Golden State (at least this playoffs) because of their elite two-way play. |Raptors|3
Kevin Love ropes Dray into a ball kick Tech 2.\nDRAY SUSPENDED REST OF SERIES.\nCAVS WIN.\nLOVE WINS PLAYOFF MVP.||11
Plsssss|Clippers|1
So true. I think he brings an essential hustle to motivate his team. I swear the Warriors literally scored 1 point in the last five minutes of the fourth. I think Draymond would have screamed his team to try harder. ||3
Seriously, they missed him sorely. Of course Lebron and Kyrie had amazing games, but you could see how Lebron was not being challenged at the rim nearly as much as he was before.|Warriors|11
Which is why I like discussing what MVP actually means, I honestly think Draymond despite all the reasons I dislike him had just as much justification as Steph for 'most valuable'. Without 1 of them you don't get to 73. The difference is that if you don't have Steph for a week you can probably win all your games that week. I think if you don't have Draymond you have a good chance of dropping one, I think that's the difference.|Cavaliers|6
True, no way James and Irving would have scored 41 each if Draymond was on the court.|Warriors Bandwagon|112
But didn't LeBron score 40+ two or three times last year. And that's with Kyrie & Love out with the defense focused all on him. I wouldn't say there's no way he would have done it.|Cavaliers|-1
He shot an absurd amount of shots to get those.  40+ points on 35 shots isn't really a great offensive performance.  ||4
Since when is shooting over 50% not great?|Hornets|1
There's a 3 point line and a free throw line.  40 points on 35 FGA is probably less than 40% for Lebron's typical shot selection.  ||1
People say Kobe is great for shooting barely 40|Hornets|1
I agree that it may not have been a great shooting performance but to say that there was NO way he could do it is false.|Cavaliers|5
Kyrie would have but not Lebron. |Supersonics|16
Yeah, there's even a chance Kyrie would've had more than 41 because in this game he had to share offense with someone else who was also unstoppable. If LeBron was somewhat neutralized, Uncle Drew gets the ball even more.|Cavaliers|8
And more importantly, Draymond's presence seems to make the Warriors tick emotionally. They just seemed kind of lost out there in the 4th quarter without him.|Lakers|28
Yea I think draymond is the one that fires them up||8
He's the older brother that fucks with you at home but kicks everyone else's ass when randos give you shit.  His presence is definitely missed on court.||1
You mean nuts right?||3
When you're right, you're right.||1

That would be so fun on here|Warriors|6
At the same time, it shows you why Cleveland ran through the east in general. Without Draymond, Kyrie and LeBron just took what they wanted. Basically without a top 3 defender, there is no way to stop the Cavs. |Warriors|50
Our small ball ain't shit without Draymond at center. |Warriors|88

Kinda give that one to iggy |Rockets|23
He just did something no one has ever done in the finals. Good fucking lord some people will hate on anything.\n\nEDIT: Lot of you saying that there best defender was suspended. Lot of you conveniently forgetting that Iggy is their best defender against Lebron. Draymond would have helped and certainly have lessened Lebrons prodcution, but let's not act like he just put up that statline against a shitty defensive team.|Spurs|236
Yeah, but it wouldn't have happened with Draymond out there. LeBron's biggest play of the game was getting him suspended||-10
Green would have helped for sure but LeBron had his jumper falling. That created more driving space because guys started to play him ever so closer. Green wasn't going to stop LeBron from driving AND suffocate his airspace at the same time. LeBron with his jumper falling is an impossible task for any defender in NBA history. Just plain impossible.||2
Green got himself suspended ||3
He's correct. Let's see james doing that against Green on Game 6.|Warriors|1
I don't think it is hating to point out that GSW didn't have their best defender on the court. If Lebron did that while Green was in then there'd be no question about the hate. That said Lebron played a hell of a game but that doesn't mean we can't state the obvious about Green not being in the game.|Celtics|1
Is it not the truth was the best defender on the other team no on the court? |Lakers|1
Uhhhh if you're talking in terms of guarding Lebron, then I think Andre Iguodala was on the court. But yes Draymond was not there, which would have helped. Still, it's not like Lebron was facing a high school team. He just dropped that crazy statline... in the finals. |Spurs|6
does bkref keep stats on lobbying to get people banned from the next game? I find it hard to believe this was a first for a finals game. |Bulls|1
...the other team literally had their best defender suspended. It's not really outrageous to mention this when discussing lebron's performance today. |Celtics|2
I mean, is still notable. Warriors were playing Iggy at C for long stretches.|Pelicans|4

Well no. Lots of us respect that LeBron had a great fuck you game for what happened the last few days. But don't take away the best defender on a team then tout your score line like he wasn't getting destroyed the past few games by said defender. Great show by LeBron. Now let's see if he can continue it Thursday against Green, momentum might push this to 7, Love needs to step up though.|Warriors|3
Warriors fans need to support their team through the end of the game even when losing.\nAnd yeah, Jefferson should start and have love come in off the bench with more touches.||2

Ya Iggy is definitely their best one on one defender for Lebron, but Draymond is definitely what makes their team d work. They were lost without him in the PnR, and need him desperately for switches. |[BOS] Jae Crowder|0
Draymond isn't even the best lebron defender on that team. |Trail Blazers|18
He allows Iggy to focus better. Defence is a team thing.|Raptors|-1
Some people will hate on **EVERYTHING** LeBron does, no matter what. ||9
So we're gonna act like Iguodala doesn't always guard LeBron anyways? \n\nCome on man. |NBA|42
Not to take away from Lebron's monster game but help defense is important too. Dray was huge defensively on the Cavs Big 3.|Kelenna Azubuike|-1
It's not about who guards him. They were running pick and roll at the center all day. Bogut, ezeli, varajao, speights, all of them got clowned over and over.\n\nIf draymond is playing, they switch, and that's it.|Knicks|-4
Oh so the 5 times Draymond guards him didn't happen this game. Got it. \n\n|NBA|4
It's about golden state switching everything. Like they have been for four games. Draymond guards him way more than 5 times, and helps at the rim way more than 5 times. You can't be serious. It's the exact reason the draymond at center lineups are the only positive lineups for golden state in this entire series.|Knicks|-1
Pretty sure iggy played|76ers|20
And all it took was the league getting rid of Green for him. |Supersonics|1
Green got rid of himself by consistently being a crotch-hitting asshole.||13
>consistently\n\nThe first "incident" was literally nothing and the second was a relatively normal, but unnecessary kickout. We saw Westbrook do like the exact same thing the next game. I know that people want to hate Green, especially when he was going against the goofy quote man, but the timing of his suspension was ridiculous.|Supersonics|-6
The timing was just based on when he reached the point of suspension...||3
It was garbage, was what it was|Mavericks|-5
And don't forget 3 blk and 3 stl while doing only 2 TOs! Mind bendingly good game! |Spurs|3

To be fair, Draymond wasn't playing. I think he would have had a significant impact on the game. |Celtics|75
Yeah absolutely. James cried for him to be suspended so he could show off, wait until Green is back. This subreddit forgets how inconsistent Lebrun is. He will choke this series and fuck it all up....just like many times before.|[GSW] Chris Mullin|1

Yeah, I really don't like Draymond, but I disliked the NBA's suspension of him for this game even more, but it's strange how most of the reaction in here seems to completely disregard the fact that Draymond was not in the game.|Trail Blazers|5
The back to back MVP and so called best player on the planet was though right?|[NYK] Patrick Ewing|-1
UNANIMOUS MVP!\n\nI was at the Cavs watch party at the Q, and there was a moment when Lebron made a dunk or something and got fouled, and the entire audience starting chanting MVP...it was amazing. |Cavaliers|2

Come on man, are you seriously trying to take away from LeBron's game last night.  He was hitting jumpers like it was 2013 and it was incredibly fun to watch.  I don't even like LeBron!  But doesn't mean it's not fun to watch him play great basketball.|[CHI] Michael Jordan|1
He actually did it last year without any help.|NBA|12
Yes. 2015 nba champion cavs. K||-10

He's the MVP again this year. If you spent time here after Cavs losses, you'd think LeBron is the worst player in the series.|Raptors|1
It was awesome.  It felt like the re-emergence of Villain LeBron, which I still think is his best state.|[CHI] Michael Jordan|1

I mean his primary defender in the series and an all nba defender wasn't playing. People are actually surprised LeBron went off?|Pistons|2

Because real fans do what the Toronto fans did after losing an elimination game.|Cavaliers|4
um that was the end of their season. different situation entirely. plenty of raps fans have people who left early when the pacers and heat were closing out games in toronto|Lakers|0
There were also plenty of Dubs fans that didn't try to beat the traffic, because that's what real fans do. It's the NBA Finals for fuck's sake.|Cavaliers|3
Yo man that shit was beautiful. Hopefully if things don't work out Thursday we see our fans at the Q do the same. |Cavaliers|3
you can't blame cavs fans if they don't (even if r/nba does). raptors were happy to get as far as they did, whereas anything shy of a title is upsetting for a lebron team|Lakers|1

Ok|Warriors|-7
Yeah man 9pm is rush hour in California don't you know /s|Cavaliers|6
Nah. There was an A's game happening at the same time and everyone was trying to make it on BART before the trains turned into sardines.|Warriors|-4
They weren't that loud this game |Hawks|1
The Oracle got its reputation before they became $18,000 seats.|Pistons|20
Oh its always been loud! Not this loud. It's noticeably louder than thunder games and I've been to a thunder playoff game. The people are all going fucking nuts, one of the loudest arenas I've ever been in. If the noise isn't pumped in, I have no idea how they can get that much more noise in an older stadium with less acoustics with the same number of people inside. It just makes no sense.\n\nLike I've been on the field at nfl games that were less raucous that my nosebleeds at the thunder |[WAS] Gilbert Arenas|7

nah fuck that, he had to get dray suspended just to win. Im calling it warriors win game 6 and dray gonna come back with a just as good performance|Lakers|-4
Just as good as what? LeBrons performance? You can't be serious.. He will never play a game close to the level of the game LBJ just played |Cavaliers|1
It is pretty lame to excuse the game result because one player was missing. So the warriors could not adjust to missing one player to win game 5 at their turf? No one from the warriors is excusing their performance on this and neither should you. Of course game 6 will be different. In the mean time, you need to drink the cup Lebron just gave you.||1
Cavs fans excused the entire 2015 finals cuz love and kyrie were out...\n\n|Lakers|-1
Not sure what your point is. The warriors knew in advance about missing a player, it is game 5, and they played in SF. They have 4 games of experience against this current Cavaliers team and they could not adjust? ||1
Although it worked out for them tonight, the Cavs did exactly the same thing that has lost them 3 games this series: James and Irving iso's in the 4th quarter. I highly doubt Kyrie and LeBron can keep up that ridiculous efficiency for 2 more games though, especially with Green coming back next game.||10
I disagree, a lot of their Isos at the end were to kill the clock, however through most of the second half it was ball movement into favorable match ups and then "Ido" shots. It was a little different from game one.|Cavaliers|3
This probably just gave Lue the idea that they can probably pull if off next game. Guy has straight up not adjusted at all this series. |Bucks|5
Thank god Lebron had another one of his signature games so the dumbass trolls will shut the fuck up!\n\nAnd shout out to Kyrie too holy fuck some of the shots he made were completely out of this world.|Magic|160

I first thought the trolls will shut the fuck up. But wait and see how everyone makes it look like the ONLY reason Cleveland won was because Draymond was out. I always that the LeBron haters just went away after 2012. But they're just waiting for him to fuck up and the trolls be trollin'. Very sad really.|Suns|7
they're already saying exactly that|Nuggets|2
some no flair guy already tried to say that down below. It made a difference but they would have let him take those jumpers even if Draymond was there. Dude was just making almost all of them.|Magic|3
that three while falling down was insane. |Cavaliers Bandwagon|31
Most of his shots were insane man.||6
Why are the Warriors 2-0 without the first ever unanimous MVP and 0-1 with out Draymond "Dick Hunter" Green? ||74
You made me think||1
Because Cleveland is way better than Houston ||1
Well, if Curry is the MVP, and the heart of the team, it's pretty clear that Green is its crotch. |Cavaliers|2

Really? Vara hoe can play 3 minutes and flop 3 times. I'm pretty sure you can use fingers to still count the times Lebron has hit the floor all series (granted id be using probably all of them, maybe a couple toes), and a lot of those were for loose balls. And this is while averaging over 40 minutes a game. Yeah, Lebron flops sometimes, but comparing the two is crazy talk. Inspired by drinking WAY too much hater-aid.||5

You seriously think kyrie had a more impactful game tonight than lebron? How? |Timberwolves|1
Both played out of their minds, but it seemed like the Cavs never looked back after Kyrie's run of points early in Q4.|NBA|2
Today, yes.  He literally could not miss a shot and he took some crazy shots.||3
They both had 41 points and Lebron impacted the game in other ways more. It just wasn't as flashy as Kyrie. \n\nWe saw two all time great Finals performances tonight by two guys on the same team. |Timberwolves|1

There were a couple missed calls here and there but overall this game was called as evenly as one could hope for in the NBA Finals. Great job to the refs.\n\nGotta give it up for LeBron and Kyrie.\n\nI wish LeBron would go to the press conference and open it up with "So is that what a bitch does when they\'re facing elimination on the road?" but I know something like that would never happen. Great game. We\'ve got another one.|[LAL] Kobe Bryant|62
One thing that bugged me was how both Javie and the commentators somehow missed the head contact on the last two flagrant reviews. Replay clearly showed contact to the head/face, yet they all agreed that there was none.\n\nAm I taking crazy pills or were they seeing a different angle than what was shown on TV?|Lakers|1
No way dude, Anderson definitely got fucking whacked in the head. Even the dudes in the game thread missed it, I think I went negative for talking about how Anderson obviously got hit in the side of the head with force. I was checking /r/nba/new at the time and there were hate threads towards him with everyone saying he was acting and never even got hit.\n\nI mean they showed 3 - 4 different angles and in each one you could see him clearly get hit.|[LAL] Kobe Bryant|3
You could see his head snap to the side from the force of the hit... lol|Magic|0
yea, ten seconds after the hit actually happened... and not to the same area as he pretended it did|Wizards|0
I mean I know the dude was acting about how hard he was hit, but to say he wasn't hit is crazy.\n\nThe previously reviewed play where Kevin Love raked his bicep across Steph's face before hitting his shoulder they kept saying he only hit his shoulder. I don't have a horse in this race, but I want to make sure my eyes are not deceiving me.|Lakers|1
To me, it looked like (JR? TT?) jumped and put his arms up, and just naturally brought them down on the ball when he saw Flopejao was bringing it a lot lower. Because of Flopejao's horizontal momentum under the hoop, his face RAN INTO the arm that was over his shoulder in that moment, causing it to look like he got smacked in the face. But really he just got wrapped up in the middle of a fast move, then way overacted the ensuing fall and didn't even grab his ear until well after he was down.|Cavaliers Bandwagon|5
I would love if he opened it up with, "Well, this is a grown man\'s game, right?"|Lakers|10
Time to pile on Steph.\n\nBut seriously, why wasn't he the ball handler in the 4th?  They needed him to go off, and he couldn't get separation with Shump on him.  Shump is a perfectly fine defender, but we've seen Steph shred way better defenders than that.|Pistons|8
Can't really discount the fact that his team's two best PnR pairings and off-ball screeners were suspended and hurt, respectively.  Makes it harder for him to get open and get open looks.|[CLE] Mark Price|3
Yup. No moving screens means less open shots.|Rockets|2
The Warriors don't actually use that much PnR though.  The off-ball screening hurt a lot but still... we've seen Steph ignore the defense before and 4 minutes left down 10 is when he needed to do it.  He wasn't even touching the ball some possessions down the stretch.|Pistons|2
Damn it would be incredible if this series went to seven games. Only a few days ago it seemed like this would be an easy 4-1 win for the Warriors, but after tonight I honestly don't know who I'd take in a potential game 7. \n\nSay what you want about the win being tainted because of the Warriors losing Draymond but performances like LBJ's and Kyrie's are why I love playoff basketball and will always love playoff basketball.\n\nGame 6 here we come!|Wizards|9

I got pretty comfortable when they sat their starters. On that though, didn't they have 3 minutes left and Thompson was shooting the lights out? Why not try and finish it? ||1

Found the box score watcher. Curry was not good.||2
Curry threw the game away with all his missed shots though. |Rockets|2
he did force a lot of shots, but i dont blame him.  besides klay no one else was generating any offense.  the only other warrior in double figures not named klay/curry was iggy||1
Dont remember but when I last checked Curry was like 8 and 21 from 3 or something ridiculous. They could get used those poses tons to drive and foul instead of giving easy rebounds to LeBron.|Rockets|1
Some say Harrison Barnes is still missing open 3's|Lakers|14
Series is going to 7 games. I don't see the Cavs losing game 6, if Kyrie and Lebron continue with the dad-dicking. I think that Draymond may play cautiously because another flagrant means a game 7 suspension. \n\nJust a shame that Draymond put himself and the team in that situation by not being able to control himself. If I am Lue, then I definitely make sure to tell my players to antagonize him in game 6. \n|Spurs|44
> I don't see the Cavs losing game 6, if Kyrie and Lebron continue with the dad-dicking\n\nSaid dicking doesn't continue when Draymond is back and contributing to the defense. And Lebron+Kyrie ISO hero ball is not something that can be consistent. Same ISO hero ball got them thrashed by the Warriors earlier in the series, it worked tonight (very well btw) because they were shooting so crazily well.|Warriors|0
How likely do you think they are to put up the same performance? Look at how many shots Kyrie missed. He and LeBron were absolutely incredible. I think with draymond back, the low likelihood that this pair put up another classic performance, and the way the warriors typically respond to losses a close out is likely. I definitely want to believe this, at least|Warriors|2
Probably not overly likely, but if someone other than Kyrie/LeBron can actually show up on offense, they won't have to score 41.\n\nAt this point...I've got zero predictions for what happens. I could see Draymond firing the team back up and they close it on the road. I could see the Cavs continuing the momentum on their home court. \n\nHonestly, I'm just hoping it goes 7. I don't want basketball to end.|Trail Blazers|8
I mean, 53% shooting beats 36% shooting damn near every time. I can't say with ANY confidence that scenario will happen again.\n\nThey get Dray back game 6 and I don't see the Cavs shooting that hot and the Warrirors that cold again. Let's be honest with ourselves here.|Knicks|10
Game 3 obviously means something, too. I see game 7 coming...|Cavaliers|1
Klay was not cold that game||2
Those are the team shooting numbers, 44/83 for the Cavs, 32/88 for the Warriors. Clay was by no means cold, but he wasn't the only guy out there, unfortunately.|Knicks|3
Remember the Warriors are gonna be missing Bogut as well.\n\nEdit: see, I told you |Bucks|1
Bogut has barely played in this series |Heat|1
But he played well when he was out there. |Bucks|1
They can't continue Kyrie/LeBron ISO and expect to win.  Only works when they shoot out of their mind.|Cavaliers|34

How the hell is Harrison Barnes worth anything more than $2?|Raptors Bandwagon|18
How much for K Love then ?|Cavaliers|2
With the T Wolves like $20M, with the Cavs maybe $20. More than fucking Barnes tho lol, a "good" game for Harrison Barnes is like 3 points 4 turnovers. At least Love used to be good.|Raptors Bandwagon|4
What a game from Kyrie and LeBron. Many people (myself included) consistently doubt LeBrons mental toughness but yet again he puts on that stone cold face and puts up huge numbers. LeBron played that game beautifully, he picked his spots correctly and hit jumpers confidently like he is fully capable of. When you come at the King (I\'m talking to you Warriors fans) you best not miss. Boo LeBron and you have the assassin on your hands. Kyrie fed off that calm and controlled vibe of LeBron and absolutely ICED the game in the 4th with those 3 straight buckets. The handle on that boy is ridiculous, he may not be a "top 5 point guard" but that man can straight up play basketball, he gets buckets which is ultimately what the game is all about. What a game, stealing a game decidedly in a RAGING Oracle arena. Can\'t wait to see how both teams come out next game in the Q|[MIA] Dwyane Wade|19
He only did it because draymond was out, they only won because draymond was out period, if the cavs win this series im done with nba. Some serious nonsense.|Pistons|-5
What's the excuse for when we smoked them by 30 in game 3?|Cavaliers|5
i mean, they didn't have their top 2 defender in the league tonight and still kept it close. let's not pretend like lebron going in was by accident|Lakers|1
True, but next game they don't get Bogut's 14 minutes of solid rim protection so the Cavs will still get some good looks at the rim in Game 6.|Raptors|1
I know it was easier for LeBron to attack the rim but he was hitting jumpers today and there is nothing any team in the league can do against a hot LeBron|[MIA] Dwyane Wade|2
100% props to lebron man, he's the best player in the league. I just wanted to point out that this was a situation where the 2nd half ends with the game tied, then early in the 3rd bogut goes at around 10 mins, mayhem ensues with no defensive anchors for the dubs.|Lakers|2
If Love recovers fully from his concussion and contribute on the offensive end, I think we'll be looking at Game 7.|[MIN] Kevin Garnett|3
So annoyed by Cavs jacking up long jumpers against GSW super-small lineup. Makes no sense... It worked because Kyrie was on fire but that doesn't make it smart.|Suns|14
As Currys season has shown us..\n\nIt's smart if it goes in.|Cavaliers|14
That's not going to work for these Cavs for 2 more games though. Need to truly take advantage of the size mismatches|Suns|2

Honestly thought she's right. Every year we talk about how shitty the refs are because it gets to the point where they are insulting our intelligence with how they call the games. First 2 games of the series most calls went GS's way. Last 3 games they went Cleavland's way, especially last night's game. The refs need to be punished for screwing up big time.||-5
So agree. Particularly where the refs bailed out the Cavs by pardoning them of their offensive possession when Kyrie dribbled the ball within about 10 inches of the sideline and then again when Iggy threw up a shot attempt that hit neither defender nor basket and then caught it a few steps later.  Like, just what Ty Lue wanted.|[POR] Arvydas Sabonis|6

Warriors really didn't help Klay at all. He's been the MVP of the playoffs for the team and they just still give him any offensive help in the 3rd quarter at all. Curry was more or less pedestrian this game and missed a shit load of open 3's. Iguodala also made some stupid plays, Barnes was ass. Literally everyone on the Warriors played bad except for Thompson. \n\nThat being said, Irving cooked their ass. Warriors would've won no matter how great James played this game if Irving didn't ball.  |Wizards|5

That was a really gutsy win from the Cavs today. Kyrie was insanely good, as was LeBron. I really hope they can take the next game at home, but I can see the Warriors winning Game 6. If the Cavs take it to 7, that would be very impressive and anything can happen in Game 7. I'm not exactly a fan of either team but I would really love to see the Cavs win this series. \n\nI've watched LeBron's whole career and have never been a fanboy or a hater, but nobody can deny the dude can fucking ball. In my opinion, he is definitely the best player in the league and easily in the top 3-5 most skilled players ever (I'm talking purely based on skill-set here). Curry has had two phenomenal seasons, but to me he is overrated. That's not taking anything away from the guy and what he can do, but I just can't believe that he is spoken about as an 'all-time' player so often in the media. He needs several more seasons playing at this high level to be in that discussion, IMO. \n\nI will always prefer guys that take it to the hole over 3-point shooters so maybe I am biased in that respect. Don't get me wrong, Curry is probably already the best shooter ever and he is very good at other things also. But to me, watching LeBron play basketball is like watching Messi play football, you can just see that he is the best.||6
GSW didn't have Green or Bogut for most of the game yet they still made it a game until the last few minutes.  The difference between these teams is that Cleveland need big games from Lebron AND Kyrie to pull of wins like this one, which won't work for winning 73 games. While Golden State simply play great team defense and offense which worked incredibly well for them this season.|Spurs|1
Golden State are the better team *by far*, without a doubt. They had the best season ever for a reason, and nobody could deny that they deserve another championship. Personally, I'd just prefer to see Cleveland win the series.||1
On what merit?  That they have Lebron on their team? |Spurs|1
On what merit? Seriously? Since when do people have to prove why they want a certain team to win?\n\nIt's pretty common for people who aren't emotionally invested in either team to root for the underdog.\n\nEDIT: As I said, Golden State would definitely be deserved winners. Does that mean that everyone has to be rooting for them to win?||3
The Warriors had to play 17 games to reach the finals, while the Cavs only had 14.\n\nCurry sustained both ankle and knee injuries during the playoffs that forced him to miss 6 games.  They were also down and out against OKC when they were 1-3 before making that incredible comeback.\n\nI don't know, GSW do have a good underdog story getting here.  They also have a system that lets everyone play well that some people don't like, while in Cleveland Lebron IS the system which some people seem to fantasize a little too much.|Spurs|1
Like I said, the Warriors are a fantastic team. I'm just not a big fan of teams that shoot so many 3's, but hey if I was from the Bay Area I would be very stoked that my home team was playing so well and winning so much. \n\nIf you want to boil it down to one player, ie LeBron, then yeah I do feel that someone as good as he is deserves another championship in his resume. But I guess the main reason is that as a neutral fan for this series, I want to see as many games as possible. What neutral fan wouldn't be hoping for a game 7? And if it goes there, I would be excited to see Cleveland become the first team to win the Finals from 3-1 down. Also, I am Australian and would like to see Dellavedova get a ring. Bogut got one last year, and I'd like to see Delly get one this year.\n\nI think you've got me pegged wrong, I am definitely not a LeBron dick-rider nor am I a Warriors hater. Just a long time fan who is neutral when it comes to these 2 teams. I was actually hoping the Spurs would win at the start of the season.||1
Kevin Love 32 min - 2 points, 3 rebounds and 1 assist ? \n\nHow can a player be so inconsistent as this guy? I don\xc2\xb4t know who is coming next but Love will probably be traded.\n\nAs for the win it was impressive but losing game 4 made me lose 99% of hope.|Cavaliers|5

Because he wasn't making bad decisions on the court. He wasn't taking bad shots, when he got the ball in a bad spot, he moved it around.|Cavaliers|3
Regardless of who wins, and even if he can't do it 82 games a year, Lebron has show he is the best player in any given series.  We've now had 11 NBA finals games between Curry and Lebron and it's clear who the better player is.||3

Nah, JR got us off to a great start and Jefferson was solid throughout. Even though love struggled offensively, he did a good job on D (as good as you can do with GSW).

That was an amazing game, and the Kyrie and LeBron played great, but they went about 6 minutes in that fourth quarter where I don't think the Cavs made a single pass on offense.  That shit isn't going to fly with Draymond back, it's the same reason that they got stomped in the 4th quarter of game 4.  Just this time the shots were falling, but they weren't high percentage shots.\n\nSecond point, LeBron was a monster defensively this game too, that was just a ridiculous performance on both ends.|Knicks|7
It's because Lue keeps giving minutes to the wrong guys and isn't giving enough minutes to the guys who are effective, so LeBron ends up being gassed. \n\nRJ was 4 of 5 for the game, 4 of 6 if you count the random 3pter he missed. Only played 15 minutes. Mozgov still getting no playing time. Delly never returned after the early fouls, etc. |Cavaliers|1

Dont you think it sort of started with the fans leaving? Anyhow, if youre so dedicated that you make shitty marker pen signs at home, why leave before the end? Never understood that behavior. Stay till the jobs done.||1
To the best of my memory, the fans were starting to make their exits around the 3 minute mark or so. Offense had gone into a full collapse by that point, and Kyrie was going bonkers.\n\nFans are allowed to make a statement too. Call it bulletin board material if you want. |Celtics|1
Are you joking? It 'started' with the fans leaving? The fans dont make the warriors miss 6mins worth of shots, they started playing like ass. The crowd reacts to the play on the court, and is capable of inspiring hustle and energy, but they dont make shots go in.||1
but game fluctuates, it's suppose to go up and down. giving them three minutes of cheer in the end could have made things a lot different, make no mistake. if they can't stick with them for 6min, I wonder what will happen in the coming seasons. ||1
How long have you watched basketball for? Honest question. Cause Ive honestly seen what happened last night with the crowd happen time and time again. Its hard to cheer loud when your team is being outplayed, outworked. And thats what was happening late in the 4th quarter. They were loud all night until it became clear their team didnt have what it took, imo.||2
used to watch more 2007/08 I was watching the classic lebron religiously, but since have sticked to only watching some of the play offs. And hence my frustration with the fans. I\'ve seen some shitty fans (Miami anyone?) In place where everyone acts all hollywood and stuff, but thats besides the point. The point is, "its hard" is not an explanation for anything. The players don\'t make that excuse, because it\'s supposed to be hard. And the greatest fans in the NBA (I really liked Indiana series last year for that reason) stick with the team, it may be hard to cheer, but that doesn\'t warrant an exodus with 3 minutes left on the clock. I realize they were expecting a championship and were let down, that\'s gotta suck. I think most arenas would behave differently. Even Kobe era Laker fans would have sucked it up I bet in a situation like this, hoping that Mamba turns shit around. That\'s what players like that do. Sorry to hear Curry doesn\'t have the proper stuff for such feats. (Well maybe he does, let\'s see tonight).  ||1
> The players dont make that excuse\n\nThats because the players are getting paid millions of dollars, they dont get to make excuses, whereas the fans are paying outrageous prices to watch. Theres no comparison between players and fans. \n\nAlso if you've ever been to a game yourself, you'd know that when the team goes into a lull, and the rest of the crowd starts getting quiet, it becomes hard even for a passionate fan to be loud. With 3 minutes left they would have had to have put on possibly the best comeback in NBA history. Hard to get too excited about the likelihood of that happening.\n\nIdeally fans would be loud all game, giving their team the best chance to win, but its just not practical, even in the NBA finals. Fans are just people after all.||1
Coach Kerr had better not thrown in the towel because some fans left early. If, somehow against still quite large odds against, Cleveland comes back to win this thing, he needs to answer for not -- oh I don't know -- actually trying to win this game. Foul, extend the game, scrape and claw. It was not a blowout, and while GSW shooters had been cold you gotta give them a chance to rain 3's and take home a trophy, don't you?||3
thats exactly what anyone would assume you do when your down 11-15 points, but oh well since no one gives a shit, lets just go home. thats what it looked like and its despicable. fans making a statement? you have to have an opinion to make a statement, most these assholes probably there for a facebook photo in a yellow t shirt. nba games live are mind boggling to me, all this effort to keep ppl engaged, one of the most dynamic dysciplins out there and ppl still get bored. No wonder soccer isnt big in the US, but man are soccer games 50 million times better live. NBA is better on tv than soccer tho. ||3
It can\'t be a "we didn\'t want to insult the game with that kind of strategy" thing, because he had his team intentionally fouling Tristan Thompson off the ball in the backcourt earlier in the game. It was a lay down, roll over, and take it ending that was simply mystifying in a title game. It would be borderline weird to watch that kind of acceptance of defeat in a meaningless regular season game. I just don\'t get it: Curry and Klay are young but not so young that they\'d have their spirits broken so easily in a big game like this. They\'ve already had those games in their careers and come out legit MVP candidates on the other wide. There was simply no fight in the Warriors in the last 3 minutes of the game. None. Inexplicable and inexcusable, and it starts at the top.||2
my guess is they saw that lebron and kyrie went bonkers on them and it may have been intimidating. not sure if it means they should tuck their dicks back like they did, but hey, the big duo really did some numbers on them. game 6 is gonna be big||2
Steph 3/13 in the second half? Bitch made IMO.|Knicks|6
NBA got what it wanted. |Lakers|5
Looks like the Warriors can win without Steph but not without Green. Draymond is the real engine of the Warriors.||7
Especially when he powers up the nut thrusters|Cavaliers|1
That certainly wasn\'t true in the OKC series, where Green was a net negative for most of the series, often looked bad vs Adams, and it was only the shooting of Steph and Klay that rescued the team and won them the final 3 games.\n\nYes, against a softish, undersized team like the Cavs Green is very important. He\'s the guy who benefits the most from the extreme attention Klay and Steph get, and on the Cavs, there\'s not enough toughness, athleticism, and size to still give him a tough time while focusing mainly on the Splash Bros. \n\nDifferent teams make different players valuable. Iggy is very valuable in a series where he\'s guarding Durant or Lebron, not as valuable against the Spurs. Kevin Love has less value than Richard Jefferson in this series. Love is getting exposed a bit, but he\'s not actually worse than Richard Jefferson.\n\nJust because this is a series where Green has maybe the most lopsided match up of any Warrior, combined with the fact that the Cavs aren\'t exactly gameplanning to stop him first (or even second), doesn\'t mean that he\'s actually been the key to the team all year. \n\nNow granted, it may be that there is no absolute "Key to the team" with the dubs, and they\'re more a TEAM in the classic Spurs sense. But that the Warriors don\'t fall apart when one player isn\'t on the court shouldnt be an indictment of Steph Curry as a fake superstar or something. The Bulls were still good\xe2\x80\x94and the triangle didn\'t fall apart\xe2\x80\x94when Jordan left to play Baseball. That teams like the LeBron Cavs or the Nash Suns fell apart when one guy went to the bench (let alone got hurt) is more an indictment of how poorly they were put together/coached. If your team becomes garbage the moment you lose one player, you don\'t have much of a system. You have "give the ball to x" and get out of the way. \n\nOrlando TMac isn\'t better than Tim Duncan because he was more obviously MVP of his team. He\'s probably actually more *valuable* because unlike Duncan, Tmac\'s Orlando has no idea how to get buckets the moment he goes to the bench. But that doesn\'t mean he\'s actually better.||4
I totally agree with a lot of what you said except I'm curious why you say green is less valuable against the spurs. He played pretty good defense against lma despite his size.|NBA|1
I was talking about Iguodala there. I was using Iggy\'s variable value (does he have an elite offensive wing to guard?) to illustrate that value fluctuates dependent on matchups (which is obvious i guess). But then taking that and saying that on great teams, that\'s even true of superstars, because the system should ideally empower strong complementary players to contribute too.\n\nGreen is a key to the team, no doubt. Curry is still the guy the Cavs are up all night gameplanning for. The problem of "how do we stop steph curry?" informs everything about the Warriors, including the way they use Green. I just don\'t understand why a versatile, multifaceted offense is considered an indictment of the "star" player. \n\nedit: Of course, if Curry plays bad the next two games and they lose, he deserves blame. But he then deserves blame for playing bad, not for being on a team that doesn\'t fall apart when he goes to the bench.||1
Yup I stand corrected. I reread your original post. \n\nAgain I also agree with what you just posted. |NBA|1
Kyrie Irving has a more complete offensive game than Steph Curry. He's also 4 years younger. He could be scary(ier?) in a couple years. |Cavaliers|12
2spuki4mi|Cavaliers|3
Congrats NBA, you got exactly what you wanted. \n\nEDIT: Lol I'm not mad the Cavs won, and Kyrie and LeBron obviously went off. However the way the NBA has handled the playoffs and these decisions is clearly flawed. They clearly saw this game as expendable because the Warriors were up 3-1, now it's 3-2 and Bogut has a torn knee most likely. I just wish they would have suspended Draymond when he deserved it and not when it was the easiest.\n\nEDIT 2: I'm not sure if I'm not being clear or what, but I don't care who won the game. I'm upset at the NBA making decisions based on more than the play itself. It's hard not to think that OKC and their fans got fucked over because the NBA felt the game mattered too much for Draymond to miss, yet this one didn't and ultimately furthered their interested by extending the series. |Lakers|179

At least it was fun, not like Kyrie and Bron didn't absolutely dominate|Pistons|2
I mean, can't be too upset with another finals game though.|Lakers|5
hahaha look at these warriors fans downvoting everyone, even a neutral comment like this one. pathetic|Nuggets|8
Ya! FUCK YOU NBA. You let LeBron and Kyrie combine for 80+! Oh, and you make Curry played like horse shit to|Raptors|6
Not their fault Curry fucking sucked (to his standards)|[LAL] Kobe Bryant|8
Klay had to carry the Warriors again||12
Green is a grown ass man and should take responsibility for his own actions. \n\nHe's a dirty player and should have been suspended earlier for all his dirty plays in the past few weeks|Pacers|8
Even if they did suspend wouldn't the points have added up to another suspension for this game anyway? |Cavaliers|3
It's Draymond fault for even being in that position||278
Here we go again...|Spurs|1
I agree. I also believe it's bullshit that he wasn't suspended in the OKC series. I also think the NBA would not have touched that ball tap if the Cavs had won Game 4.\n\nI really hate that the issue has become a bitch-fest between Bron and Dray. The real issue is the inconsistency from the league office.|Cavaliers|1
The NBA should have suspended him when he deserved it, not when it was easiest.|Lakers|166
[deleted]||1
Dude you can't be serious, are people on here really this dumb? |Lakers|1
Think he makes an interesting point actually.. if they suspend Draymond in that series, as he should have been, it changes the entire course of events, butterfly effect n whatnot.. We'll never know though||1
Yes, which is apart of my argument......|Lakers|1
Actually you didnt say anything of the kind, whether you intended to or not I dont know. You said "The NBA should have suspended him when he deserved it, not when it was easiest." .. Which part of that is relating to what he said? But whatever, just responding cause I have nothing better to do, totally pointless debate.||1
My original post|Lakers|1
Wasn\'t the only reason he was suspended because he finally hit that four-flagrants threshold that triggers suspension? \n\nI\'m not so sure Adam Silver and his henchmen were sitting around a table rubbing their hands together saying, "Ah yes, we suspend him tomorrow because of convenience!"|Knicks|1
When it was easiest? Listen, I'm all in that Dray should have been suspended for the Adams incident. But the NBA was just following protocol with this one. He picked up a fair flagrant and because of culmination, he was suspended. \n\nWhat Dray needs to do is stop putting himself in those positions. |Kings|1
He would have been suspended regardless if they gave him the boot on the OKC series. Every flagrant is a suspension now, why are we blaming the NBA when Dray put himself in that position? |Magic|1
It was an accumulation not the one event. God people. |76ers|1
If they did warriors probably wouldn't even make it to the finals|Rockets|1
To me that's just karmic justice. The league giveth and the league extendith to at least 6 games.|Cavaliers|1
Tell that to OKC |Lakers|1
So what, like every game then?|Cavaliers|1
Game 6 for tripping Kanter in game 5?|[SAS] Boris Diaw|1
When Dahntay got suspended and Dray didn't for the first kick, they clearly indicated that reputation/intent matter. When Dray didn't have rep of 3 nut shots, it might seem like it wasn't intentional. But as it happened again and again, NBA decided his rep indicates intent and gave him the final flagrant. It's not a conspiracy lol|Timberwolves|2
Except there is a legit argument that he didn't even hit him in the balls or try.|Lakers|-1
That's fair. I was arguing under the assumption that he did hit him. Could go either way, but it definitely looked like it to me|Timberwolves|1
You could take that position but he still responded to LeBron with a cheap shot. That's still unnecessary contact and a deserved flagrant foul.||2
He did NOT get suspended for his flagrant on LeBron. He got suspended for the ACCUMULATION of flagrants over the course of the playoffs. |[MIA] Dwyane Wade|4
Sure, but they gave him a flagrant for a call that easily didn't have to be called a flagrant because they knew it would lead to a suspension. |Lakers|-1
Dray made a swipe at LeBrons groin area which is NOT okay and he was given a lesser punishment than what he got for punting Steven Adams balls (flagrant 1 opposed to a flagrant 2)|[MIA] Dwyane Wade|4
I mean, culmination he did deserve it, it was just late and at a most conspicuous time|Pistons|134
Yeah but the suspension should have came at the time he deserved it, not when it was easier on them. |Suns|0
Sure, but they said they gave him one last warning, if thats true, then the suspension is warranted now, I'm sure they wanted to try to keep players in as much as they can.|Pistons|4
If he got suspended earlier, then did the Bron flagrant still in game 4, it would've been more games now, right?|Knicks|2
Probably up to the NBA's discretion, not sure how they'd rule it|Pistons|2
he should've got suspended after the Adams kick is what OP's saying|Warriors|2
I agree, but I think the NBA tries to keep key players in for key games, and that's why they gave him a final warning. At least, that is how it'd look if they aren't rigging it.|Pistons|1
Or the Adams throw or the Durant face kick or whatever.|Raptors|4
He would have just been suspended again lol|[LAL] Kobe Bryant|106
[deleted]||-1
Technical fouls are a separate count from the Flagrant fouls count.\n\nIf he had committed the flagrant he did against LeBron, he still gets the automatic suspension for the flagrant foul points adding up.|[LAL] Kobe Bryant|3
Or OKC could have been in the finals, I think that's where more of the salt comes from |Raptors|19
I mean Draymond played and we still lost|Warriors|2
Yea oops, Draymond was actually pretty bad in Game 3/4|Raptors|2
After tripping kanter he played and you won|Suns|3
wtf are u talking about? They won that game anyways (the game when green was suppose to be suspended)||2
Yea I realized mb, but I still think the salt carrying over from that series is true|Raptors|1
They fucking choked and it's entirely their own fault.|[LAL] Kobe Bryant|14
> The NBA should have suspended him when he deserved it\n\nif they'd suspended him when he deserved, the warriors might not have even made it to the finals|Rockets|84
If they'd suspended him when he deserved it, he also would've been suspended again tonight, assuming they'd still be here.|Cavaliers|0
Doubt it. |Celtics|1
That's the fucking problem|[BOS] Marcus Smart|1
Damn, I hadn't even thought of this|[CLE] LeBron James|1
Which would have been a deserved outcome.|Lakers|15
Nah, he would've been suspended for Game 4 in the WCF, which the Warriors got blown out in anyway. |Warriors|7
well y'all got blown out tonight so I guess it didn't matter|Rockets|1

That was lame. Not necessarily the usual crowd tho.|Warriors|1
Kyrie was fucking incredible. So much respect for him this series. Goes without saying that the King is the King. \n\nLooking forward to Draymond getting a redemption game on the road.|Warriors|3
I'm pulling for the cavs in this one, but as an MSU fan I look forward to a pissed off draymond|NBA|1
LOL @ at Dubs "fans" leaving with 3:30 left in the 4th. Shameful.||3
Someone check on ayeshas stupid ass, see if she's still talking shit ||3
The NBA should seriously look in to suspending flopping...it's just getting really bad.\nAll they need to do is review flops and suspend the OBVIOUS flops...that way it will make players think twice about flopping .|Celtics|3
What a performance from Kyrie! I'm not even mad, I'm impressed. |Warriors|3
God, its so frustrating being on the other side of Varejao's antics|[CLE] Kyrie Irving|3
omg, did draymond green just piss off lebron james? are we going to get the game 6 boston lebron for the rest of the series? \n\nyou fuck up draymond...|Raptors|3

LeBron had one of those "fuck you" games. I don\'t think anyone can take over a game and produce a stat line like that.|Cavaliers|3
Boy, can wait to hear Klay Thompson's father's opinion on tonight's game |Hawks|3
All I'm wondering is why everyone is already acting like it's a foregone conclusion that there will be a game 7. Warriors already won in Cleveland once, the way people are talking the Warriors might as well just forfeit the next game. This sub might even be more ridiculous that r/nfl..and that's just...wow.||3
I hope we get to see pissed off, on fire Draymond. He's probably a much more important part of GSW's heart and soul and I kinda wanna watch him go off on Cleveland.|Bucks|-2

Can't wait for all the salt if the LeBron and the Cavs win it all.||3
I feel like I'm way late to this hate train ... but why the fuck are the NBA being blamed for Draymond's suspension? I thought it was as a result of accumulated technicals?|Suns|3
Accumulation of flagrants.\n\nI think it is the narrative that Draymond did something minuscule to warrant the flagrant. But the real problem is Draymond's temper. How does he have such poor self-control and self-awareness not to realize how much his actions can hurt his team? There was no reason for him to acquire flagrants in the past series.  |Spurs|1
I think it's because the league should have suspended Green when he kicked Adam's balls in the first place. They crumbled under pressure and couldn't get it right when it was a tough decision. Game 4 was a much easier decision because of the accumulation of techs so there you have it. \n\nEdit: flagrants||1
Glad i got to see SSJ Irving one last time||3
Curry is known for taking those crazy shots and landing them! But fuuuuuck 8 from 21. \n\nWhen he gets them........ WHAT A GOD........ When he misses those type of shots........ WTF WAS THAT. |Warriors|3

Hell of a performance from LBJ and Kyrie|Heat|3
That's that 2012 game 6 in Boston facing elimination LeBron |[CHI] Luol Deng|3
Through 40 minutes of playing  Kevin Love had 2 points and 3 redounds\n\n\nSIT. KEVIN. LOVE. \n\n\nwtf are you afraid of, coach Lue?\n\n\n|76ers|3
This is the perfect time for Kevin Love to deliver a 50/25 in Game 7 on 25/25 shooting.|Heat|2
KEVIN LOVE was +18?!?!?!?!!? Is that indicative of his defense or merely a product of Draymond Green not being able to punish him offensively and defensively??   |Cavaliers|3
It's indicative of being on the floor when LeBron and Kyrie were roasting the Warriors|Heat|5
Big Three of Cleveland scored 84 points of the team's 112 points. Amazing.|Celtics|3
interesting stat I just saw: Warriors were 0 for 8 on UNCONTESTED Field Goals in the 4th quarter. UNCONTESTED!\n\n'also, the only point (yes, singular) scored in the final 6:30 of the game for the Warriors was off an Anderson Varejao free throw|Lakers|3
KLove, 2 points.  I never liked this trade.  |Cavaliers|3
He doesn't match up well against the Warriors and he has had good stretches In games this series. People forget what a monster he was all playoffs. |Cavaliers|1
Well he has a concussion so hes not gonna play like a god. |Rockets|1
Good shit, hopefully the Cavs force a game 7. ||3
I feel like the Warriors bricked every shot for the last 10 minutes of the 4th. |Rockets|3
#FUCK BARNES|Warriors|3
Lakers will gladly accept your garbage. |Lakers|3
I'm gonna speak briefly about the refs on a known flopper.||3
So annoying that once again Lebron has to personally will his team back into the fight.  Kyrie came up big, but James has been doing this for a long time.  He's just so good.||3
Interesting to see what will happen when Green returns. Only Lebron and Kyrie scored in double digits. That cannot be good at all. Draymond will make it difficult for Cleveland in the next game and their supporting cast needs to step up .||3
No love for JR's ten?|[POR] Arvydas Sabonis|1
It isnt nearly enough from him though is it?||1
Hm, arguable. It is a double-digit number, I'm certain.|[POR] Arvydas Sabonis|1
wow. Harrison barnes with just 5 points in 37 mins and Kevin love only 2. These two guys are overrated. |[GSW] Klay Thompson|3
I bet Draymond gets baited into a flagrant on Delly in Game 6 (for automatic Game 7 suspension) and he's going to go so ape-shit crazy he punches a ref in the the mouf like Kermit Washington did to Rudy Tomjanovich and kills a man on national TV. That's my prediction.|Heat|9

Their needs to be an organized and concerted effort to taunt Green at the Q. Everything short of racial slurs need to be hurled at him. He's a garbage person and it's gamesmanship at its finest.|Pistons|6
Get ready for the high and mighty "this subreddit is the worst," "n/NBA is just so cringe for me during the Finals," "I hate how everyone is so reactionary."\n\nGET OVER YOURSELF. This is fun! What a storyline, Lebron just putting the hammer down after all that bs the past few days. But now you know the Warriors and Draymond will be PISSED game 6. Lighten up, this is great!\n||5

So since when was swinging at a guys crotch because they disrespected you considered manly? Like I legit am laughing that people are defending a man for trying to smack another mans crotch... Only in sports xD|Lakers|7
It's Lebron, that's why. |[CLE] LeBron James|5
I don't want to hear this Lebron chokes shit anymore. This man played his fucking heart out!\n\n|Cavaliers Bandwagon|10
He was ass in the 4th quarter. I was hoping the Warriors would come back.|Knicks|-3
41/16/7/3/3, and the best defensive player for either team. Only 2 turnovers. Lead either team in *every* major stat. And how many shots did he alter without getting the block? If LeBron was a little tired in the 4th, he earned that shit.  That's probably one of the top 10 finals games of the last decade. \n\nSaying he was ass is ridiculous haterism. Kobe was my favorite player growing up, but I don't know that he ever put up a better finals stat line, or was as dominant on both ends in one finals game.\n||3
4th quarter is what I focused on.|Knicks|-1
Without Draymond the warriors are shit a defense.|Lakers|2
If James Harden were to play defense like Curry is right now, then the front page would be trashing his ass all day.|Mavericks|8
His defense was fine. The offense by Kyrie and LeBron was much better. There weren't a lot of open looks. The Warriors were in their face all night and the shots simply fell. |Magic|-1
no. Curry played terrible d all night. klay was the one who played great but was beat by better offense. he never gave an inch but the shots just kept falling.|Celtics|1
Or shoot 8-21 or whatever he did|Rockets|3
Kyrie grew up today and LBJ answered his critics. Thank god.|Rockets|6
Their hug after the game. Damn. Them against the world.||1
Way too many blatantly missed/forced calls by the refs for me to take this game seriously. ||4
then just stop watching and commenting please|Cavaliers|0
41-16-7-3-3\n\nWow. |Trail Blazers|7
It took superhuman efforts from Kyrie and LeBron and nobody on the Warriors but Klay showing up (Draymond literally) to win this game and it was close until mid-4th. Cleveland fans should have their buttcheeks fully clenched in Game 6.|Lakers|7
They just won by double digits in one of the hardest places to win this season. That is still impressive and imo they have some momentum again. Lebron finally remembered that he has to carry this team an put up 40. Kyrie will put up at least 20 or 30. |Lakers|0
Momentum isn't a thing that carries game to game|Lakers|1
That was in Oakland though. I'll take absolutely any win I can get on the road. Different ball game on your home floor.|Thunder|1
FUCK ADAM SILVER|Nets|8
Let's allow it for this game :)|Cavaliers|1
Ayesha Curry just tweeted "It\'s amazing how quick you all are to call me out of my name and wish pain on my family and I\'ve never used one obscenity or foul word back." \n\nNow I agree that the people who wish harm on her family and call her names need to get a life but isn\'t this almost the exact same thing LeBron said? The reporter asked him what he thought about Klay saying he got his feelings hurt and LeBron said it\'s tough to always take the high road.\n\nMrs. Curry then tweets, "High Road. invisible bridge used to step over said person when open floor is available left to right." \n\nMind you this had nothing to do with what Klay said. I think that\'s was pretty damn hypocritical to be honest. |Cavaliers|10
Reminds me of Eminen . . .\n\n"Will Smith don\'t gotta cuss in his rap to sell record -- well I do, so fuck him and fuck you too!"||-3
Except Eminem is completely self-aware whereas Ayesha has no self-awareness whatsoever|Bulls|5
Didnt say they were like each other . . .||1
Very hypocritical ||1
Bit too much action going on over Twitter I think. Just play the damn game. Goes for "non players" (eg. Ayesha) as well for sure|Warriors|1
So the hypocrite called out the other hypocrite. |Knicks|1
Yeah honestly, Ayesha sucks.|Bulls|1
I think there's a difference between klay implying lebron is soft or Ayesha Curry calling him out and death threats. But then again Ayesha Curry should stay out of this|Knicks|2

Why? I don't get this logic. They have jobs and lives. They need to stay and cheer bums playing garbage time? For what purpose? |Bulls|1
And with that logic you're saying the players that only get to play an average 2 mins at the very end are practically useless and no one wants to see them play. They're still part of the team aren't they |Hawks|0
Yes, they are part of the team, and they are getting paid millions of dollars to sit on a bench and cheerlead.\n\nI think they can handle playing glorified pickup for 3 minutes in a half empty gym. |Bulls|1

- The lack of a big man for the Warriors tonight was the biggest reason why lebron and Irving went off tonight.

I'm really confused on how +/- works, how on earth did kevin love have a higher +/- then lebron?!|Celtics|2
It is basically how the score went while your on the floor, so if your on the floor and your team scores it goes up by the score, if the opponent scores while your playing it goes down.|[LAL] Kobe Bryant|1
Watch, Game 6, Draymond kicks Lebron in the balls, flagrant 2, gets ejected and suspended for Game 7. |Timberwolves|2

How's Kyrie's must maligned defense looking this series? I haven't watched many games this finals.|Raptors|1
Honestly didn't pay much attention to that, especially since i watch on a blurry online stream where it's hard to be able to instantly distinguish players instantly. The warriors did miss a lot of open shots though, regardless of the defense.|Warriors|1
cmon, lebron is leading both teams in points, rebounds, assists, steals, and minutes. |Pelicans|3
so thats how much draymond is missed..kyrie and bron bron shooting the lights out|Lakers|2
I think Festus is gonna blow up next game and earn a higher price as an FA|Rockets|2
Oh shit, I forgot about that. How serious is Bogut's injury?  The tone seemed to change with him out|Timberwolves|2
Colbert is roasting the Warriors and Curry's shoes on the late show right now |Mavericks|2
Good game Cavs. No offense though, I hope this is the last victory that you get to celebrate. |Wizards|2
Honestly feel like Draymond's energy on both ends of the court, is harder to play without than what Steph or Klay brings. Especially when you consider the other bigs the Warriors have. Nobody to fill his spot tonight. |Celtics|2
SIT. KEVIN. LOVE. |76ers|2
Kyrie and LeBron were incredible.|[SAS] Tim Duncan|2
This loss is directly on Draymond Green's affinity to balls.||2
Really dissapointed in Curry's play. You would expect full effort from him on a close out game at home but he was really bad,missing wide open shots left and right.||2
With bogut down is curry 50% now? |Cavaliers|2
TRADE KEVIN LOVE|Knicks|2
But... he's a 'bitch,' right?|Cavaliers|2
Maybe Kevin should dress up like Wes for game 6||2
A few notes:\n\n1. Kyrie Irving put on a clinic. He made extremely difficult shots over and over again. He made extremely hard shots that we criticised him for in the earlier games. The difference is today he was just on a roll. If I am GSW, I do not worry as they guarded him fairly well and when Draymond comes back it will be more difficult to shoot around the rim. You can bet he will cool down a bit and shoot the Cavs out of some possessions similar to game 4.\n\n2. Lebron played very smart. Attacked the basket when he felt he could take advantage of lacklustre rotations or a when weak defender switches onto him (i.e. Speights). His jumpshot fell with ease and he looked confident. Again if I am GSW, I worry a bit that his shot is falling but I live with that but those free runs to the basket, easy layups due to poor switching will go away with Draymond back in for game 6.\n\n3. Ty Lue is going to have trouble again in game 6 as his bench continues to provide zero production outside of Richard Jefferson.\n\n4. Everytime Tristan Thompson switches onto Curry he doesn't try and shake him and shoot but looks to get it in the paint to abuse the smaller matchup (usually Kyrie mismatched against someone). I worry something is up because he was doing this earlier in the series with lateral crossovers. Steph looks disinterested out there.\n\n5. I expect Ezeli to start game 6 if Bogut can not go. With Iggy back to the bench.|Raptors|2

I don't see him crying in press conferences about being called a name.||0
Draymond's a scumbag. He was just describing that piece of garbage. I didn't see much crying|Cavaliers|1
No worries brother, a lot of people were writing off the Cavs tonight and they clearly were wrong. Game 6 is going to be difficult for GSW, Cavs have it in them to take it to 7. They need another game like game 4 (minus the 4th quarter).|Raptors|2
Thanks Man, Well, i try not to partake but between how the last game got out of hand, the "Lebron is bitch" brigades, the draymond (scumbag) defenders, and all media nonsense, everywhere I looked for finals news Lebron was being crapped on. All the trash talking was really starting to piss me off this week! LOL. We can do this! Cavs in 7. |Cavaliers|1
I just read through this again, Cavs in 7!! Glad you kept the hope brother!\n\nI was rooting for the Warriors to complete that record season but they came up short! I gained new respect for Kyrie Irving.\n\nHow awesome was game 7 though? That 3~ minute stretch of back and forth basketball in the 4th where no one could score was amazing. I was watching it with my friends and we were just standing the entire time (some Cavs fans, some Warriors fans). Both sides were waiting to exhale and I was thinking to myself holy crap this is the best game I\'ve ever seen. I knew near the end of the stretch whoever made the next shot would win it. And finally when Kyrie made that shot over Curry, I thought to myself in disbelief, "It\'s Over", holy crap, they did it, so many times this season the Warriors pulled wins from moments like this but not this time, not this time, it was the Cavs who prevailed.\n\nI think back and just feel it really was one shot that pretty much decided that game. Either team could have won it and I don\'t get too low on the Warriors for losing. Congratulations Cavaliers, enjoy this feeling brother! Hopefully one day I can as well.|Raptors|1
Hey Man! I\'m just seeing this! \n\nWOW! Game 7 was amazing!!! It was one for the ages! \n\nThe whole game I was pretty much still on the sofa though in total suspense. Hoping for the best, expecting the worst, but trying to stay cool. That last 5 min stretch was tough to sit through! It was too close and only a matter of time before someone on GS began to rain 3s to crush our dreams in the final minutes. Just like how they\'ve been crushed in the past. It didn\'t happen this time! When the clock hit 00:00 it may have taken about 30 seconds for it to actually register with me. We DID IT!!!\n\nKyrie was phenomenal the whole game. He was making some really great plays in the 2nd half. That and 1 circus layup had me fired up! Then finished off the game with "The Shot". Unbelievable! My personal favorite highlight was the block on Iggy! WOW!\n\nGS is a truly exceptional team and one to be feared. They\'re incredible. After 2015 I had an intense grudge against GS. A true hater! Now that is gone. \n\nThe whole finals was just amazing. Believeland is real. We believed. At 0-2 the pessimism was high in the city. I think we were just in shock by how good GS was. After game 3 we knew we could do it even as we went down 3-1. \n\nI\'ve been smiling ear to ear typing this. Thanks Brother! Have a great day!|Cavaliers|1
Are you ready for more basketball?  \nFML. ^I ^can't ^even ^feign ^excitement  \nGet well soon Bogut!|Warriors|2
I can't wait until Kevin Love returns. I swear they'll win a championship if he comes back next game.||2
I didn't realize how incredibly bad Barnes really was until I saw the numbers. 2-14, 1-6, 0-2...Good Lord that is horrendous times two.|Knicks|2
Trust me, Love was worse. WAYYYY worse. ||3
Re: Love not contributing... \n\nThere was a play near the end of the 2nd quarter where Love kind-of-sort-of made a solid defensive stop on Iggy. I think it was either a bad miss or a turnover.  \n\nSo, he at least has that going for him, which is nice. \n\nLiabilities and all, I'd be fine seeing Portland trade for Love this summer. Come back home to the LO, Kevin. |Trail Blazers|2
  M. \n K m lm|Warriors|2
Frye getting no play time at all. Yikes. Was his defense that much of a liability?|Cavaliers|2
Great win, but it just doesn't seem sustainable. All this iso-heavy offense with little or no movement off the ball won't yield 2 more wins for the Cavs, especially with Green coming back. |[CLE] LeBron James|2
how in the hell does someone go off for 37 points yet still finish with a -21?|Raptors|2
Bc it's a crappy stat|Charlotte Hornets|2
Seems like the Cav's solid offensive performance in this game is overshadowing how awful GS were offensively. So I'd be more interested in whether or not the Cavs can force GS to shoot that poorly in the next two games over how important Green is to GS. I doubt it, but at least the series has gotten a little more interesting. As a neutral, hopefully Cavs can win game 6 and we get a game 7 that comes down to the wire.\n\nAlso, I'm tied of the media saying Curry must be hurt. He's perfectly fine, he's just being made to work much harder than normal and it's affecting his game. It's not the first time he's struggled with the intensity of the playoffs. ||2
For real. Dubs fans complain about excuses from cavs fans all last postseason. And now they're one win away from another championship and they're the ones making excuses now. Sorry ass bunch of bandwagoners|Cavaliers|2
Honestly don't care who wins now, seems both teams are well-deserving despite underperforming stars (Love, Curry). \n\nStill waiting on a game where all the stars (Curry, Klay, Draymond, LeBron, Love, Kyrie) go off. |Knicks|2
How did love only get 2 pts?|Thunder|2
Hey guys I wasn't able to watch the game does anyone know where I can catch some highlights online? I'd love to just see all of Lebron's and Kyrie's field goals made if something like that exists.\n\nI apologize if this isn't the right place to ask|Spurs|2
Look up 'Ximo NBA highlights' on youtube|Cavaliers|2
thx!|Spurs|2
Lebron and Kyrie hit a lot of their jumpers and made Golden States pay for daring them to shoot but a big reason they did so well was because Golden States didn't have their bigs in Draymond Green and Bogut. Golden States didn't have most of their interior defense and were late on lot of their help defense, resulting in Lebron and Kyrie getting easy drives to the basket. I would've been more impressed if Lebron and Kyrie were able to play this well when Golden States is at 100%. If Bogut isn't able to come back and Cavs somehow wins the series, it'd be pretty messed up.|Spurs|2
How big was it not having Draymond in this game?  Although I will say that GS missed a shit ton of open or semi open 3 pointers, that shit can't happen.|Pistons|2
It's was  big because there was no rim protector. |Heat|1
Wow the Cave just made it interesting. I wouldn't be surprised now to see a game 7|Raptors|2
I don't think so,  Warriors are going to play angry. |Heat|0
Them playing angry is terrifying. |Cavaliers|0
Yeah, that is why I think they are going to win game 6.|Heat|0
If GS had scored 10 more points this game would be up there as one of best in finals history. These games are just so boring in the last 4 min. The last 5 min of the second quarter when clay kept hitting 3's and kyrie/lebron kept plowing through 3 guys to get lay ups was incredible.|Raptors|2
It would be nice to have a close game one of these days|Rockets|2
because of all this Kevin Love hate, the price of his jersey has dropped.  so let the hate flow through you...but direct it towards Westbrook next|Trail Blazers|2
I don't get to watch many warriors games but is Steph always this careless on passes?  He lobbed a pass to Klay at half court that was easily intercepted by Kyrie.  Hell i could of even intercepted that considering the distance and speed.\n\nThen he had an entry pass to Iggy that went directly to the defender.  ||2
If Steph isn't shooting well, it affects his ball-handling, playmaking, and general temperament. It frustrates me to no end. He still has improvements to make as a leader.||2
Some days you get the bitch, some days the bitch gets you. |Warriors|12

Sometimes I feel like Lebron is One Punch Man. Most days he doesn't want to handle the pressure or seem like a bad guy so he defers to the role players. But then some days him and Genos just say fuck it and kill all the bad guys while still looking bored as fuck.|Lakers|2

Damn, I need to watch that anime|[MIA] Hassan Whiteside|0
I love how all the circle jerking on this sub completely ignores the fact draymond didn't play.   It's like watching a group of golfers shave strokes.  A win is a win, even against a crippled opponent.  ||3
Real talk, you fucks have made this sub insufferable the last two days. You all act like LeBron is soft because he doesn\'t like to get called a bitch, while simultaneously standing up for a recidivist dick swatter. Posting and upvoting all these people with there cute little tweets/soundbites about how he is soft. Check this guys stats the last 2 finals and tell me how he doesn\'t show up in big games. He arguably should have been the Finals MVP last year, and has heavily outplayed the MVP in both finals.\n\n\nDraymond Green reacted that way because he got disrespected. But he is too fucking stupid (or emotional) to realize that he is the only player on the court that can\'t fucking retaliate given his history throughout this playoff run. He had to stick up for himself as a "man" by swatting at a penis, again, and his suspension cost his team dearly. He deserves it. \n\nDraymond, you are nothing but a poor man\'s LeBron James. Even though Lebron has played in like 10 more NBA seasons than you, he is still, at this moment, better at every single facet of basketball than you are or will ever be. And he has the  ability to not play like an emotional moron every time he gets a little upset.\n\nIf not playing emotional and not liking to be called bitch makes one a bitch, well sign me up for bitch camp. |Heat Bandwagon|8

and i repeat, Calderon for Klove, you get a savy vet in change for a scrub|Knicks|3
What a fucking game, so entertaining. Lebron showed once again why he's the best player in the game, what a truly dominant performance. I said in the last post game thread that it looked like he had changed up his form to a smoother release with less fade and that turned out to be correct. Lebron does not lose game 6s, this is going 7. GG. |Raptors|3
To be quite frank, we are better without Love. Regardless of the result of this final, we need to trade him.|[CLE] Zydrunas Ilgauskas|3
RJ scored 8 in 11 minutes, Love scored two in 35 minutes... also seems like jefferson has way more intensity and defensive prowess|Pelicans|0
This sounds crazy but what if Love is traded for Bosh on condition that Cavs doctors will clear Bosh per his wishes to play despite health risks. Bosh would take the third banana role again (more willingly) and comes off the bench for the Cavs as a primarily 3 point and spot-up shooter. Like a super Frye.\n\nLove takes a clearer second banana role behind Wade and gets to play with a legit center like he did in Minnesota which opens him up for easy rebounds and putbacks and probably returns to being a legit 25/15 guy in Miami.|Heat|0
Really not looking to pick up Bosh. Second year in a row hes had blood clots, he might not even play basketball ever again. Clear red flag, definitely would not want to pick him up, besides pretty sure hes none to happy about Lebron leaving Miami.|[CLE] Zydrunas Ilgauskas|1
Doesn't matter, Cavs need someone better than Love. Nobody else is going to take Love (at least not without a severe catch like Bosh's blood clots). The catch here is maybe you bring Bosh on after the All-Star break and he can give a solid March - June along with his playoff experience and experience playing with leBron - maybe push the Cavs over the top. They only need him for 1 season, and Bosh seems to need to play basketball.|Heat|1
Thats a terrible trade and I cant believe youre basically saying lets throwout love so we can maybe have Bosh for 3 months|[CLE] Zydrunas Ilgauskas|1
All LeBron needs is someone who can actually make a shot during May and June.|Heat|1
Kyrie shot 70% in this game. Hot damn.|Cavaliers|2
Are we really not going to talk about how Curry managed to get 3/13 in the second half? I need lowlights.|Cavaliers|3
The Cleveland Isos stay alive. Who needs passing when Kyrie/LeBron played Carmelo ball so well!\n\nJust chuck and pray!||4
Wow Harrison Barnes.\nHe literally didnt do anything. He was fucking useless|Raptors|3
He scored more than Love ;\\|Heat|0
But he wasted more possessions than Love. |Warriors|0
He had more rebounds and less turnovers than Love. lol|Heat|1
I don't feel like doing the math right now, but I feel like Barnes was a lot more involved than Love in the offense, and managed to make a few more shots. I think it counters the rebound (especially given the low shooting %) and turnovers easily. |Warriors|1
Both played sub-par. They have to do better.|Heat|1
he played terrible... open shots|Spurs|1
He proved today why he's out there earning millions..||3
Why do people think draymond calling lebron a bitch means lebron isn't good? |76ers|3
 No one thinks "lebron isn\'t good". But many feel like he just "went and told mommy"..."waahhhh, someone called me a name, waaaaahhhhh".  Can you imagine Kobe or MJ in the same scenario? Of course those guys have a lion\'s heart. Lbj? He can\'t understand why someone else doesn\'t view him as the god he keeps insisting he is. Look at me, your god, I\'ve taken the high road for 13 years"  WTF?  Deserting your home town/team in the most disrespectful way possible on national tv is taking the high road? King douche everyone. ||-4
So LeBron haters want it both ways? You want to be able to call him a bitch no matter how well he plays? Fantastic. |Cavaliers Bandwagon|1
Being the best player in the World doesn't necessarily mean he isn't a bitch. |Knicks|1
So the haters get to chat shit no matter what. Seems like a betrayal of sports tradition. |Cavaliers Bandwagon|1
Doesn't matter. Being a bitch don't mean he ain't bad ass motherfucker. |Knicks|1
What? That's what I mean, him being called a bitch has nothing to do with his ability. |76ers|1
That's not how it works. If you call someone a bitch and they drop 40 on you the next day, you'll have a hard time finding anyone who will take the insult seriously. Unless you're the bitch who just hates for the sake of it. |Cavaliers Bandwagon|1
Bitch =\\= unskilled or talented. He meant he's a bitch because the whining and wanting his way all the time. Dropping 40 is a great response to the criticism. But the insult still has nothing to do with his ability. Please stop connecting the two. |76ers|1
No one actually thinks he's untalented|Cavaliers Bandwagon|1
I don't understand why it's okay to call LeBron a whiny bitch.  What about Steph Curry?  It's okay that he has his wife do his whining for him?|76ers|1
Because Lebron.  ||1

He averaged what 26/6/5 in the finals last year? He had over 25 tonight for sure and had a good game 2. LeBron and Kyrie had all time great performances tonight that doesn't mean Curry is having a bad series|Bulls|1
Lebron and Kyrie Andy Klay have elevated their play in the finals, Curry has done the opposite. Sure he's still playing well when compared to most everyone else, but that doesn't mean that he's doing what he *should* be doing. |Pistons|1
That's the story right now. People were saying Kyrie sucked and would get traded for Chris Paul if the Clippers would even do that. Curry has a good game 6 and the story will flip again.|Bulls|1
I think you're underestimating how consistently subpart curry has been all playoffs. Him going off in games 6 and 7 of the wcf still weren't enough for people to say he played great in that series|Pistons|1

Well, Cavs were done after Game 4 so I'll take our chances in a building where we've dominated in this post-season after a game we were supposed to have lost tonight.|Cavaliers|1
Would have been done with Green in the lineup, but I expected Cavs to win with him out.  Bogut getting hurt sealed the deal.||0
Those excuses are just as irrelevant as they were when Cleveland lost to Golden State without Love and Irving last year. They still had Curry and Klay and they couldn't get it done. |Cavaliers|1
Curry and Thompson did enough.  Their bench didn't show up.\n\nLove and Irving clearly haven't made that much a difference.  They would have lost with a worse record had the suspension not happened *with* Love and Irving.  ||1
> Irving clearly haven't made that much a difference\n\nI mean... you're aware of Kyrie's numbers from the last 3 games right? Let alone last night...\n\nLove I'll agree with, but Irving??? One of the best Finals performances of all time happened last night in-part because of Kyrie.|Cavaliers|1
A difference to the overall results.  He was persona non-grata in the first two games when they got blown out, and his great performance in game four was futile.  ||1
Ok then - two of the last three games have been won by the Cavs in large part because of Kyrie's play - is that a more acceptable claim to make? Because to say he's ineffective and unimportant (and I'm not suggesting you're actually making these claims) is plain silly based on the stats and the Cavs play with him on the floor. Hell - he helped an otherwise quiet K Love get a +18 last night all by himself.|Cavaliers|1

Stephen A Smith is just the worst. ||2
Since the NBA introduced the sleeved jerseys, LeBron has been trashing them;when all along, it was the piece missing that made him complete.|Supersonics|2
LeBron's offensive greatness and Kyrie's explosion shouldn't overshadow how well LBJ played defensively. Rebounded at a high level, defended the rim remarkably (3 blocks), played passing lanes (3 steals), and guarded Curry for stretches. His size, versatility, and athleticism have never been seen before|Timberwolves|2
And it's not just the defensive stats. He altered shots at the rim consistently. He was simultaneously their best wing defender and best rim protector. Anyone saying Irving was the real MVP tonight, he was probably a bit better offensively, but LeBron backed up his own historic offensive performance with the best defensive performance of the finals, maybe for either team. One of the best all-around games i've ever seen on this stage. Maybe the best?||1
Survive and continue Cleveland||2
That damn Igoudala behind the back fast break was the real turning point. Dumb passes not needed when they were like 6 points behind. ||2
Badass series. No matter who you cheer for. Good stuff. Lets take it to 7. ||2
Kevin Love still had a +/- of 18 on 2/3/1 with 4 fouls in 33 minutes. Meanwhile Klay drops 37 and goes -21 lmao|Thunder|2
Like all metrics in basketball and in other places, the whole story might not be told with a single number.|NBA|1
LeBron to the Warriors "I may be a grown ass man with 3 children. But today, I\'m your daddy... Bitch"|NBA|2
Kyrie could not miss, LeBron could not miss, Steph and Barnes couldn't hit anything. I'm honestly still feeling pretty good about our chances in game 6, unless those two go absolutely insane again.|Warriors|2
Do you think Curry is a choked? Dude has several wide open shots but couldn't hit. He shot pretty badly when he just needed to win a home game. If hes truly a superstar MVP he should be able to pull through. It was a close game and a good performance by Curry could've stole the show at home.|Rockets|1
Hint: he's overrated ||-1
I don't think back to back MVP/Finals appearances up 3-2 is overrated.|Warriors|1
Didn't say the team was overrated ||0
lol|Warriors|1
I don't think he choked, he's played in some pretty big games this season and done just fine. I think it was probably just a bad game, he's had a bit of a rough series here for whatever reason. I think they really missed Draymond's D last night and it showed.|Warriors|1
There is a very weird feeling inside me. I\'m not sure what it is. I think they call it "hope" or something like that. Correct me if I\'m wrong though |Cavaliers|2
Its called "defeat". I think its done, Game 6 Warriors are going to be angry. Green is going to be angry, I think he is going to drop a triple double. Even if the Cavs push it to game 7, Lebron is not going to show up.|Heat|1
You sound awfully sure of yourself. \n\nAgain, I HOPE we can keep pushing the momentum here. I HOPE we will win. But that doesn't mean I'm counting on it. Not sure why you make assumptions especially about LeBron considering he played ridiculously well |Cavaliers|1
Because after every big game he has a down game. |Heat|1
Hey man just wanted to check up and see how you were feeling? You know, since LeBron had a bunch of big games in a row and the Cavs won the championship. Just wondering if you regretted any of your irrational and unfounded assumptions. |Cavaliers|1
I have never anyone check on me from reddit.  Lol.  I am really happy that they won,  it was the greatest come back of all time.  |Heat|2
Seriously crazy. I just happened to be reading back through my comments and saw this thread lol. |Cavaliers|1
Yeah,  lebron finally got the "love" He deserves. |Heat|1
Think twice before you let your daddy talk trash for you to a future hall of famer like James. He Dad Dicked you for that one.|Hawks|2
uite a few Warrior\'s using Draymond as an excuse quickly followed by "But that\'s not an excuse" then why mention him at all if he aint\' the reason.|Cavaliers|2
There's a difference between an excuse and a reason. Obviously Draymond was part of the reason that the Warriors couldn't stop Kyrie and Lebron from making a barrage of inside shots throughout the game, but that shouldn't be an excuse - the Warriors still had the chance to win the game had they made more of those open shots in the 4th. ||1
That box score means fuck all to my mobile phone|Bulls|2
Clevelands Big 3 combining for 84 points was impressive as hell. On to Game 6!|Lakers|2
of those 84, Kevin Love scored 2 points. Turrible. |Clippers|2
I know, he has to show up next game if Cleveland wants to win. I don't expect warriors to be this bad next game. |Heat|1
There is something wrong with the stats, Curry had at least 2 straight steals that were not recorded.|Spurs|2
Green will come back and win it. Da Bulls.||2
Insane performances Kyrie, LeBron, and klay ||2

They hate 'cause he's an all time great |Cavaliers|2
I don't see them doing that with Green in the lineup Game 6. Not having him really fucked them over today. They had a shot to win but went dead cold in the second half.|Warriors|2
Good thing is that Irvings production in unsustainable for a whole series. Hopefully anyways|Warriors|2
What can I say? I love this LeBron. Locked in, focused, determined, and took control of the game, not caring about what's happening outside of the court. I expect to see a better LeBron and Kyrie in game 6 when they are at home. The Cavs bench have to step up though. edit: and Kevin Love.|NBA|1
You expect them to be better than dropping 41 each? They were historically good tonight.|Warriors|3
Scoring isn't the only way of getting better. In the second half, when they were up by double digit, they started taking a lot of contested shots rather than creating some space for themselves. Having watched the OKC-GSW series, it scares me thinking that the Warriors could have potentially came back from that.\n\nAs you said, they played great tonight, but I don't know if that's enough to face a GSW with Draymond and Bogut back. Not letting up (and/or settling for) during the last minutes (or last half) of the game is very important.|NBA|1
Fair enough. I'll just say I would expect more ball movement from them with Draymond back. You can't expect Kyrie to shoot 70% again.|Warriors|1
Double 50 next game. LeBron hasn't had a 50 note in such a long time, I think his last one was the 61 point game vs Charlotte years ago.|Heat|1
That would be a great treat, but I would prefer no heroball. If they can win without LBJ/Kyrie dropping 50, that'd be ideal. MJ only scored 63 in that Boston game because there was no one else he could count on, and he lost the game. Scoring that many points will also tire them out sooner, so..|NBA|1
Well, the NBA got what it wanted, now we're likely to have 7 games.||2
This is how one should respond to trash talk. Use it to fuel your game. I criticized Lebron for the way he reacted and taking himself out of the game on Friday, but damn if he didn't respond incredibly. \n\nGonna be interesting to see if this series can go to game 7. I don't see the Warriors dropping three in a row, but then again, how many people were saying the Warriors were done when they were down? ||2
He was able to respond because he baited Draymond into getting suspended.  It's still on Dray for retaliating, but I am not surprised Lebron had a monster game when one of the best defenders on the other team was out.  |Warriors|1
it took a combined 82 points from lebron/kyrie and a draymond green suspension for them to beat the warriors.  i wouldnt bank on that happening again.||3
Well played, Cavs.|Warriors|3
Lebron and kyrie holy fuck what an all time performace. 41 from both fucking nuts cavs can take game 6 if they keep beign aggresive draymond or not|Cavaliers|2
Really good game by the Cavs. My only question is this: is that performance by LeBron sustainable. He shot really well from outside the paint.|Bulls|2
Draymond literally ghosted tonight, overrated|[GSW] Stephen Curry|1
Does he look like a bitch?\n\nMan, I just thought it was funny that all these family members, etc. were calling out Lebron for being a crybaby when things didn't go his way -- when they were being crybabies because one thing didn't go their way. ||3
I am a man and a father of 3 kids and Stephen Curry|Thunder|2
Dubs couldn't make a bucket in the second half and still only lost by 15...Yeesh, second championship will be won in Cleveland again.|Celtics|3
hahahahah fuck you r/nba|[CLE] LeBron James|1
The people here acting like its LeBrons fault that Draymond has been nuttapping players all playoffs long and finally got enough flagrant foul points to be suspended is ridiculous. Draymond is getting those flagrants on his own. No one is asking to be ball tapped |Cavaliers|2
no one is asking to be stepped over either, but hey lets not mention that right?||3
You don't get suspended for stepping over someone, are you really this dense?|Pistons|1
Because stepping over someone is equal to a nut shot...|Cavaliers|1
Even if they gave him a flagrant for it he wouldn't have been suspended. He had 4 points in the system. It's his fault. He should've been suspended earlier against OKC anyway...now whether or not tithe point system is fair or not to players on teams that go deep in the playoffs is a more valid argument|Cavaliers|2
Of course lebron asked to be ball tapped.  He put his balls on the line and it turned out to be a winning strategy.  |Heat|5
Kyrie beat Steph at his own game tonight. |Rockets|3
Slaughtered* 22/31 vs. 13/35 from the field. 71% vs 42% |NBA|1

"Unanimous" MVP|Spurs|2
Absolutely stunning, brilliant, legendary performance from Lebron and Irving. They took everything the Warriors gave them and chucked it right back at their faces. It\'s weird how vulnerable the Warriors seem right now. Losing Bogut is a huge blow, and even though Green will be back for game 6, the momentum feels to have shifted to Cleveland. \n\nThis game had all the feel of a \'live by the three, die by the three" sort of game for GSW. Where normally that truism doesn\'t apply because they\'re so good defensively (and *so* good at shooting the long ball) and playing as a unit. But I think you can stamp it on tonight\'s performance. \n\nI tentatively think Kerr has to share some responsibility for this loss. It\'s true enough that you want to live with Lebron and Irving taking jumpers, but only to a point, right? He reiterated that they didn\'t want to change up because of that, and sure enough even after Irving *kept* hitting, he was still getting mostly single coverage with no real attempts to get the ball out of his hands. But then ultimately, even if they got it out of *his* hands, Lebron was so hot it probably wouldn\'t have mattered much. \n\nWarriors really missed Bogut and they really missed Draymond. Trading buckets for most of the game until theirs dried up while the Cavs (really just K and L) kept rolling. Also, crying jordan all of them for letting Richard Jefferson break their defense 4 times. ||1
When you take away bogus and donkey there's no one to hold or push smaller defenders 10 feet off the perimeter with those sweet moving screens. That's half the splash bros game.|Cavaliers|1

All of it. Veteran minimum /s but seriously he played so bad. 2 of 14 on really open looks as well. I don't how stupid a team has got to be to max him, but he is not good enough to be the first or second option for any team. |Bullets|1

No way they win two more games playing like that. \nI mean, it worked; they won. But Kyrie and Lebron balied them out with some incredible shot-making. Golden State also missed a lot of open threes \xe2\x80\x93 and big men.

Hopefully the Cavs can somewhat recreate this performance in game 6 so we can have a game 7.||1
I don't understand how Steph goes full possessions without touching the ball, multiple possessions, and you get Iggy or Harrison Barnes jacking up a shot. Put the ball in his hands|Pistons|1
Say what you will about the NBA, about Adam Silver, about the cavs organization, and about Draymond Green's suspension, but the Warriors went ABSOLUTE ZERO COLD for the last 8 minutes of this game. It's on 2nd half Steph and Klay to hit those shots, and it's on Harrison Barnes to actually show up for this to actually be a game.|[PHO] Yuta Tabuse|1
I think LeBron and Kyrie played amazing but it seemed like a ton of isolation or PnR plays. It doesn't seem like they changed much from games 1-5 and I don't think they'll be able to repeat those types of games two more times. Regardless, that was an amazing game from the Cavs tonight. An all time performance. |76ers|1
Forty Two Fucking Minutes....Dear God....How can it last?|[ATL] Tiago Splitter|1
Harrison Barnes, if you're gonna get 5-6 wide open looks at the 3 point in a row. PLEASE FUCKING HIT A FEW OF THEM. God damn and to think he's probably gonna get a max deal.\n\nThe rest: Warriors couldn't buy a shot to fall in the 4th, Cavs played insane. Kyrie and Lebron carried the shit outta them. Can't wait for game 6.|Warriors Bandwagon|1

I know we lost this game due to two incredible performances from Kyrie and James and our lack of good looks in the 2nd half\xe2\x80\xa6 but if Cavs take this series now I will remain forever salty about that Draymond Green suspension and credit Cavs victory entirely to that!\n\n\nScrew rationality!|Warriors|1
there goes harrison barnes's max|Spurs|1
I know everyone turned on Lebron but holy fuck what a heroic performance and he gives all the credit to Kyrie in the post game interview.|Raptors|1
Ty Lue gets a W by sitting on his and watching Kyrie and Lebron go off. Real winner here lol.|Knicks|1
Look at how dejected the warriors were leaving the floor.  That's pathetic.  \n\nGreen must be the entirety of their spine.|Charlotte Hornets|1
Kyrie was out here doing [the running man](https://usatftw.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/kyrie-running-man.gif?w=1000) on these Warriors man |Raptors|1
Man, the Warriors missed Green's defensive and leadership energy today BAD. They missed tons of open shots and made numerous careless passes in the second half. It seems like they didn't score at all in the second half. Meanwhile, Kyrie played INSANE tonight. ||1
If there's anything I've learned from watching the NBA for the past 12 years it's to never ever make LeBron angry.|Raptors|1
41/16/7/3/3 with 50% shooting. What a bitch right?|Cavaliers|1
Give Varejao the Oscar already. The NBA should also establish the Anderson Varejao most valuable flopper award.|Wizards|1

What's up with the shitty Lakers fans in here?|Cavaliers|1
Gotta say I would love a seven game series of games like this. Fantastic performances all around|Timberwolves|1
If Kyrie was 6\'6" he would be the best SG in the league|Raptors|1
All time great game by LeBron,\n\nBut I don't think it matters.\n\nYou got the best possible performances imaginable about he and Kyrie, and clearly Draymond not playing was a major factor.\n\nJust don't see anyway in hell they beat this team 3 in a row, when that was as close to a best case scenario game as possible. |Bulls|1
Love with two points is not a best case scenario, though. I think you are right that the dubs will bounce back, but Cleveland is a good team with a legit chance to win.|Supersonics|1
Nothing from this series leads me to believe Kevin Love will do anything.\n\nThis was the one game with Green out he should hypothetically have been effective, and he wasn't.\n\nThe Cavs other win was the game he didn't play in. |Bulls|1
They can win game 6, really doubt they win game 7.|Cavaliers|1
I'm happy for Kyrie. That was a huge game on the biggest stage. ||1
FUCK THE HATERS THATS MY DAWG KYRIE RIGHT THERE|[CLE] Kyrie Irving|1
I hope the Cavs win game 6 just so Curry can drain some ridiculous last second shot from midcourt to win game 7.||1

Warriors deserved to lose this game. Obviously no Green hurt them, but there were multiple times in the second half where they didn't capitalize on open looks or just turned the ball over going for highlight plays.\n\nI hope this game wakes them up and shows them that they'll actually have to play to win and not just show up.|[LAL] Kobe Bryant|1

LeBron and Kyrie can easily do this again. Kyrie has been putting up buckets and LeBron is LeBron. The only worry is Draymond coming back. He's a good ass player, Steph is simply not good without him, and he might be in LeBrons head who knows? Kevin Love has to get his shit together though if he does then oh boy we are setup for one hell of a finish to the series. |Heat|1

Wow what an exceptionally well refereed game! ||1
It's unlikely, but it would be amazing if the Warriors ended up losing when they were 3-1 up after they did that to the Thunder.||1

So people with more NBA knowledge than me - can the Cavs feasibly move love this offseason? Not to knee jerk, and he did well in the early rounds, but the Cavs are in the middle of their second straight finals with or without him|NBA|1
Yes, def. He's valuable. Honestly he may just not fit in ||1

GG Cavs--- extending this NBA season a little longer. Herculean by LeBron. \n\nSeemed like the basket had a lid on it in the second half. I can't say it's because of the Cavs blistering defense, either, seemed like a lot of missed open looks. Surprised that without Draymond these two teams simply look evenly matched. |[GSW] Klay Thompson|1

**ILL SEE YOU ALL AT THE PARROT ON THURSDAY!**|Cavaliers|1
Draymond is the most important player on that team. They looked awful on defense tonight. Obviously a great individual performance by Lebron and kyrie. K love though... Him and RJ need to switch minutes played. Warriors live and die by the 3 ||1
Harrison Barnes needs to knock down those wide open shots. He has the easiest job on the floor for this team and he needs to get it done. \n\nLeBron and Kyrie just straight dominated. Legendary performances. Can't wait for Game 6|Nets|1
Draymond when you call a man a bitch....put a little respeck on it next time||1
How do you respectfully call someone a bitch? Mr. Bitch? King Bitch? LeBitch?|Lakers|1
I still don't like LeBron but I respect him. More surprised by Kyrie. He took bad shots but he made them and that's what matters. KLive needs to show up if they want to win. They can't expect Golden State to miss these many wide open looks from 3 (I'm looking at you Barnes) again.|Supersonics|1
Never again Harrison Barnes. Never. Again.|Warriors|1
I really want lebron to rock a monk-style haircut and then go out and dunk on people. |Pistons|1

Unbelievable game from Kyrie and Lebron. Warriors just couldn't hang in the second half.  \n\nRooting for the Warriors I'm bummed they couldn't close this out early at home. As a basketball fan, I'm happy we at least get more basketball.|Timberwolves|1
Meanwhile, the Oakland A's are up 10-2 in the top of the 5th.|76ers|1

draymond not being in the game is what got him going||1
Great game from Kyrie and LeBron but dear god what has happened to Curry? Before polls excuse him due to injuries please take in mind the minutes he is playing; if he was truly that injured why would Kerr / Curry decide it's still best for him to play this much if true ?|Hawks|1
You could argue that Kerr just needs him to try and go regardless. Since its their best chance to win the finals\n\nNo excuses though,if Irving and love missing most of the finals last year was irrelevant then the Warriors can't have any excuses this time around|[MIA] Dwyane Wade|1
Kyrie was stupid good. LeBron ran out of steam towards the end and Kyrie just kept lighting people up.|Timberwolves|1
One of the greatest finals performances I have ever seen.  Take your pick as to who I am talking about.  |Raptors|1
Incredible performance by both Lebron and Kyrie tonight. I was expecting them to fade, but they stepped up even more when the Cavs cooled off in the second half. \n\nGolden State had a lot of chances to make it a game in the fourth quarter and shots simply did not fall. Barnes had a lot more shots than he usually does, and those open looks did not fall. Even his patented go-ahead or lead cutting threes did not fall. Even for Curry and Klay. \n\nMissing Green's energy and shot making really hurt the guys and forced bench players into more minutes. \n\nGame 6 in Cleveland is not going to be easy for either team. Hoping Warriors can close out. I can't take waiting for three more days like this. |Magic|1
2nd half didnt do justice for what was a brilliant 1st half|Raptors|1
Uncle Drew is a baller.||1
Curry's 25 were the quietest 25 I've seen in a while.\n\nIf he plays MVP level, he's hoisting a trophy right now. Even with Kyrie/Lebron dad dickin all over the place.|Cavaliers Bandwagon|1
32 minutes and you get 2 points and 3 rebounds. Holy fucking shit.|Raptors|1
What's the flagrant foul point system situation? How many more does Draymond get until he's in danger of another suspension?|Cavaliers|1
I'm about 90% sure that it doesn't reset and he just keeps getting suspensions for every flagrant for the rest of the postseason.||1
I'm going to feel sorry for any team that wants to pay Barnes the max he wants.|Warriors|1
NBA is fixed. Cleveland wins in 7... Controversy ensues lol||1
Its not over. |[OKC] Russell Westbrook|1
At times the Warriors looked shell shocked going to the rim. Too many smart switches by the Cavs in the paint, and Lebron roasted anyone with a late drive to the basket. Later in the game you saw Andre pass when he should have driven to the hoop. Just bad around the net.|[GSW] Draymond Green|1

The Warriors really needed Harrison Barnes to step up and fill Draymond's role. Or even play to his normal standards. He really dropped the ball here, contract in doubt|Nets|1

Lebron is like that kid in your class that blew off doing his final paper until the morning it was due, wrote it during homeroom and lunch, and gets a 95.|Hawks|1
Tonight really showed how much of an impact Draymond Green has for the Warriors on defense. LeBron and Kyrie played great, but LeBrons opportunities and some of Kyries came from a compromised defense. Still, kudos to the LeBron and Kyrie for stepping up and taking advantage. On another note, if Barnes could make a shot this would've been a much different game.|Trail Blazers|1
KYRIE IS A BAD MAN|Cavaliers|1
Great performance tonight by the Big 3. Combined for 84 tonight... They'll need to do that in two more games.|Cavaliers|1
Kevin Love...33 min, 2 pts, 3 reb, 4 fouls and 2 TO...I know Kyrie and Lebron took over but god damn this is an elimination game, I don't know how you can be more invisible than that. His shot wasn't there but he literally was doing nothing, like Curry was out rebounding him and getting the ball before he could. He literally was a ghost out there for 33min...|Cavaliers|1
Curry couldn't hit the broad side of a barn in the forth. And Harrison Barnes looked awful all night. Iguodala wasn't great either.|Bucks|1

Don't think Cleveland can sustain any of this in game 6 - really needs Love to step up especially with Green back. Have a feeling there are going to be some tears in Cleveland.\n\n\n\nI do think this is a coming of age game for Kyrie. Dude proved himself on both ends, if he ends up taking the next step as a player or ends up being the guy on a team that wins a ring I think people will go back to this game and say this is where he legitimatized himself as a star.|Knicks|1
It was the same stuff we criticized them for in G1/2/4.  They just made a shit ton of crazy shots, but it was still straight hero ball.  \n\nIt's kind of remarkable the Warriors' shooting fell apart first since they were still getting fairly open looks, but it happens.|Pistons|1

WHY IS THE NEXT GAME SO FARRRRRRRR|Supersonics|1
Obviously the biggest keys in this game were the Warriors poor defense and the great shot making of Kyrie and LBJ...\n\nBut the other thing I thought killed GSW was a lot of really funky transition plays. They had like 2 v 1s and 3 v 1s that ended with one guy just bodying into a defender and stuff. |Bulls|1
Green will be back!! Watch them snatch the rings in Cleveland, Ohio. Warriors are taking this in 6. Dayum Curry seem to be struggling BY HIS LOFTY STANDARDS.||1
By any standards.||1
Not really.  You take it for granted that he gets 20+, maybe even 30+.  ||1
Kevin Love 2 pts and 3 rbs in 33 min wtf||1
As good as this win must feel, Kyrie and Lebron had to literally have one of the best games by 2 teammates in finals history...can't see that happening 2 more times.|Cavaliers|1

Are we ruling out the possibility that when LeBron felt Dray\'s punch to his balls, he had a "GOTCHA BITCH!" and created a scene to cause the suspension? Because if that\'s the case, then LeBron is a fucking genius! lol|Suns|1
It's possible, but Lebron still lost his cool that game.  The Cavs were still in the game (not sure if they had the lead at that point but it was close), and Lebron made a lot of reckless decisions at the end of the game.\n\nSo the idea of the clear-minded Lebron playing Draymond is a bit far fetched.  Both guys were playing like dummies.|Pistons|1

Do you think Kevin love is actually friends with these guys? Like he actually hangs out with them and stuff?|Bulls|1
HOT TAKES NOW PLEASE ||1
The Warriors obviously missed Draymonds spark, but one of the keys to the game is it seemed like whenever the Warriors hit a 3 in the first 3 quarters (they were shooting pretty well until the 4th) either LeBron or Kyrie would answer immediately.  I'm pretty sure 3 of LeBrons 4 3's came right after a 3 point make by the Warriors.  |Cavaliers|1

Y'know, I really thought the Cavs were done for, I hoped they'd win, but I thought it was unlikely, and then this happens. I'm so happy, and Lebron and Kyrie, holy shit. 41 each? Jesus. Also, I hope to God that Love gets his shit together next game.|East|1
Love 2 Pts come on man.|Heat|1
K Love legit looks like hes playing in slow motion.|Hawks|1
I knew something was wrong when Steph attempted a Harden.|Warriors|1
Can someone explain to me, how that +/- thing works? Like, i can see Love having 2 TOs and 2 points, for 1 of 5 - how can he have +18 still?||1
it's the change in score while you're getting minutes. if love played 48 minutes, had 0's in every stat, and the end score was 100-0, he would have a +100 +/-|Clippers|1
Thanks. Not a math-genious, but does that make any sense? Why and for what would you use that? Does it say anything about real efficiency?||1
Maybe over season long patterns ||1
I want to win Cleveland because Kyrie deserves the Finals MVP award. But whatever happens, may the best team win! ||1

Can't believe the Knicks gave away him, and JR Smith, for nothing!  And nobody even complained much here in NY, as we've watched them being major contributors in Cleveland 2 years in a row.||1

I guess they count a strip as a block rather than a steal.||2
We're kyrie and lebron just on fire tonight or was it the absence of draymond that allowed them to play like I've never send the play this finals? To me lebron had that look on his face like when he played for Miami and he dropped 40 something points on the Celtics a few years ago||1
If you had told me that GSW would outrebound the Cavs, take more FT, have more assists... I would have assumed a healthy win.  Wow.||1
hi skip bayless|[NYK] Jamal Crawford|2
Um, ew?||1
I keep hearing that Harrison Barnes is a really good player. I still haven't seen a single game where he played well enough not to just think he put up good stats because the opposing team is too focused on Steph and Klay to bother playing real D on him. \n\nAlso, Kevin Love's +/- from last night is soooooo contrary to what he actually contributed to the Cavs.|Bulls|1
Harrison Barnes had the biggest hype of anyone that came to Carolina since I've been alive. They talked about him like he was the second coming of Jordan. But never really showed up. He would have some great performances, but it was more underwhelming than impressive. So this is the Barnes I am used to. |Spurs|0
Curious to see if Lebron will be able to continue to drive to basket once Draymond returns. I have to think one of the main reasons Lebron hasn't been driving as much is because of the combination of Iggy and Draymond rather that one of them individually.||1
he won't. the reason he could so easily is bc the cavs are running our bigs out to switch on their pick and roll. with draymond out there, that switch is seamless for us on defense. with ezeli, bogut, and varejao...lebron had a fucking feast and deservedly so.\n\n|Warriors|1
why is kevin love so trash?|Clippers|1
White|Hawks|2
Is there any reason why the Warriors went away from the steph/klay pick and pops in the second half? It seemed very successful in the first half yet I hardly saw them use it in the second||1
One is going to 7|Lakers|1
Lmao talk shit all you want, but I refuse to be really worried yet due to 4 basic reasons:\n1) Obviously no Draymond Green was a huge defensive loss for the Dubs\n2) Lebron had a good night, but let's be honest he was uncharacteristically good from range, and if you're relying on Lebron's jumpshot to win a series, you're gonna have a bad time.\n3) It was still a two man game. Love didn't do jack shit and literally only Kyrie and Lebron did anything meaningful. They still iso'ed a lot, and we all know that's not gonna work out in the long run.\n4) it's still 3-2. The Dubs always bounce back after losses, and Draymond will probably be more fired up than anybody. |Warriors|-3
The only thing that would put the warriors below 50% is a draymond flagrant, and even then there's still a solid chance.|Warriors|-3
Tonight reminds me of game 3 from this series. I can't see such a performance from both Kyrie and LBJ being sustainable over two more games, especially with Draymond returning.||2
The real winner here is Adam $ilver|Hornets|1
Klay Thompson with 37 points and a -21 +/-? Should've benched him. What a scrub.|Cavaliers|1
Honestly though, kyrie beat him on defense with tough shots. Plus the team expected barnes to do better than 2/14 on open shots|Warriors|2
Barnes really hurt them tonight.  And the bench was MIA.||0
Am I crazy for thinking this might have been Lebron's best game besides the Pistons game 5 and Boston game 6? I mean 41/16/7/3/3/ with only two turnovers is unreal. But also Kyrie is on fire right now; all they need is Lebron and Kyrie to do this two more times. Why not right? |Knicks|3
I thought it was Pistons game 4 ?|Cavaliers|1

Draymond Green pretty much a poor man's Lebron. Warriors really missed his all-around game and energy |Cavaliers|1
Big W fan here, but man, GG Cavs. Not going to beat that performance. Class act Irving, and Bron is no doubt the most dominant player in the association. That said, Ws are a better team, and will grind this series out. ||1
LeBron's statline is unreal. Kyrie shot the lights out.\n\nDraymond was missed tonight.|NBA|1
Lol Lebron aint even answering the questions, he just talking bout whatever he want|Timberwolves|1
YEAH!  I got drunk and started talking to my roommate and forgot about this game.  WHOOOOO.  LEBRON AND KYRIE GOT ALL THE POINTS.  Literally.  What the fuck?  Only five other dudes got points AT ALL.  That doesn't bode well, but it hasn't since the beginning.  |Grizzlies|1
That is how a real MVP gets it done in the finals|[LAL] Kobe Bryant|1

8 for 21 shooting for the unanimous mvp.|[DET] Andre Drummond|1
He was 11 for 25 including 7 for 13 from 3 point range for 38 points the game before. Your point?|Spurs|0
One game out of 5 so far would be my point.  Plus shouldn't the MVP be expected to put together a better game at home with the chance to put the series away?  Green is their MVP. This game made that clear|Cavaliers|1
So you take one game out of context to put his 80 game unanimous performance in the regular season into disrepute?\n\n- Curry is playing through ankle AND knee injuries he sustained during the Houston series.  There is no doubt these injuries are affecting him.  \nIn games where GS won easily they sat Curry a lot earlier to preserve his strength for the next one.\n\n- When Curry actually tries in a playoff game and scores over 28 points, the Warriors win.  That has been a fact during the playoffs.\n\n- Curry scored 40 points off the bench in game 4 against Portland.  If that isn't MVP-like then what is?\n\n- Before the finals, the Warriors have played through 17 games including an incredibly tough 7 game series against OKC where they had to come back from 1-3 down.  Curry averaged nearly 28 points per game in that series.  \n\n- The Cavs have played just 14 games for a pretty worry-free playoff journey to the finals.\n\n- The Warriors struggle when one of their key players struggle or is out because they play so well together.  However, there was no way they could have won the OKC without Curry and there is no way they would have any shot of winning the finals without him either.  Green, Thompson, Bogut, Iggy, Livingston etc have all had MVP moments during these playoffs but it is Curry that guarantees a win when he gets hot (lost just 3 games during the regular seasons when he scored 30 points or more 40 times).  |Spurs|0
Aren't you taking one game out of context talking about the Portland game?\n\n\nAnd the Cavs playoff road hasn't been any easier than Golden States'. Sorry if series against Houston and Portland (who only got there because the entire Clippers team was hurt)don't impress me.  And the Thunder and Raptors won about the same amount of games.\n\n\nSorry that I'll take my shots at Curry, which are warranted, after everyone has been up his ass all year.  He hasn't been great this Finals and wasn't last finals either.\n\n|Cavaliers|0
> Aren't you taking one game out of context talking about the Portland game?\n\nNot really, it is hard to score 40 coming off the bench in just 36 minutes.  Steph also scored over 30 points this season 40 times, over 40 points 13 times and over 50 points 3 times.  Did you know he shattered the 3 point record this season? Probably not.  Curry was far and away the clear MVP winner of both seasons, you would have to be an idiot to think otherwise.\n\n> And the Cavs playoff road hasn't been any easier than Golden States'. Sorry if series against Houston and Portland (who only got there because the entire Clippers team was hurt)don't impress me. And the Thunder and Raptors won about the same amount of games.\n\nAnd Cleveland from the east is supposed to be impressive?  We're the west bro, we beat each other up long before we can get to the finals.  Lebron could not and cannot play in our conference which is why he's on your team.  \n\n> Sorry that I'll take my shots at Curry, which are warranted, after everyone has been up his ass all year. He hasn't been great this Finals and wasn't last finals either.\n\nStay salty bro, I'm not even a Warriors fan but they are a much better team than the Cavs, their 73-9 record proves it.|Spurs|1
Lol.  Did I say the Cavs road was impressive? Nope. And yes you praising Curry for 1 game is taking said game out of context. Who cares what he did in the 2nd round? The bigger the stage is getting the worse he's been.  You really can't argue that.  And salty? No. The Cavs should lose. I don't like it but I'm not idiot. You however. Probably are|Cavaliers|1
Er...just in case you missed it and I added some more info in case you missed those too:\n\n> Aren't you taking one game out of context talking about the Portland game?\n\nNot really, it is hard to score 40 coming off the bench in just 36 minutes.  \nSteph also scored over 30 points this season 40 times, over 40 points 13 times and over 50 points 3 times.

Steph was phenomenal coming back from injury coming off the bench against Portland, he was phenomenal averaging nearly 28 points per game against an OKC that beat a 67-15 team.  \n\nAs for the finals series, it has been a complete snoozefest in the first 2 games because Cleveland was sucking so badly and fans were leaving.  The differences between the teams was too great.  That's right, you guys were so fucking boring and pathetic that we actually had to bandwagon to Cleveland's side just to help them make it a series lol|Spurs|1
> As for the finals series, it has been a complete snoozefest in the first 2 games because Cleveland was sucking so badly and fans were leaving. The differences between the teams was too great.\n\nI see you don't bring up Game 3 when the Cavs won by 30, or Game 5, when the Warriors got embarrassed so badly their fans started leaving with 4 minutes left in the game.|[LAC] Quentin Richardson|1
What's your point?  The Warriors thrashed the Cavs in Game 2 by 33 and Curry didn't even play the last 7 minutes.  Nobody remembers game 3 because the Warriors won Game 4 pretty easily. |Spurs|1
When you talk about the first ever unanimous MVP please make sure to put the "first ever unanimous" before the MVP. Just so everyone recognizes||1
I\'m so tired of this argument that Green is the "real MVP" because he\'s having a good series (when on the floor). That the mere fact the Warriors can play well without Steph means he must not be that valuable (as if Green wasn\'t mediocre, and carried by the splash bros, in the OKC series). I\'m sorry the Warriors, as a 73 win team, don\'t have any one player they depend on so much they immediately become trash without. Green playing well with far less attention on him does not make him better than Curry. It\'s just that Green and Curry play in a SYSTEM that allows everyone to contribute to their maximum\xe2\x80\x94which is why they won 73 games. Depending on the matchup, anyone can step up.\n\nThey\'re not the Cavs, who are Gm\'d and coached by LeBron, in addition to him being their best defensive player, with 90% of their offensive system consisting on him pounding the ball for drive and kicks. LeBron might still be the best all-around basketball player in the league. No one can do everything the way LeBron can. But that\'s a pretty dumb metric, because you\'re better off spreading those duties out. The Warriors did, and won 73 games. The Spurs did back in the Miami days, and had a better offense AND defense, and were a miracle Ray Allen 3 from beating him in back to back finals (easily dominating the rematch). \n\nEven Phil Jackson had Scottie take the defensive and ball handling responsibilities.  On the other hand, the Cavs "system" is that LeBron is their go-to ballhandler/playmaker, rebounder, scorer, rim protector, wing stopper, in addition to being their Head Coach and GM. Only he can do that, but it\'s still not the ideal way to actually build a team. \n\nI\'m rooting for the Cavs to pull off the comeback because I\'d love to see Green suffer for his repeated cheap bullshit, and I\'d love to see people shut up about LeBron not being a great playoff player forever. But even if that happens, I don\'t think the Cavs are actually the better team (sometimes underdogs get lucky). You can\'t win 73 games by relying on one player to do everything, so it\'s really dumb to hold it against the guys on GS that they aren\'t doing everything. Curry is having a mediocre series, but anyone who is blaming him because he\'s not the entire system vs every matchup is missing the plot entirely. The Patriots were always better without Brady than the Colts were without Manning. It doesn\'t mean Manning was better. It means that Belicheck actually has a system past "let my star do everything."||4
The NBA, by suspending Green in this game, took an economic decision. It decided to protect its legacy of superstar players (i.e. Lebron in this case) and of finals competition. Both means more profits for the NBA in the long run.\n\nHere is my prediction: the Cavs will be stepped on next game. They will lose emphatically to the GSW. But there will be few voices doubting Lebron's status. Lebron will continue to be marketable, and the GSW will have won the championship which they rightly deserve.\n\nPersonally I want the Cavs to win it because I like NBA basketball to have its larger-than-life superstars. I doubt Curry will ever be such, and I doubt we will see any more superstars like Lebron from now on, since the game has been changed to be more about the team and less about the players.\n||2
I also feel like they wanted one of the splash bros to go off and earn the series MVP.||1
Hmm I hope they win at home in The Land! They were not favored tonight and won.||1

There's absolutely no way that James and Kyrie play this well in game 6 or 7.  It just won't happen.  \n\nWarriors will get Draymond back, and most likely Curry will shoot better than 30%.\n\nCavs get another game at home.\n\nThe Warriors can only improve from this past game.  I can't see any scenario where Cleveland plays better than they did tonight.\n\nI definitely think the Warriors should close out this serious on Thursday.||1

You really gotta give the Cavs props for what they did tonight. Being down 1-3 against a 73-win team at home. You wouldn't wish that on anyone, but they still pulled it off. ||1
Not as impressive without Green on the floor.||1
For all the hate Love is getting, he diddddd put up a +18. Which is a flawed indicator yes, but he wasn't forcing the issue and played smart basketball. His defensive effort has been there(two blocks tonight) and he didn't get roasted by the wings he was slated against all night.|Kings|1
He was on the floor with LeBron and Kyrie putting up a double 40... you could have been out there in a wheelchair tonight and racked up a +20.|Heat|3
If Lebron and Kyrie are dropping 40 a piece what more do you want from him than floor spacing, moving the ball, setting good screens, and playing hard defense? He got like 5 shot attempts and Lebron was going crazy on the boards, overall he performed well enough with what was given to him|Kings|1
I agree, but it explains how Love gets such a high +/- without doing much - it's a team/lineup stat, not an individual stat.|Heat|2
Kevin Love is WORTHLESS. \n\nWhen will Lue realize that?\n\n\nHe played 40 minutes and had 2 points and 3 rebounds. \n\n\nYou could plug in almost any other player in the NBA and the stats would have been better. |76ers|1
I think he played a decent game that didn't show up in the stat sheet. Gave up his shots to the far better Kyrie and LeBron tonight and just hustled where he could. I think he could have done a little better and secured a few more rebounds. But LeBron was skying over him for every board - LeBron showed us how greedy he could be when he really wants to. He has to actively avoid getting 40/15/7 every single game.|Heat|0
I couldn't understand why he had so many minutes. Dude didn't contribute in any way. ||0
he did on defense and setting up screens, and not doing what Harrison Barnes was doing by chucking a bunch of bad 3's|Lakers|1

Ah good point! That is something to hug about.|Raptors|0
Aside from a dominating performance from LeBron and Kyrie, the Warriors shot themselves out of this game. Turnovers were just about equal but Cavs definitely took advantage more than the Warriors did. Poor shooting night all around from the Warriors. Curry and Thompson did most of the work but fucking Barnes was god awful tonight. He never shows up when we need him, and when he does we're already losing badly. Fuck Barnes. He can leave this summer. Getting the win without Green tonight was going to be tough but it kinda felt like they gave up in the second half. Also fuck that home crowd man. It's fucking elimination game in the fucking finals. Make some fucking noise and cheer your team on. Those defense chants were weak as fuck. |Warriors|1
Lebron and Kyrie just put their balls on our head, but hey...|Warriors|1

I still feel like Kyrie was playing hero ball. But tonight his shots were going in, so nobody's gonna second guess him.|Bulls|1

Warriors really needed someone to step up in the absence of Green. Perfect opportunity for a guy like Barnes to do so. He fucking no-showed. Above all else, that is what I'm most disappointed in. Even though I despise LeBron, the dude is going to get his. Kyrie played out of his mind. Have to give them props. The real story though is that no one stepped up for the Warriors besides Klay. \n\n|Warriors|1

because he had one of the greatest finals games of all time? \n\nSteph and Klay have had 5 straight games without having to face Green and they haven't gone off for 41/16/7/3/3. It's not like he's beating Kyrie to meet Love at the rim. That would be easy. ||0

I\'m saying it\'s not easy to do what LeBron did against an NBA defense, Green or not. Yes, it\'s easier to do it when Green isn\'t playing. Why does it only "remarkable" for Lebron if he\'s going directly up against one of the top 2 defensive players in the league? \n\nFor 35 years people have played in finals games, mostly without having to face Green, and none of them put up 40/15/7. Lebron just did that, while being the best defensive player on the court for either team. It\'s an all time dominant performance regardless, because *no one had done it for 35 years.* He just took the defining Magic Johnson finals game, and added MVP defense onto it. The absence of one player doesn\'t negate how exceptional that is. It can\'t, because in the other 225 or so finals games since Magic\'s game 6\xe2\x80\x94plenty of them without a defender of Green\'s calibre\xe2\x80\x94 it had never been duplicated. There was a year the Nets made the finals. ||6
Of course it's hard and it was a great performance. I just don't think it happens if Draymond is on the court.|Pistons|0
It feels like anyone who hates on Lebron James doesn't know anything about basketball lol. He to me, is the 2nd best player of all time if not the best. This game right here shows this as well. Greatness. And Draymond is the real bitch kicking and punching guys in the dicks every series. ||-1
This is why I have an irrational hate towards most of the Warriors' fanbase. They treat Curry as the second coming, but completely dismiss James for who he is. Don't get me wrong, Curry is a great player, and he deserves all the accolades he's getting right now, but Lebron James is fucking Lebron James. He will go down as one of the greatest to have ever played the game.\n\nWhen people spew Lebron hate, just hit them back with 7 of 13...Lebron has taken a team to the NBA Finals 7 out of the 13 years he has been in the league. Will usually shut most of the haters up.||1
Doesn't shut me up.  He's done that in a historically weak Eastern conference by surrounding himself with other stars.  It would be impressive if he was in the West.||0

Holy shit. My mom came into my room to bring me a plate of chicken nuggets and I literally screamed at her and hit the plate of chicken nuggets out of her hand. She started yelling and swearing at me and I slammed the door on her. I'm so distressed right now I don't know what to do. I didn't mean to do that to my mom but I'm literally in shock from the results tonight. I feel like I'm going to explode. Why the fucking fuck are they losing? This can't be happening. I'm having a fucking breakdown. I don't want to believe the world is so corrupt. I want a future to believe in. I want Curry to win a title for GS. I cannot fucking deal with this right now. It wasn't supposed to be like this, I thought they were supposed to win at home in the Oracle???? This is so fucked.||-2

Glad that dirty player Draymond was kept out.  Someone should welcome him back in game 6 with a kick to the nuts, then when he manages to get back in around the 3rd quarter we can consider he's served his time.\n\nI've never seen anything like it before.  His new defensive strategy seems to be to kick or hit opponents in the nuts.  Then you're a little scared of that and you hesitate.\n\nGreat game by Cleveland.||-1

He looks fierce, but actually he's a good guy.||5
At the end of the day, none of these guys are actually bad. Even though Draymond is the second coming of the Nutcracker, Lebron pulled a disrespectful walkover, and Varejao could win an Oscar with his flopping, they are all ok guys. People take a few instances of a player on the court way too seriously when accounting their overall character.  ||2

Draymond suspension isn't a excuse considering Love gave them nothing and the Cavs were unhealthy last year. All time elimination game performance, I wonder how we'll remember this if the Cavs end up not winning the series though.|Heat|0
LOL, please compare and contrast the difference in performance of Green and Love in the first 4 games of this series.\n\nThis wasn\'t an "off night" for Love, he has been horrid all series. |Bulls|0
What I'm saying is the Cavs managed to steal a road game with one of their three best players essentially being nothing at all. People shouldn't take away from\nLebron and Kyrie just cause we disagree with draymonds suspension.|Heat|2
Draymond being absent and Lebron/Kyrie having a big offensive night are related. ||1
I think a lot of us just agree with the suspension, and we're impressed with Lebron/Kyrie.  We're just skeptical they can repeat that performance with Draymond playing.|Pistons|3
What if the narrative of the Warriors success is totally wrong.\n\nWhat if the Warriors under new ownership made their first big trade for Bogut for a reason, because they knew they could not win without a true big man.  What if big men are not obsolete and without them to play some minutes the defense falls apart.\n\nWhat if the 3-point shooting revolution for big playoff games is not for everyone to jack up 3s, but only for the superstars.  Look at the distribution of who is making 3s say this game 5, it is far from uniform, instead clustered around two players for each team.\n\nWhat if the guys who should be shooting 3s are the guys you want shooting period.\n\nWhat if Golden State's success was based on defense, and if some key piece(s) are gone even their defense can fall completely apart if the other team has two players who can drive to the basket with authority.\n\nWhat if winning NBA championships really does come down to what a couple of superstar players do.  What if a team could invest in having the best coaches and foster the best teamwork only to have it not matter if the other team's superstars are simply better.||0

It's not so much the Warriors winning; it's Cleveland losing that makes me much more happier. |Warriors|-2
Spoken like a true 12-year-old|Pistons|1
Goddamn... Kyrie was unstoppable, making contested shot after contested shot. Lebron definitely stepped up. Despite that, I can't be too worried yet... considering literally they had to play their best game of playoffs so far. And the Warriors have proven that they can win in Cleveland with Draymond back.    |Warriors|-1
You're definitely right. We caught a break, and it took a career game for both Irving and James to pull this out. I still say Warriors win the series, but man, does this game feel good.|Cavaliers|1
Of course you should be happy. I admit as a basketball fan, Kyrie was making me smile inside. He was on fire. |Warriors|1
You must not have watched the game they dropped 25 3s.|Cavaliers|1
Lol... the stakes were definitely higher this game than against Atlanta.|Warriors|1
Yes, but that doesn't have anything to do with the best game in the playoffs.|Cavaliers|1
Whatever, I think the stakes do matter. If they had made 25 threes against the 76ers in the playoffs, I couldn't care less. Besides, I was referring to Kyrie and Lebron rather than team performance. Outside of those two, the Cavs were pretty average.|Warriors|-1
Warriors can also get blown the fuck out in Cleveland|Suns|3
Well duh. That's a given. But with Dray back and with a vengeance, I thinks it's pretty unlikely the Cavs blow us out.|Warriors|0

Let's not overreact, Green and Love were out tonight. |Celtics|-1
Thompson and Curry did enough.  Iggy did his part.  What jumps out to me is everyone else being MIA.||-1
Curry needed to do more imo. Bad turnovers and 5/14 from 3 with some really ill advised chucks hurt the Dubs despite his point total |Pistons|1
I agree that he didn't have a good game, but even with that it was enough for them to win.  Their bench might as well have not played at all.  Barnes was hot garbage, and Iggy disappeared after the first quarter.  I get that Curry will get crushed for not dropping 40 with the other stars, but I put this loss on the bench and the rest of the starters.||1
Yeah I forgot the circle jerk would go the other way|Warriors|-2
[deleted]||-6
Draymond deserved the suspension, but there is no doubt in my mind that the timing was rigged.  How he got away with what he has without suspension to this point is also questionable.  He should have been suspended vs OKC and GS shouldn't really be in the finals....but they wanted to make sure GS had a chance vs OKC so they would get the ratings.||0
Maybe Draymond should stop punching people in the crotch. The NBA didn't do anything - Draymond punched two different people in the crotch in the last THREE WEEKS. It's not rigged - that's just a dirty player.||1
I'll always be a Lebron James hater after the series of events that transpired in the past 48 hours. Fuck that man.\n\nWarriors, give Cleveland a taste of what a championship looks like (again) on Thursday.|Warriors|-6
And you blindly support the testical targeting emotionally unstable piece of crap that suits you for you every night? Sports makes idiots of us all.|Pistons|1
This series will go to game 7. The Cavs will destroy golden state in game 6. Steph Curry's FG% will be under 30. In game 7, Lebron will struggle to score and jack up an astronomical number of ill-advised jumpers. Curry will do the same but he will hit them. Curry, Thompson and Draymond will all average over 40% shooting. The Warriors will win by at least 11 points. I expect gold if my predictions are accurate. See you all on Sunday.|Bulls|-3
NBA got what they wanted congrats |Charlotte Hornets|-4
Of course they win when Draymond isn't there. At least they'll win in Cleveland & make it smell like Champagne again|Lakers|-3

No reason to Lebron and Kyrie can't attack the basket like that on Thursday.|Wizards|-1
Other than you know GSW having their full team....|Warriors|3
Honestly, I think they should bait Green into an early flagrant foul and get him tossed for Game 7 as well. \n\nI think Green is going to be so deep in his own head avoiding every technical and flagrant, his game is going to suffer greatly in a hostile environment in game 6.|Heat|4
I don't think he tries to avoid it though, he dares them to call it on him|Wizards|1
We're going to see OKC Game 3/4 100% bitch-made Green in Game 6 - guaranteed. |Heat|1

Going for 73 wins is sure going to look ridiculous if the Cavs can muscle past the Warriors the last 3 games with the Warriors all banged up.||-1

At the very least you should be upset at Draymond for that fucking stupid flagrant against the Rockets.  That one was completely meaningless.|Pistons|1
Indeed. It was unwarranted and stupid of Draymond to do that during that series. But that's not the call I have an issue with as you've probably seen in the other comments. Adam Silver doing two wrongs doesn't make it right|Warriors|0
We can't put blame on the league for taking him out. Yeah he's needed, but everyone else should've been able to step up. If Cavs don't get to blame last year on Irving and Love we can't be hypocrites. We just need to come out better as a whole and stop giving the ball up.||1
I honestly think it's just hogwash on how they suspended him the way they did. Lebron instigated the foul and gets away with a technical foul? Green just put his arms off to get off of him, the same that we all would have done. On top of that they upgrade the kick to the nuts from LAST series to a Flagrant 2? It's just incredibly convenient timing that's all. |Warriors|1
Was the suspension undeserved for hitting dudes in the nuts one too many times? ||4
Wowwwwwwwwww....you call that accidental tap to Lebron's nuts a hit? You'd probably do the same if someone teabagged the back of your head|Warriors|0
Draymond fucked you. If he is so important he shouldn't be doing dumb things to get suspended|Cavaliers|2
As I mentioned to someone else earlier, 2 wrongs don't make a right. He was given an unwarranted flagrant 1 which led up to him getting suspended. Although Adam Silver let him off the hook earlier in the playoffs with that nut kick, giving him trouble when there is none only just adds fuel to the fire.|Warriors|-1
I'd say draymond fucked up. But I already don't like him so I'm probably biased||2
Come on man. Everyone knows what LeBron did was straight up disrespectful and unnecessary. They should have just given them both a double tech and called it a day. Instead they give him a flagrant when it's uncalled for and upgrade a fragrant to 2, two weeks after the fact. What a joke|Warriors|-2
I totally agree this last incident was undeserving of a suspension. It's draymonds fault however for consistently committing flagrant fouls to the point he gets suspended. Imo he should have been suspended after kicking Steven Adams in the dick like they did to dhantay jones so I have absolutely no sympathy for draymond or the Warriors in this one. And I'm no Cleveland fan either. ||0
If the NBA with it's new commissioner wants to be taken seriously, consistency in rulings is key. If Adam Silver knows he made a terrible decision earlier in not suspending Draymond for the nut kick, it doesn't make it right by giving a suspension when they didn't deserve it. 2 wrongs don't make a right.|Warriors|1
Stop hitting people in the nuts multiple times in the post season and he wouldn't be in this spot. Iam sry but stepping over someone is not equal to nut shots|Cavaliers|1
Congrats to the Cavs. You asked the league to make the warriors tie one hand behind their back, they complied, and you won. \n\n|Celtics|-12
So you're comparing green to exactly 1/2 of the warriors total capabilities? Considering most his talents lie on kicking dicks, that's a pretty pathetic statement. ||1
So tired of Draymond having license to attack other players in the nuts.  Maybe that's why he was effective.||5

i never quite understand this argument. its not like they NEEDED to go 41 each, they were both just shooting really well and smartly kept being aggressive. what matters is the team as a whole spacing the floor, playing good defense, and getting the ball to the guys who are hot. could be any guys combining for 82 next game instead of those 2, same result as long as everything else is clicking|Pelicans|1

Did Kevin Love play to his potential?  Hell no.  But every shot that he could have taken but didn\'t was because it was contested.  He wasn\'t forcing the ball.  Yeah he could have been better on the boards and moved off the ball more but I think it\'s better for a player to only take 5 shots that are smart then to force a bunch of contested shots.  Bro only 2 turnovers, too.  To say he was "trash" is a bit harsh.  |Suns|0

Positives: Despite Kyrie and LeBron going off the Warriors were still in it for the majority of the 2nd half. Can't expect them to only shoot 27% like that in a half again. Shout out to Kyrie, that performance was really special and I'll remember hating him while simultaneously being in awe of him for the rest of my life. I have a massive amount of respect for that guy.\n\nNegatives: I don't know how Harrison continually missed wide open threes. He had two wide open threes with a chance to cut it, to I think 95-99, and missed them badly. You played great in Cleveland what happened? Harrison Barnes... BUM\n\nTransition defense, actually the defense in general, looked very shaky, especially that 3rd quarter. It allowed Kyrie to get really hot so that when they were actually doing a decent job of contesting it didn't matter, guy was just to on fire to care. Dubs definitely played better defense down the stretch but shots weren't falling so they couldn't climb back in. \n\nHow do you not get Klay more touches in the 2nd half? Straight carried in the 1st half but only ends up with 6 more shots than Barnes? Part of that is the Cavs did do a better job of keeping contact with him, but sometimes you just gotta get Klay to just hoist 3's.||0
The Warriors defense was trash without Green. We didn't really have an identity on either side of the ball without him we literally had no strategy we were just playing basketball. We can get away with it on offense cuz of klay and currys greatness but not on defense. Our defense played like one of the worst defenses in the league. Only good defense we played was Klay on Irving but he had an unreal game.|Warriors|0

Gilbert gets what he campaigned for (extra ticket $$), Kyrie has his "I really am really good" game, Lebron plays something that looks like basketball for once, and it\'s all possible because they took away a guy who was inches away from DPOY. \n\nSo the plan to beat the Ws is to suspend the DPOY.  Got it.\n\nAlso Harrison Barnes was awful and JR and Shump fouled Steph and Klay like 80% of their jumpers in the second half so that\'s fun.|[DET] Chauncey Billups|-5

Yall may be shitting on Kevin Love but somehow he was still +18 and Kyrie was only 2 more at +20 on the court for the game. The big three were the big three. |Cavaliers|-3
Yeah and Klay Thompson was red-hot with -21, +/- is useless in a single game context|Warriors|4
I saw Kyrie make klay do the Macarena multiple times. Maybe that's why his plus minus was all fucked up. Say what u will about love. But he played 30 plus minutes |[LAL] Vlade Divac|1
LMAO @ Kevin Love's 2 points. Guy is fucking soft. \n\nThat's not counting the points he gave up during the game.\n\n||-2
How can LeBron and Kyrie's performances really be justified?! Warriors were without their damn floor general and we act like they didn't have it easier than they should have?|Wizards|-7
you play whos in front of you. regardless of whether draymond was there or not they played fantastic.|[NBA] LeBron James|2
###FUCK LEBRON JAMES###||-7
Proud Lebron hater still here. Fuck Lebron and his soft ass.|Knicks|-3
Give it up man. He just had a performance only a few will ever have||2
After getting the other teams best defender suspended. K.|Knicks|0
How do you Cavs fans feel knowing that Silver gave you guys that win?||-7
So you truly believe that the NBA didn\'t suspend Green in the OKC series because he,"accidentally" kicked Adams in the nuts. No they didn\'t because it would have meant death to their "Golden Boys" and ratings. ||1
About the same way I feel when I bite into a sour-puss steak with too much salt.|Cavaliers|2
Same way Dubs fans feel about him handing them the OKC series by not suspending him....we don't give a shit|Cavaliers|4
Silver didn't make draymond hit people in the nuts multiple times. Accept that it was draymonds actions. Nobody else.|Cavaliers|5
That final flagrant was horseshit. ||-3
The last flagrant....wasn't a flagrant.  But keep pretending this suspension wasn't about extending the series.||0
oh so smacking at someones nuts and even swiping a second time afterwards just to be sure isn't worth a Flagrant now? |Cavaliers|1
Didn't come close to hitting him in the nuts.  Clearly on his thigh, and there was barely contact.  Weakest flagrant ever called.||0
Wahoo. League forced game 6 here we come. What a joke||-4
Yup Flopajo flops 3 times and gets the call everytime, Golden State has 3 more free throws then cleveland, TT gets hacked in the paint consistently with no calls but yeah the refs favored the Cavs\n\nGtfo with this bull shit |Cavaliers|2
There's no fix happening here. 2 guys playing iso and 1 guy playing d is what championships are made of||1
LeBitch and the league got exactly the outcome they were looking for|NBA|-3
Why is everyone shitting on K Love tonight. He was what his team needed. He didn't shoot much because Kyrie and Lebron were going off, but he was effective on both ends of the floor. Maybe he got exposed some on defense but overall the team played pretty great defense with him on the floor and it resulted in the highest +/- per minute of any Cav tonight. I'm not trying to say he was the best Cav by any stretch of the imagination, but he did what his team needed him to do and they got the win in part to him, not despite him. This may change next game with Draymond coming back, but for this game he did what he had to do.|Raptors Bandwagon|-3
ugh\n\n2 points. 3 rbs. 2 TOS. 4 PFs. K-Love.\n\nhow the fuck are people defending this?||0
I won't defend his performance (though his defense was solid) but I'll defend his place on this team to my grave. This Warriors team is just the worst matchup ever for him, but against more traditional 4s Love has been pretty great |[CLE] Zydrunas Ilgauskas|0
Bad matchups doesn't force him to not box out, not going after boards. That one play where Curry just beat him to the rebound in the 4th was just absolutely pathetic. He was utter garbage tonight through and through. ||2
He's clearly been affected mentally both due to the strain from the series and the bruising on his brain. I know he probably seems fine but it's exceedingly rare for a concussion to be truly healed in under a week. His play the entire season and honestly most of the rest of this playoffs showed his value|[CLE] Zydrunas Ilgauskas|0
> but for this game he did what he had to do.\n\nGetting the fuck out of the way|[PHI] Allen Iverson|2
Yo GSW fans.\n\nThat's why you don't poke the bear.\n\nEdit: hahaha the salt is reaaaaaaaaaaaaaal|Cavaliers|-4
Right, that's why the 'King' was down 3-1 coming into tonight?||0
I don't know what I expected lol|Raptors Bandwagon|-1
LeBron and Kyrie out here lookin like Dad Kratos and his Son|San Diego Clippers|-1
IM HERE FOR THE SALT|Lakers|-1
If you said GS would blow out the Cavs when they were up 9-3, never comment on anything basketball related ever again.|Cavaliers|-1
Warriors fans were straight up disrespectful tonight. If I had one shot every time they started booing when Bron touched the ball, I'd be fucking dead by now.\n\nStay classy, San Francisco.|[CLE] LeBron James|-1
Two guys down and monster games by two guys to beat us. Eh, we'll see you on Thursday. |Kings|-1
The Kings won't be seeing anyone for a long while...|[MIA] Hassan Whiteside|3
I wonder who they gonna try to suspend so they can win next game. |Heat|-1
It took the absolute best from Kyrie and LeBron AND GSW missing 15 of their last 17 3s.\n\nBoth of those things won't happen again. GSW should close it out in 6 on the road.\n||-1
What\'s with the "spoilers" tag on the post?  \n\nIf you\'ve recorded the game probably don\'t go online||-1
So does Lue keep his job now? What if they force a Game 7?|Knicks|-1
The Cavs were actually one botched offseason rehab of Mozgov from having great team height for all frontcourt positions.  Any chance the Cavs can somehow retain Mozgov this offseason?\n\nI am not sure of the exact timing, but when the Cavs were thinking of trading Wiggins for Love, the thought might have been that both Indiana and Chicago would have been threats to the Cavs.  Technically I believe the Cavs completed the trade for Love after the horrific injury to the Pacers Paul George, but on draft day it would not have seemed impossible for the Pacers to return the team that had given LeBron's Heat quite a bit of trouble in the playoffs minus Lance Stephenson, a team that even with Hibbert playing badly had decent size.||-1
How the fuck did curry have 3 blocks? Also lebron not playing like a scared to shoot bitch was very nice. Goes 7 but GS in a 16 point win to clinch.|Lakers|-1
He got a couple of strips that were counted as blocks.|[NYK] Jamal Crawford|1
Should the Cavs trade Kevin Love? \n||-1
Lebron is still a bitch|Warriors|-15
Then why are you the one who's bitching?||3
You just got fucked by a bitch.|NBA|5
Is Kevin Love the worst basketball player of all time?|Hornets|-5
Glad i didn't watch this farce.||-5
The Cavs play an ugly brand of fuckball.  No passing, just a ton of iso hero ball.||-5
They play plenty of iso compared to golden state, but they did have 15 assists to golden states 18|[CLE] Zydrunas Ilgauskas|2
I almost cried praying to God to let the warriors win tonight at home.  \nLet's go warriors! Win it all in G6!  \n  \nEdit: If anyone would kindly tell me why I'm getting downvotes, please do. I have only recently been into the NBA sub and don't understand what's acceptable here yet. Appreciate it.|NBA|-7
You won last year..||1
True, I honestly don't even know why it bothers me so much. The last six minutes were a pain to watch tho.|NBA|1
Because your best player gave up on his team in a winnable game (only down 9 with 4 minutes left)||2
Yeah, I'm really disappointed in Steph right now. Really questioning the unanimous MVP.|NBA|1
My dislike of the Cavs has gone to a fire brewed hatred.\n\nSo pissed the NBA got exactly what they wanted with that bullshit Draymond suspension. Now Bogut got hurt too, hope they close out in Cleveland. My nerves can't handle Game 7.|Warriors|-7
'cause you're a hater|Cavaliers|1
I am not a fan of LeBitch, but I am up for epic basketball, and boy, he delivered. Now the Warriors have to fight hard for the title, or just die. Awesome!||-5
Time for some respectful and reasonable discussion regarding the game.|Clippers|-2
FUCK THE HATERS, YOU ARE THE TRUE BITCHES.|[CLE] Kyrie Irving|-2
Lebron got what he wanted . Maybe we should all complain to the league after a game to suspend a player .|Warriors|-2
Oh shut the fuck up dude. Draymond is the dirtiest player in the league and deserves a suspension. It wasn't an accident he got himself in this spot. |Cavaliers|1
Lebron could've just walked around like a normal fucking person and everyone fucking knows it.|Warriors|-2
Yeah and Draymond could stop punching people in the balls. Ironic as fuck that Draymond is calling people a bitch when he's the one that acts like this.|Cavaliers|2
Are you fucking stupid? Do I have to spell it out for you? Lebron wouldn\'t have got "punched" in the balls if he had just walked around . It\'s not that hard to understand man shit. Whatever its old news. It\'ll be fun to see Cavs fans cry at their arena when we win.|Warriors|-2
That's fucking ridiculous dude. LeBron wouldn't have gotten punched in the balls if Draymond didn't punch him in the balls. I'm sorry Draymond can't handle something that has happened time and time again in competitive sports without this happening. \n\nHe wouldn't have gotten suspended if he hadn't time and time again gotten technical fouls and flagrants in these playoffs for being unable to handle himself. \n\nI'm sure Draymond appreciates that you're here to make all kinds of excuses for his idiotic behavior.|Cavaliers|2
Another throw away game to stretch out the series... Mo money mo money mo money! ||-2
[deleted]||-15
Unless he decides to do a flagrant to get ejected and misses out on game 7. |Rockets|2
"Sorry ass fans" yet you disrespect with nonsense. Stay Classy buddy|[LAL] Kobe Bryant|5
He's probably ten, he just learned how to trash talk|[CLE] LeBron James|1
Elimination games have such a different vibe when you don\'t have a dog in the fight. \n\n* LeBron could probably lose all his limbs in a tragic hairline restoration accident and get a head coaching position in a wheelchair. For all his unreal physical attributes, basketball IQ is probably his greatest attribute. And that says a ton. Not to say that he doesn\'t space out, or lose focus at times, because everyone does, but the guy can see shit happening before it does. He can figure out plays before they\'re run, and that\'s not even counting the plays he can blow up because he MEMORIZED THEM. One day soon, we\'re gonna look back at dude\'s career and sit in awe, the same way we did with Kobe. \n\n* Speaking of Lebron, he did everything I wanted and went straight 2012-2013 mode. Jumper was wet, he was aggressive, and he seemed fully willing to drop 60 if needed. Legitimately dirty to watch. If anything \n\n* Don\'t get it twisted either: LeBron\'s resurgence is directly related to Draymond sitting out tonight. His defensive IQ is remarkable. Honestly, I think Draymond\'s relationship to Steph is similar to that of Pippen to MJ: they can be that terrifying defensively, largely because the best player(s) to guard them happen to be their teammate. Hopefully LeBron can carry that positive momentum in his jumper forward. \n\n* I\'m not sure what to think about Kevin Love. He regularly seemes to alternate between overly aggressive, with a trash BBIQ to match, and completely timid where he seems either prescient or frozen. He\'s talented, for sure, but I think that serious consideration to the offensive and defensive systems need to be made. He really seems like he\'s hitting a glass ceiling in his play, and I really hope he puts it together. What\'s more, I hope that the Cleveland Front Office has a similar faith and keep him. That said, dude was a non fucking factor on both ends. Probably a net negative, knowing that they forced switches to get him on Curry.\n\n* Iggy needs to keep starting imo. I definitely think that his hands, even only on the help side, are enough to keep the Cavs jittery, and off balance. He stuck LeBron a bit too much for my liking early, and didn\'t sag to give help. And it let Kyrie go straight the fuck off. Lue might have the makings of a pick your poison situation here: who do you want to torch you? If Kerr has to stretch Iggy, then, even with Draymond, that\'s a problem for the Dubs. \n\n* Shumpert looking like trash all series. Both with his hair and his game. \n\n* The Dubs were really good tonight. Tons of their usual screen action, cutting, things we\'ve seen all season. But they held on the same way they did against OKC. By being able to sink stupid shots at a huge distance. Being that superior from beyond the arc is really mind boggling. Look. Not to say that the Cavs didn\'t help with that: it\'s an elimination game and people were slow to close out. That\'s losing basketball.  \n\n* Get better Bogut. \n\n* Refs get a B-/B for the first quarter. Half a grade docked for those Varejao flops, and another half for not calling a foul on that TT block on Klay.  \n\n* Y\'know what? I *almost* wish Golden State had taken us up on Harden for Thompson. Dude fits the OKC profile to a T: long, athletic and smart. The offense is a fucking bonus. Plus imagine Curry having been forced to learn to defend, playing next to Harden. \n\n* Andre Igoudala deserves to get seriously paid. Also on that list are Harrison Barnes, (probably) Speights and definitely Livingston. I want to see them get paid, not only because it would break up this unholy alliance of a bench, but also because, these guys deserve it. \n\n* Steph was relatively quiet again tonight. Not to say that he was a non factor (whattup K.Love), but the defense definitely took him out of his rhythm tonight. Once again, no disrespect, but its another series where Klay has done most of the heavy lifting. King Waffle Cone is gonna snap out of it eventually though. He always seems to. \n\n* Cavs uniforms tonight looked awful. Black with a big C. Really? Those uniforms are the closest thing to the physical embodiment of a double dribble. \n\n* Anderson Varejao is a ho. I honestly didn\'t like him jumping from one 1-seed to another, but to then flop like a flaccid dick in oversized boxers is extra. And then he goes to the line and misses the free throws? Pick a struggle you toilet brush shaped bastard.\n\n* Kyrie\'s development is the Cavs\' future. Honestly, I think that Kyrie\'s shown flashes of something truly special this postseason. It\'s gonna be great watching this kid grow. His jumper was beautiful, he passed into the pocket a couple of times, and, most importantly, he didn\'t sleep on defense. Dude absolutely blacked out, and what\'s worse he made it look effortless. The crazy thing is, that he did it against Klay and company. Draymond isn\'t his primary defender, so, assuming Draymond\'s softer defensive skills (i.e. communication) are equally neutralized by LeBron\'s IQ, then this might be repeatable.\n\n* UnderArmour still makes trash looking shoes. I don\'t care how long your commercials are, or how advanced your metrics, or technological advancements are. The Curry 2s are everything Twitter said they are. You spectactularly lucky sonsofbitches lucked into the most marketable, and singularly popular player since rookie LeBron. And you give him the most Payless looking shoes in the boundlessness of infinite possibility. Those shoes smell like Bass Pro Shops and "All Lives Matter". If Seth is smart, he\'ll take his free agent ass to Nike. \n\nAight, that\'s the analysis. I\'m gonna speak briefly about the LeBron v Draymond clusterfuck that\'s been going on the past few days. This sub has been packed with tweets from no-name writers, washed up ex players, and a bunch of no-flair, dry dick precum babies with nothing better to do. \n\n* I honestly do not care if LeBron got called a bitch. It\'s a grown man\'s league. Shit gets said all the time. LeBron, unfortunately, is too iconic for his own good. He can\'t say shit about it. \n\n* That being said, this contingent of people who seemingly are okay with calling people, and being called a bitch, is really confusing to me. Couple things on that note: there are quite possibly less than a dozen people on the continent who would legitimately run up on LeBron talking shit. Don\'t act crazy, people. \n\n* My flair says everything you need to know about my honest feelings on Draymond. I like his game, but this man has touched more NBA penis in the past month and a half than most groupies. In fact, he got suspended because his last flagrant was literally an egregious and unnecessary touching of another man\'s meat. \n\n* LeBron has the right to not be called out of his name. And that\'s legitimate. But calling him sensitive is probably the most backasswards sentiment I\'ve seen this playoffs since "OKC should double Aldridge", and "Golden State is trash without Steph".\n \n * Sensistive is Klay\'s daddy having an opinion. And what\'s worse is it being a dumbass opinion. The greatest physical specimen in modern sports wouldn\'t be able to handle the physicality of the league? Coming from Mychal "I couldn\'t catch a Magic Johnson pass" Thompson? Aight. There\'s a reason Dell kept his damn mouth shut. \n\n * Steph is no better in my book. IDC how bad your wife is (straight fire), she doesn\'t get to subtweet like a jaded ex. Ayesha Curry probably picks fights with dudes built like Karl Malone and then says shit like "my man\'s gonna whoop your ass". Come get your wife the fuckouttahere. \n\n Had to get that out. Sorry. \n\nSeries isn\'t over until someone wins 4 games. Obviously. And, now, much like GS in Game 6 in the WCF, the Cavs are going back home, riding a high off a road win, and with plenty of positive momentum in both Kyrie\'s performance, and LeBron\'s revitalized shooting. The officiating was crisp, clean, and surprisingly balanced. Don\'t count either team out. Don\'t overreact. Just enjoy the next game. It\'s shaping up to a be a gorgeous one. |Raptors|-2
I said it before the game, here's to welcoming most of this sub back to our side!  |Cavaliers|-2
uh.... idk about that||0
Then you don't know this sub.|Cavaliers|0
Congratulations on rigging the series u/nba ban curry and klay for game  6 to make sure we have a game 7!||-8
Yup cause ball tapping someone for the 3rd time this playoff is totally a basketball move \n\nEdit: down vote me all you want. There is no reason to ball tap another player in basketball |Cavaliers|4
If it takes manipulating the league office into handing out a bullshit suspension and having Lebron and Irving combine for 80+ points in order to win, I think GSW should feel just fine heading into Cleveland. \n\nJust waiting for "Draymond Green suspended for saying mean things behind Silver\'s back". \n\nWas generally ambivalent before, but seriously fuck Adam Silver. Hope the Warriors take it in Cleveland. ||-2
On the one hand, it's sad the Cavs had to manipulate the league office to get an unfair advantage (and it's insane that that's even possible). On the other hand, the Warriors' shooting and defense were total garbage in the second half. I have no doubt this game would have played out much differently had Green been on the floor.\n\nI guess the silver lining is that the Warriors will be able to bring another championship to Cleveland in game 6.|Warriors|-5
Manipulate the league office, really dude? Draymond could've been suspended multiple times throughout these playoffs once he was close to the flagrant points. |[HOU] James Harden|2
There wasn't a flagrant call on the floor. There were many reports of the Cavs front office pressuring the league office into upgrading the foul, and they got what they wanted. It's definitely on Draymond to not give anyone the opportunity to suspend him, but the upgraded call barely made sense and the suspension honestly ruins the integrity of the series. Unless something truly egregious happens, they need to let the players play.|Warriors|0
There have been multiple flagrant calls this playoffs that have been called one after the game have ended. Draymond Green has 3 of them by himself.|[HOU] James Harden|2
Let's not forget that prior to the Warriors magical championship run last season, their team would fall apart in the postseason once Bogut got injured.  Which could be counted on to happen.  It just took a little longer to happen this season.||-4
Just came here to say I hate Doris Burke. I can't stand that heifer and the way she speaks. I'd so much rather listen/watch a sports announcer who actually has a clue about the game ask questions of players and make commentary instead of this wench. Muted every part when she came on. She makes me wanna punch stuff. \n\nEdit: down vote all you want. I'd rather listen to Sir Charles ramble on about how trrble something is than listen to Doris Burke ask scripted questions. ||-7
Doris is a fucking saint.|Heat|1
You dont know what youre talking about|Heat|2
How so?\n||1
Well first of all her looks are irrelevant.  Second of all she has a clue about the game, she played college basketball, which is probably more than you have done.  If you check her wikipedia you will see here basketball accomplishments.  Third of all she is a very decent analyst, if you ever get the opportunity to watch a game she is calling.  |Heat|1
If you'll re-read my comment, it had nothing to do with her looks. Her speech pattern and unnatural pauses drive me nuts. I don't care for her at all and I'm entitled to my opinion the same as you. And no I didn't play college ball. I was a little busy with some other issues while in the service. ||1
you called her a heifer.  Now in addition to being wrong you are also in denial.  |Heat|1
you called her a heifer.  Now in addition to being wrong you are also in denial.  |Heat|1
So kyrie has the best game of his career, Lebron does way better than he normally does, and the refs sucked the cavs dick all night following a draymond suspension? Sure the cavs played great but it smells f 2002. I conceded the Warriors played very middling but this game was hard to watch with those few momentum changing calls.|Kings|-7
The game was terribly called but it was pretty evenly called. There was a lot of bullshit against the Cavs. The only real thing I saw in favor of the Cavs was after Lebron got a few blocks, the refs gave him the benefit of the doubt after every attempted block and let him hack dudes on a couple plays.||2
Like when the refs gave the Warriors the ball for Kyrie dribbling the ball "out of bounds"? Gtfo |Heat|3
That Klay foul? That was some dog shit|Kings|1
