That last minute of game time was the saddest I've witnessed. I'm pretty sure Milhouse's dad on The Simpsons tried harder to save his marriage than the Cavs did to win the game.
Hello darkness my old friend
LeBron: "I sleep in a Kia k900 do youuu?"\n\n\nCurry: "I sleep in a big bed with my 2015 & 2016 Larry O\'Brien Trophies"
This [fan](http://i.imgur.com/sY4D42o.gifv) shares your sentiment.
that was some LeBron and Kyrie stat padding in the end
Did they legitimately take ONE three in the last 90 seconds of game time? I don't remember one. Just let LBJ drive to the hole for a layup, using 15-20 seconds every time, matched by Steph or Klay hitting free throws...it's just pure stat padding. So confusing. So disheartening for Cavs fans, I'd think. 
but jacking up threes was their ONLY hope then. just going to the hoop is suicidal.
There is 0% chance the cavs win by going for layups down 9 with 40 seconds to go when they are trading pts with two good FT shooters on GS. Jacking up 3s would've at least have given them a chance to catch up instead of simply treading water.
Regardless of them not making 3s all game you have to go for 3s down 9 with under a minute to play if you want a chance to win it. If you keep trading 2s with the other team you might as well just dribble out the game instead because all you're doing is stat padding at that point.
No, LeBron immediately drove - the only way what you are saying is true is if the only person the Cavs wanted to take a 3 was LeBron. Which, I guess is true - but egregiously bad coaching and/or gameplay by LeBron. You can't trade layups for fouls against Curry and Thompson who are NOT going to miss at the line. #math 
LeBron literally waited for the defence to get to their formation before driving to the hoop. Like what the fuck? You don't even have a mid-range junper and you let the opponent get to their defensive formation?
And yet he wasn't driving at all earlier in the game when it might have actually helped. What the fuck. 
Yeah super weird. Like you have 2 nearly 90% free throw shooters how are you going to make up an 8 pt deficit by making layups? \n\nEdit free throw 
Lebron wants to know is he can borrow a feeling. 
Hurtin' hearts need some healing.
I can spare him a jar of Love.
He has enough of that. Do you have a jar of Wade maybe?
Lebron's heart needs some healing.
Take my hand with your Dubs of love!!!
Lebron now sleeps in a race car bed.
Steph Curry: I sleep in a big bed with my Larry Obrien trophies.

this is grand.
The Cleveland Cavaliers spent over 200 million U.S. Dollars on players last offseason just to watch Lebron James and Kyrie Irving iso for 12 minutes.
Should've spent it on an actual coach 
Yeah, that was ridiculous IMO.\n\n>Hey we're keeping this game close by moving the ball around and making smart plays, what should we do next?\n\n>I know! Let's make Lebron and Kyrie dribble for 10s at the top of the key.\n\nEveryone that said Lue is a better coach than Blatt looks like an absolute fool now.
Who the fuck did? Even if they dominated their division, my view hasn't changed. Blatt is by far a better coach. Lue has no head coaching experience, compared to Blatt. CLE management really needa to go. So bad.
>Who the fuck did?\n\nYou're joking right? You could find tons of comments with hundreds of upvotes about this exact thing when Lue was winning 10 playoff games in a row. Some people were unconvinced and still saying that Blatt did just as well in the playoffs, but that was not even the majority opinion.
he wasn't playing though. it's the responsibility of the players to trust each other
Exact same thing could be said about Blatt.
Lue literally said during the game he wants to see more ball movement.
Which led to...
Lebron is the coach.
Well, when you dribble, you move the ball up and down.
I don't think Lue wanted that, he was ragging on them earlier for not moving it. Kyrie and LeBron just developed tunnel vision
I'm a Blatt fan, and prefer him to Lue for the most part. But I think the iso's are Lebron and Kyrie's doings. They're just playing hero ball and downright ignoring the offensive schemes
That's exactly what Westbrook and KD did down the stretch and that killed their momentum
Makes you wonder what the warriors are doing to encourage that sort of play, or if both the Cavs and Thunder just start fucking up toward the end of big games. 
I don't understand it... Why was Tristan Thompson on the bench when he was manhandling us? Why the hell was Channing Frye in that early? What the hell were the refs doing during the game? Was Lue paid to watch 2 players play iso? I'll take the win, no lie, but wth was going on.
0-5 FTs, easy hack target. I would still roll with Thompson after seeing Frye play though, he's not getting open at all.
Yeah, but with 2 minutes left, he needs to be on the floor. And even if it's hack-a-Thompson, in a physical game, they sacrificed their rebounding advantage for... Frye? So that they could just play iso and not give Frye the ball?
Yea but honestly the only reason GS got going was all the fucking rebounds. The Cavs control the tempo when TT is in cause the dude dominates the shit out of the middle.\n
The rebounds are what changed the game IMO. It was a close game, and they put up a stat about TT beasting on the boards. GSW started getting tons of second and third chances though and that just blew the game up. (relatively speaking of course, it was still close at the time.)
but most of those came off of Love with TT on the bench
Seriously their offense is so lazy I can't believe how they literally go five or more possessions in a row with iso ball just to jack up a three or long contested shot. Not even just Kyrie and his blackhole ballstopping ass, or LeBron's awful J, but when they go into iso mode everybody else literally just stands there and before you know it the shot clock is at 5 and nobody has moved. God forbid they set screens for each other or make any movement off the ball. It's just like the Thunder in games 5-7 except the Cavs run the clock all the way down before chucking where as the Thunder just ran up the court and chucked. 
And they let go David Blatt who's a offensive genius, scrap his offense before they even gave a fair try. 
Coaches are hamstrung by Lebron. He won't allow more complicated offenses that don't include him in an ISO.
I think Spoelstra was pretty damn good.
I don't really think Lebron is the problem.\n\nKyrie ADMITS to getting lost on defense. I am sure he probably gets lost on offense and doesn't admit it. Love isn't very athletic to begin with. Shump is a defensive specialist, basically. I have no comment on J.R. Because he's really random.\n\nBasically, I don't think half the Cavs player can play in complicated offense, but Lebron definitely can. Lebron's really damn smart and has great court vision. And anyone who wants to argue just look at the Miami years.\n\nThe difference is Bosh, Wade, Allen, Battier are all smart players (and capable defenders).
? Heat played a really nice offense 
Spo's a better coach. Shame we didn't get  to see much of Blatt's play design. I remember break downs of his euro stuff was pretty.
Yeah cavs need to get into offense much quicker. \n\nI'm not sure why LeBron uses screens just solely to get a mismatch. He can drive on any of GSW with out having a mismatch. And if he does get a mismatch why not get it while attacking the screen? \n\nWhy can't cavs get LeBron a post up anywhere close to the basket? Warriors post up Barnes and Thompson closer than Cavs post LBJ. 
Are you honestly fucking kidding me? Wtf are you taking about. Before tonight he was leading the series in points rebounds assists and minutes pergame. Yah just some haggard old man. You just hate on lebron because he has shat all over your team for the last decade
Idk, I'm not sure if I saw a single post up at all during game 4. \n\nI don't get how pro coaches are so bad at coaching and utilizing him and his size/strengths. 
Novice here, whats iso?
Isolation. When a player calls for his teammates to space out the floor and allow his defender to take him 1 on 1 and basically just sit there and in this case just dribble.
Benefits of iso ball:\n\n* On rare occasions a player is good enough to steamroll an entire team for a game, maybe for two games. If they're truly great, they might win a few series this way (see LeBron's previous amazing series here and there, ie 25 pts in a row against Detroit https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Px-jPm_TU). But rarely a series.\n* Ummm can't think of any others. Big star gets big stats? Some highlight reel material?\n\nDisadvantages of iso ball:\n\n* No team chemistry, no flow, weakened morale on the court\n* Fewer offensive rebounds\n* Opponents get to rest on defense\n* Opponents don't have to adjust or adapt or deal with surprises 
Also, and maybe this is an obvious pro/con, but it gives the other 8 players on the court a bit of a rest. \n\nIf an offense runs a ton of isos, it's less tiring over the course of the game (assuming the isos are spread out amongst players) as they don't have to expend energy setting or coming off screens, making cuts, etc. And of course, this also is less tiring for the defense, who won't have to spend energy fighting through screens/switching/chasing backdoor cuts. \n\nAnother pro of an iso play is that it lets you easily attack a player who is in foul trouble -- the Cavs actually did this to Klay Thompson last night late in the 2nd quarter (Klay had 2 fouls). 
one more potential pro: it slows the game waaay down and limits fast break opportunities for the opposing team (e.g. last year's finals)
Less turnovers as well
So the advantage of isolation plays is when you think you have a mismatch.  If you think your guy can take their guy every single time, it makes sense to run an isolation play.  Typically LeBron is a good bet to win these matchups, so it makes some sense.  
Except if the other team sees that's all you do it's easy to play help defense since a lot times they are unlikely to pass (***looking at Irving, PG w 28 shots vs 4 assists)
kyrie runs full speed straight at the basket again

Kids in Africa are gonna think LeBron has the most rings ever by the end of his career.
FIVE TIME FIVE TIME FIVE TIME Champion...to the children of Africa
Messed up, but true 
To them MJ is trash, ain't got no shirts of the bulls, but Lebron? They have a shirt for nearly every day of the week
Lebron James and the Buffalo Bills are the greatest dynasties ever in Africa
What's the reference? I'm rather new.
Professional sports usually print enough t shirts for both teams competing in the championship game/series, which explains why the SECOND a team wins a Super Bowl, the NBA Finals, or the World Series etc., the winning team is all wearing hats and shirts that says the year and "world champions" or something.  \n  \nI\'ll give you one guess as to what happens to the shirts made for the teams that obviously don\'t get championship t shirts each year. 
Since nobody knows who is gonna win the play offs finals both teams camps manufacturers the winning t-shirts, hoodies and accessories which is intended to be worn after and during the last game of the play offs finals so that they can show support and celebrate.\n\nThe losing teams clothing gets sent out to africa and other third world countries  and since Lebron James has been in 7 finals and only won 2 (so far) the kids in africa who recieves the clothes will think that he keeps winning them.
That's kind of clever, thanks for explaining.

What do you mean the buffalo bills and Lebron aren\'t the greatest part about American sports?

They never thought they would see a dynasty like the 80s Bills again.

Lebron is going to be the Bill Russell of Africa
lol you're insinuating they even made the shirts this year. 
Holy fuck he's broken already

Of course they did. If they didn't, they'd have to send something of equal value to Africa, like Kevin Love.

It's a long flight, he'll get injured before he gets there
Just when you thought the comments couldn't be any more savage 
Good god the savagry
African Children ask if teams can beat the 95-96 Sonics
So I guess in the finals of big sports (NFL, NBA, etc.) they make Champions shirts for each team so that the players of the winning team can quickly put em on right after the game ends, and the shirts of the team that didn't win supposedly get sent to Africa/other 3rd world countries as donations 
If you make it to the championship in a sport they make shirts right away saying you won to sell. If you lose they donate it somewhere like Africa. LeBron loses a lot in the finals
This is a new level

It's all about getting one taco for the land of the free
Canada has taco bell and freedom.\n\nand free healthcare. checkmate.
Idc who wins. I just wanted free tacos. FINALLY! 
Good guy Lebron doing his this for the poor people in cleveland
From Portugal and we dont have Taco Bell so i guess i will make me a Taco just to feel like i belong :(
Getting free tacos for the land
Why is the free taco on the 21st? I guess they expect everyone to forget by then.
from 2-6pm too. cuz no one is at work then 
it's a $1.39 taco lmao.
Free is free. 
RemindMe! 10 days "free taco somewhere"
It was after the finals so that they could schedule it on that day for sure, without worrying about what happens in the games.\n\n The odds that the home team wins every game is very low, it hasn't happened in 60 years or something crazy
Consolation prize for every team that lost to the Warriors. \n\nThanks Steph!
[Andrew Bynum enjoyed this one](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Ckoi84lUoAENELr.jpg:large)
wait is this real?
https://twitter.com/ChatSports/status/741443546247516160
I can't believe he just disappeared off the map. I honestly hope he saved most of his money. He really doesn't owe us or the league anything in my opinion. Would be pretty cool if he has enough money to just chill the rest of his life. He was extremely lucky with this career but he achieved a lot either way.
It sounded like from just whispers around the league, from people that knew him, that Bynum never really loved the game. Sounds like it was just one of those things, people saw the type of body he was growing up into as a kid, told him he should play basketball, so he did and found success, but he never really had a passion for it himself. But hey, are you gonna turn down a bright future and potentially tons of money in the future? Probably not. But seems like once he got it, after a while, that lack of passion was just too strong.
I mean he struggled with his knees like his whole life as well. Having the first of many knee surgeries at like 12 years old and continuing to battle with that would suck. Combine that with possibly not loving the game that much and quitting after a couple rings and like 70 mil would probs be pretty appealing.
He was arguably the best center in the league at one point! I mean look at this [footwork and the moves!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPhM1Y8EUdw)
Haven't seen anyone really comment on it, but those minutes when Varejao played were great. He played with a great sense of urgency 
Honestly his minutes in the 3rd felt like the turning point of the game to me. The Dubs had been playing from behind, and personally I didn't really get the sense that they were confident. Usually when watching the Warriors, no lead really feels safe, but the Cavs lead felt safe to me. Then Varejao came in there and really seemed to spark them. He played like he wanted that ring. No way he wants to see Cleveland finally win a ring the same year they cut him after 12 years, AND have it be won against his current team. I'd be balling my ass off too in that situation.
He good guy mang.
For someone who gets a ring either way, he played his heart out today. 
He knows the Warriors rings will be massive compared to a Cavs ring
Honestly though. I can't imagine he would view the Cavs ring with any sense of pride at all. To me personally it wouldn't have much value at all. Not even a fraction that it would have if I actually won. 
When you\'re in the finals playing against the team that traded you, you don\'t want the biggest trophy of your career to be "lol remember when you got beat by the team that didn\'t want you anymore?" Everyone would rather win a ring by actually contributing to that team.
Who wouldn't want to beat the team that felt you weren't worth keeping
While the sentiment is understandable, even Varejao couldn't argue he was worth keeping with a straight face. The Warriors signed him for some Cleveland insider stories and for 6 finals fouls a game if needed.
He's also got a pretty good basketball iq, exactly the type of guy the warriors like for their bench
And the home crowd boo'd you the last game 
He played 12!?!?!?! years for Cavs and they traded him to save money, he was pissed and now they are booing him. I just cant believe how dumb some fans can be.
Everyone I know was upset about the trade. Then when he got on the warriors everyone was upset about him. Calling it a betrayel and shit. We traded him. He took his best option. People are so fucking dumb.
Cleveland in accounting don't give a fuck.
Idk what it is about Steph, but it seems like he pisses LeBron off way more than any other superstar in the league. LeBron is known for being buddy buddy with a lot of the league, but for some reason Steph really seems to irk him.
I think it\'s about Steph stealing his spot light. Taking consecutive MVP\'s. Everyone saying Steph is the best. Even after a Finals game where he scored 2 points in the half, he\'s still "better" than LeBron.
Steph doesn't go to clubs, curse,very regilious and seems to be a doting husband. He's really a dweeb probably in lebrons eyes.
Steph stole the spotlight. Simple as that, really. 
I fired coach blatt because of you!!!!
It's not about Steph pissing off Lebron; it's about Lebron being down 1-2 in the Finals against one of the most dominant teams in NBA history
It's cause Curry is tiny
I noticed this as well! Curry took Lebron's crown, right when Lebron was poised to make his redemption tour. 
Well I think part of the problem is lebrons grasp on the crown has always been tenuous as fuck.\n\nFirst he comes in the league as king James.\n\nHe develops a bit but jumps on the scene in 07 poised to be a finals mainstay for years to come.\n\nBut that gets interrupted by his team sucking and Kobe reclaiming he top spot.\n\nThen as Kobe finally fades and lebron is back in the finals everyone is washing it off as wades team, needing help, taking my talents to victory parades.\n\nThen lebrons ready to correct all that by winning it for the land and here comes steph and were ready to not only bash lebron the player, but now also lebron the GM/coach.\n\nSo I don\'t think it\'s anything particular about steph as much as culmination of a decade of "what do I have to do?!?!"
It's because he knows that curry dethroned him. and he's salty as fuck
Steph is the darling of the media now, and his team isn't going to let Lebron win another ring - at least not with this iteration of this team.  Lebron is probably just having a hard time coming to grips with fate
Because no other star in the league has been a threat to his global icon status like this before.  Steph is taking his MVP's, Steph is taking his titles, Steph can do no wrong with the media.  Besides the ghosts that Lebron is chasing, Steph is the first star that is actually rivaling him on the court and taking his spotlight.
Also, like it or not, steph curry actually looks like a human being, whereas lebron does not.
what does that even mean?
He's a skinny kid, LeBron is a beast. Easier to relate to.\n\n
It's like the Messi vs Ronaldo debate. Messi is more relatable because he is a 5 foot 7 average looking dude where Ronaldo looks like a Greek god.
I chose Greek god because they are portrayed as superhuman beings with perfect physique.
He's butthurt that Curry is ruining his Cleveland Redemption Plan. 
:)
In Curry's defense, LeBron just wanted to win one for the Land.  He never specified *which* land.
I don't know how this joke is still getting upvotes, y'all have beaten this poor line to death and then some.
Welcome to /r/NBA, home of crying Jordan faces, big if true, and savages. We're pretty much /r/blackpeopletwitter with basketball references.
To be fair, We call Oakland the "Town"\nOakTown
I know....PortLAND

Curry won one for the (oak)land already
OakLand?
Well he also wanted to win 7(?) for Miami so there's that too 
He wanted to lose 7, we all just assumed he meant win. 
The Land of the Free and Home of the Brave  have won every single NBA finals
USA - 69, Canada - 0 
it's really wild to look back at the ncaa run that steph had and see lebron in the stands enjoying it. 
I wonder if LeBron heard a prophecy about the one who would come after him and take his crown, and in his fear, LeBron went to see the young man that was prophesized, got one look at Steph and decided not to worry. I bet he wishes he'd killed Steph when he had the chance. \n\nSorry, been reading lots of GoT fan theories lately...
LeBron is King Herod now?
That's what happens when someone smaller, younger, and less athletic than you takes your crown AND throne. And then makes you dance for his amusement.
Also the fact that Curry just doesn't care about any adversity. He isn't phased and doesn't let the emotions of the game take over. Kobe said it best in that he really plays in the moment.
whos dancing now lol
Oh for sure man
Smaller, younger, less athletic, better looking, better friends with Drake, the list goes on
Did you just describe Joffrey
Just like many of of the old retired stars like Barkley, these guys are watching the NBA transform into a different style of play in front of their very eyes and the new face of the league is so different than the guys they grew up worshipping.... guys who could fly above the rim or dominate the paint. They don't know how to react. So they're pissed.
This is a REALLY good way to describe it 
You're right Lebron sill has his crown as evidenced by him winning mvp the last two years and winning both finals.
So Duncan's the king?
Can robots be king?
Yep. Lebron is clearly the king. Mvp two years in a row.
Game 2 he had 18 points on 7/11 4/8 3P and 9 rebounds in 24 mins.... That's embarrassing?
How did LeBron outplay Curry this game? 
> Except for this game\n\n
Sorry the NBA is a team game?  And Sorry people like Curry more?  People know James is good,  they just like watching Curry shoot, stop being offended. 
And handle the ball. People always underrate his ball handling skills. Sometimes it feels like he\'s got it on a string. But to go back to the above dudes tirade, I think Steph has more fans because the guy just seems more relatable and likable. LeBron always wanted to be liked and it came off as a weird sort of political pandering. People like Steph because he wasn\'t crowned the day he showed up. He worked from the shadows for awhile, got better better before our eyes but always stayed the same dude it seemed. LeBron tried to have it all. He wanted to leave Cleveland and not be hated. That\'s how you get shit like "The Decision" and then jerseys burning in the streets. I had more to include, but now I can\'t remember and I\'m tired...
I thoroughly enjoy watching Lebrons signature drive to the basket while arm barring for a layup/dunk. It's so thrilling! /s 
https://imgflip.com/i/15o9l6
GOOD POINT
when the king turns into the jester
Bang
This Warriors team and Steph is the first time LeBron hasn't been the driving narrative in the NBA since he became the best player. Its the first time his face of the league status has been legitimately threatened. I think a lot of superstars around the league feel threatened or tired of Curry being the golden boy and becoming a sports phenomenon.
I don't think Lebron has been the driving narrative in the NBA except for his villain turns. If you ask anyone who doesn't follow the NBA about LeBron chances are all they'll know about is him being good and the decision. If anything he should be glad Draymond Green came along and took away his most hated man in ball title. 
Because he's really, really good.
Also he seems to be allowed to nut shot guys with impunity. 
Because he likes to karate people in the balls 
I don't know if it's as personal as that. Couldn't it just be Lebron wants to win, and the Warriors making his team look like chumps is frustrating to him?
Especially being a shooter. Golden state is changing the way NBA ball is played. 
Tristan Thompson on the bench in the clutch that was Lue's basketball crime
People said this sub overreacted after game 2 but now we see why it wasn't. A rookie coach has very low chances of beating an all-time great team at oracle two times in a row.
I don't know how many games it will take Cleveland to beat the Warriors 3 times but it sure as shit isn't 3. 
Offensive rebounds? Pfft don\'t need em
Except the guy couldnt hit a free throw to save his life this game. 
He was a free throw liability 
Some people don't want to admit GS is just better. Lue has no options.
The issue with the Cav bench is that for everything they do well, there is something they do horribly.  You have to pick and choose which liability you are willing to live with at that time.  GS doesn't have that much of a problem.  And depending on certain lineups their opponents put on the floor, their Bench matchups might be even *better* than their first 5.
Completely destroyed their rebounding advantage
Thompson was balling so fucking hard. It's a travesty he was off of the floor for so long.
As a Warrior fan, I am literally fearing TT more than Lebron this series.
I think kerr would have started hacking him, but still. Shouldve been out there
I meant before that. He sat for a while 
Yep. He was something like 0/5 from the line if I remember right. 
Yea..... gotta at least make 50% come on TT
I guess Lue wanted more 3s from Frye. Too bad they were 1-9 in the second half.
He didn't shoot whole game, so why he even expected points from Frye? TT was on fire and when camera shown his face at the end of game  I saw his dissapointment
Dude blew assignment after assignment, wtf was he doing on the floor in crunch time 
There's a reason the Suns declined to re-sign him at that price - he's a very streaky shooter and his defense and rebounding is just plain bad.\n\nPeople laughed and acted like we didn't know what we were giving up but anyone who watched the Suns enough knew already - he's a turnstile.
I know, everyone has been talking about Love's defense, but damn Frye's was bad. He seemed to have no idea what the defensive gameplan was.
Frye makes Love look like Bill Russell defensively
I guess he was there to shoot 3's except Lue forgot he had to actually draw up a play for that to happen
It was like a kid playing NBA 2K. Spends most of clock trying to force into the paint with LeBron and if that doesn't work outlet pass to chuck contested 3. They almost always pick Cavaliers too.

It went from...\n\n1. Kevin Love has never lost a playoff game.\n2. Kevin Love has never lost a playoff game in America (loss @Toronto)\n3. Kevin Love has never lost a playoff game in Cleveland (loss @ GS)\n4. Kevin Love has never lost a playoff game in Cleveland when in the starting lineup. (Today's loss)
Kevin Love has never lost a game at YMCA between 2 and 3

The trashing of the \xe2\x80\x9cChef\xe2\x80\x9d Shoes has awakened the MVP from his slumber.

He's had two bad finals games. Stop giving him excuses.
Oh and Kevin Love and Kyrie Irving--who 538 and everyone else--said was a championship triumvirate. No rewriting history now...
I would hate to coach or play with Lebron. Sure he's one of the greatest but if you win, he gets all the credit and if you lose, you get all the blame. Hell even if you do win, he just gets the credit for carrying your ass. 
Yeah but even then, it's essentially insinuating that the team sucks. He's just getting shit on for not building a good enough team. 
I mean, Kyrie is pretty damn good...
After closely watching this Cavs playoff run, I would honestly hate having Kyrie as my starting point guard. Especially for how much they are paying him. 
He ain't D-Wade though. 
Nevermind Wade's age dude. Kyrie will never touch prime Wade
My friend was adamant that Kyrie will have a better career than Wade. Lol
That shouldn't be a knock against Kyrie though, it's a select class that can come close to prime Wade
https://imgur.com/bTM9xeQ
https://imgur.com/83vLQb4
Perfect. 
D-Wade is.
...barely.
He ain't some scrub either. If LeBron needs a player of Wade's caliber to win that's sad.
I agree. It kind of takes away from Lebron if he needs Wade to win. This Cavs team has a good supporting cast.
Nah man, you don't see it do you?\n\n\n. \n \n. \n\n. \n\n. \n\n. \n\n\n\nHe needs Chalmers. 
I mean 34 points on 50% shooting isn't exactly garbage level...
But his defense isn't even remotely close to Wade. Same for Bosh vs Love. 
That gonna be the excuse this year? I swear man watch Lebron lose the finals next year again with Miami and Lebron fanboys will say "well d-wade is too old now"
Kyries kinda like james harden without the passing
I also think Hardens a much better scorer.
Amazing, kyrie pretty much outplayed him today, and this will be the narrative
kyrie scored more, he didn't outplay bron. kyrie had his own harden-esque montage of blown assignments after a commercial break.
Kyrie had some great defensive stops but he was an overall negative\n\nHowever, I'm of the opinion that lebrons constant lane jumping for steals is a detriment, especially when the Warriors aren't turning it over like retards, as in game 3
Excuses again. TT and Kyrie balled tonight.
I think Kyrie scored 2 points in the 4th quarter. His potential is obvious and he has a world of talent, but he's not the finished product yet. 
He is still a very good player. To imply Lebron doesn't have a supporting cast is deeply misguided.
They aren't deeper than Golden State, maybe every other team but not Golden State so it's not fair for them.  /s
And that's when LeBron should have taken over. Teams look to their leader to get them to the finish line. The supporting cast did their job for the first 3 quarters and kept the game close while LeBron was being extremely passive when he had key opportunities to score. This was a let-down game from LeBron.

Whoa. Plot twist. 
it might go unnoticed because of the splash bros heroics, but Barnes had a really good game today
His offense was money, but kinda spacey on defense. It's funny cause its usually the other way around.
He's been quietly really good this series. Hitting open shots, getting boards, not trying to do too much.

The series isn't over yet. If Lebron loses, I will admit my mistake and get the tattoo, man. But let the series actually play out. 
Takes a big man to show up to one of these. I'll upvote you just for showing up. 
Unfortunately my client u/_bluberries_ has explosive diarrhea from eating his own words. We ask that you respect his privacy in this sensitive time. 
Oh this thread is fucking gold right now!

oh little blueberry buddy. your comment history shows a new level of delusion. Dont get this tattoo though. its not worth it to get internet strangers to respect you. But also, stop writing checks with your mouth that your ass cant cash.
And doesn't have to
Yeah, don't be even more of an idiot /u/_bluberries_ -- just take this as a lesson to stop running your mouth.
I mean, no matter what faith you have, don't swear to be tattooed over a bet...and I have 15 tattoos...
>I am still sure that Cavs are winning this year.\n\nBut, like, why? 
I just have a good feeling about this. Lebron will step up. Anyway, let's talk after the series is over because I feel every discussion is presumptuous at this point. 
Lebron has had 4 chances to step up this series and he's done it 1.5 times.
4.5 times*
Because he's fucking rain man that's why
Lol, looks like you're the idiot now.
He been gone for 2 days. Deep in his heart he knew what Game 4 would entail.
hindsight sure is a motherfucker huh
Rekt.  Simply rekt.
How can OP be that confident in LeBron when the cavs are facing a team that lost only 9 games in the regular season? 
because once golden shite werriors start shooting bricks, they lost. And he's right to have faith on bron after today 
Because LeBron is the greatest player of the last 17 years and some average point guard who is insanely fire from 3 does not change that
upvote this man, where you at u/_bluberries_
Welp after this series he's getting a new username lol 
Eh, I am not a coward. I will keep my word if Lebron loses this year, as I have said. 
Does the community get to vote on what tattoo you get?
No, it doesn't look like the community gets to vote on what tattoo to get.  Cos, you know.......
I vote dick butt with a LeBron jersey
i've said it before and i'll say it again: you a real one
What tattoo should he get? "2/7"?
maybe u/_bluberries_ could just get a big EASTERN CONFERENCE logo somewhere. 1. cause they suck, 2. cause he's a lol spurs fan

Curry might win the Finals in those shoes just to troll everyone

better yet, wear his regular sneakers, and after his first miss, call timeout, change shoes, and then [give this look to the camera](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-OGrMmq7yT0U/US52Us1pRXI/AAAAAAAAGng/qRzYeX9EG0U/s640/Stephen+Curry+Soon.jpg) \n\n*edit* thought of an even better idea, instead of a gatorade dunk, curry just empties a bunch of the shoes on kerr

Dude in the the glasses kept screaming "fuck you!" and pointing to Livingston and Curry. They should look to Westbrook for guidance. 
The fat kid was triggering me so hard early on

Guess Curry heard us saying that he's not playing like an MVP. Also, idk what practice Windhorst was at.
Windhorst (kind of) threw some shade at Curry's performance during today's practice saying he was *terrible* & that everything was just off.
As Windhorst comes home to a microwaved 4th meal and slams down some Cheetos. *Windhorst sighs* 
Windhorst said he saw Curry practice & that he just looked terrible throughout that instance and also stated that everything just looked off about him. ([Link](http://espn.go.com/video/clip?id=espn:16101819))
I mean even in the game Livingston went off, Draymond was the best defensive player on the floor (40 minutes played) while being 3ast away from a triple double (16pts, 11reb, 7ast).\n\nLivingston really was amazing in that game though so yeah, he brought the momentum & was efficient as hell.
wtf he scored 38? so quietly too. it amazes me that he can score almost 40 and i don't even really notice it happening
He had a good amount of sly layups throughout the game & hit some nice 3s in the clutch. \n\nCombine his quick cuts to the lane, 10 FTA & legendary 3PT shot, then 38 points is easy money.\n\nAlso props to his squad for having the ball flow around constantly to keep Cavs defense on its toes, allowed Curry to sneak & push a ton.
he missed so many freebies too. 
Who gets MVP in this series? That's what I'm wondering now. Can you just give it to the team?
I kinda want Green to win FMVP just to see this sub burn.
Unless Curry goes for 40, I think Draymond has it in the bag.
If it's a close game again on monday and Curry leads the way to a win then I can see it happening.
In his hopes and dreams
Vince and T Mac said him shooting bad in practice was a sign he was going to have a great game
If you heard their drawn out explanation and not my summary then it might make more sense.  These are two guys who played the game at the highest level.  I trust their experience over your skepticism.  And they were right...
I honestly thought TMac and VC were full of shit when they said that... But they were right. 
yeah its possible over-confidence with the 3 is bad going into a game. Like Klay was stepping up and taking 30 footers when he was starting 0-5 in the last game. It's way better when Curry and Klay get hot with natural shots before taking crazy ones.
Crazy to think that those 11 missed free throws could have changed the game completely. The Cavs just looked defeated even when they were still within reach.
They were tired. I hate this dialogue around the lack of drive. I think the Cavs are fucking gassed. They have to give 110% to match the Warriors at 90-100%. They can't do that for the whole game.
not to mention, they have to play insane minutes because they have no bench.
That stretch where they missed something like six in a row and went from up 2 to down 9 absolutely killed them. You can't let this Warriors team get that much momentum
Yeah man. Was really frustrated watching them give up that early. Congrats btw
Well Tristan and LeBron missed a lot of them. Good fouls by the Warriors.
Pressure is a crazy thing
Kevin Love missed consecutive free throws....wtf
Concussion.  
They looked gassed , the bench isn't contributing anything so it looks like they didn't have a lot left in the tank after game 3. It's a testament to warriors depth
Seriously, I feel like this goes unnoticed. Same thing with OKC, KD and Westbrook played unbelievable amounts of minutes and Kerr down 8-12 points would be resting Curry or Thompson with 9 minutes to go. Cavs had to play hard for 8 quarters to beat this team at home.
It's so nice to have a team that misses free throws after those jerks at OKC. 
Steven Adams turning into fucking Curry on the line in that series. smh
I'm sayin!!!
I recall seeing Steph/Klay miss more than I saw Adams miss at the line last series..
I don't get why they were shooting 2's towards the end when GSW FTs are borderline automatic 
Warriors knew what they were doin letting Lebron get those layups 
Yeah, I'd take FTs by Steph and Klay over 2 pt attempts by anybody, any day.
padding stats 
Padding stats.
LeBron seemed to just drive to the hole every possesion at the end. While he was able to score, those 2points dont really chip away since curry and thompson are almost guaranteed to hit their FTs.\n\nSo it can be seen as padding his stats, since making 2s is almost pointless because 3s, from my perspective, were their only chance of chipping away.
Yup. Lebron went from 18 to 25 points in garbage time.
exactly, lebrons 19 points look weak as fuck but 26 is at least respectable. pretty embarrassing for someone like lebron to do that though.
LeBron was clearly padding his stats at the end there, absolutely no reason to not be shooting 3's in that situation. 
Not really, he's padding his stats so when they lose the finals he will still have a good line, but He did try for an assist. Remember that long pass Curry stole at the end? 
ended up helping the Splash bros to pad their stats too.
I hate to think that about someone like Lebron, but it did look like he knew he'd be roasted all weekend if he ended with only 19 points. 
He remembers his statline from 2011 and got PTSD. Take out the win, and the fluffed 7 points from this game and his statline looks JUST like 2011.
I absolutely can. He plays like shit in losses this series and you absolutely cannot assume that his 6-7 points that came when the game required 3s meant anything since the Warriors were leaving the paint open. 
It's called standardizing the data and is used in statistics all the time
Great quote. Not even a passable argument though.
you can when someone is down 9 with under 2 minutes to play and taking layups 
Some snotty kid in the future is gonna look up this boxscore and say Lebron had a monster game.
You mean tomorrow?
The Cavs with the perfect OKC impression tonight. 4th Quarter? Fuck everything we have been doing up to this point and worked, and let's run that marvelous heroball.
http://i.imgur.com/VvVjens.jpg
This is exactly what happened, the parallels are so real - Kyrie and LeBron iso plays over and over just like Russ and KD. Something about these 4th quarters man.
It\'s because the Warriors simply don\'t go away and people get desperate while the Warriors go "... okay." and don\'t change a damn thing.
It's fatigue. Players don't have that same energy to do so many screens and move off the ball so often in the shot clock, especially when you gotta lock in so much on the other end. I believe Kyrie, JR, and LeBron all played more than 43 minutes, LeBron played 45.5. Also this is the only game in the series with only 1 day off. 
The Warriors have been the best team in close games by a large margin all year.  Partially because their depth allows the starters to rest, partially because they execute well.  Why is the narrative that there's some magic thing that makes other teams choke? It's good defense, having more energy, and clutch shooting ffs!
OKC actually won more than one game though.
There's probably some deep-seated trust issues on these teams. They don't think anyone will get it done but themselves. That's something that can't be bought/trained. The W's were shit and developed together, but look at their chemistry now.    \nEdit: Alright, I get it.  But deep-seeded almost makes sense in a metaphorical way (though seeds sown too deeply won\xe2\x80\x99t grow).
I think Jackson said it in one of the games, when they get stressed they start taking turns and it doesn't work. There was like 8 possessions in a row, Lebron would bring it up: iso. Kyrie would bring it up: iso and repeat. ZERO passing.
deep-seated
No it is not\n\n*"Deep-seeded almost makes sense in a metaphorical way (though seeds sown too deeply won\xe2\x80\x99t grow), but deep-seated is the term you\xe2\x80\x99re looking for"*\n\nhttp://grammarist.com/usage/deep-seeded-deep-seated/
I\'m no psychologist, but I think there\'s another explanation instead of it being a trust issue. Feeling the responsibility to play hero ball doesn\'t necessarily mean they don\'t trust their teammates.\n\n I think it more stems from watching their heros seemingly play hero ball and take over crucial games, and then doing it themselves on their own all the way up until they make the pros, and during regular season.  But what was really happening was just that they were so focused on their idols when they were young, that they didn\'t fully grasp the big picture of winning as a team.  For the most part, it does work for them, and they made it this far believing it.   Also during the course of an 82 game season, they have a lot of games to cover up when the hero ball doesn\'t work, so on average, it has worked in the pros too (remember, pro athletes have to be able to forget their failures to focus on their successes).  \n\nBut in the playoffs, your performance in each and every game is under a microscope.  When hero ball works, you are a god. When it doesn\'t, you are anything but. \n\nSo in situations like this, they\'re reverting to their instincts that have largely worked for them their entire lives,  thinking, "my team needs me, I\'ve gotta take over, just like my hero did."  It usually works for them, but tonight, it did not. And every night in the playoffs that it doesn\'t work, we notice it a lot more. \n\ntl;dr  It\'s not you, it\'s me. 
Meanwhile Steph Curry had one game in college where he stood in the corner and let his teammates win. Curry came in averaging 35 after 5 games and the opposing coach thought they had no chance after watching him warmup. The opposing coach decided to double curry and literally go 3 on 4 with everyone else. \n\nEdit: tbh, this really doesn't mean anything, but your comment made me remember it. 
Even Kobe passed it to Ron Artest when it came down to the last minutes of the fourth. He wanted to win! Bron wanted to be the hero
I've never noticed it until now but I think Lebron genuinely hates Steph. 
Lebrons a pretty reasonable man
So he definitely hates him.
Has been reported a few times that he's mad jealous..
I think this season has shown that LeBron doesn't like not being considered the unanimous King. Even in Miami people hated him but we all still knew he was the best. This season with all the Curry love he just started to go into diva mode. 
I definitely don't think they like each other very much.
I don't think so, he just got super heated once he knew they lost. 
he hates Steph cause Steph gave his point guard three hezzies. [THREE HEZZIES DOE. Not 1, not 2, but THREE HEZZIES](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wX3eoMeXmzg).
And that nerdy kid takes rings from you years later. What a time to be alive.
its for sure weird. usually superstars who are adversaries have mutual respect for each other (kobe-lebron, kobe-garnett/pierce, durant-lebron). I feel like there is no relationship with these two.
It's not like Kobe/LeBron ever had a real rivalry though and LeBron handed KD's ass to him about every time they played.
I vaguely remember a video from the 2014 all star game or the olympics where Lebron is joking with Curry about how Curry schooled his point guard. Seems pretty friendly then. \n\nEdit: found it http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=wX3eoMeXmzg
He's no longer the top dog and it's hurting his ego. \n\nAbsolutely love it. 
> I don't think it's that, he's better than Steph as an overall player, but Steph has an amazing supporting cast that LeBron is probably jealous of. As well as a better coach.\n\nAs well as a jump shot. And range. And handles. And agility. And humility. 
And class, scruples, better looking, better passing, better teammate and connection with his team.
Must be why Cavaliers are up 3-1.
Don't forget NBA Finals winning percentage.
At what point can we stop blaming the supporting cast? Hes got the most expensive team ever and he picked these players. 
It'd be damn near impossible to pick out a better supporting cast than what Steph has in Golden State. 
Yeah but it the Cavs still have a very good one. It isnt like its Lebron against the world.
\\**Checks Warriors roster to see if GOAT Speights is still there*\\*  My god, he's right...
Goat was not needed to win the game
Yes, the prophesied 90 point game from the GOAT, our true savior, Mo H Speights.\n\nLet us bask in his eternal glory, yay be, rub the nub.
Yeah but he didnt realize he needed more chuckers. He's angry at himself for that and projects his anger onto the most prolific chucker of all time, who just so happens to be stealing the spotlight from him.
Needs more chuckers???
More chuckers?\n\nJ.R Smith, Mo Williams, Kevin Love, Matt Dellavedova, and Channing Frye all like to shoot. Cavs don't need chuckers, they need to play less iso. A lot less. 
Della never shoots.. Frye is a big man who seems to have lost his shot.. the team looks like it needs an explosive player off the bench.. 
He doesn't need more chuckers but teammates that actually have complete skillsets. 
He made a team in 2014 to win titles and they were perfectly constructed to do that. They are custom built to stomp the East (they do) then beat the Spurs or the Thunder in the Finals (Regular season: 2-2 vs SA and 3-1 vs OKC). What happened is they (along with the other 28 teams) weren't expecting the Warriors to come out of nowhere and change all the rules. People want to shit on LeBron and the Cavs roster, but this is simply a threat no one anticipated or the Warriors wouldn't follow a 67 win and title season with 73 fucking wins and probably another title.
Agreed completely. Guy makes it to the Finals in his first 2 seasons back in Cleveland. Just happens to go up against a team that completely outdo them in match ups. Doesn't help that they had arguabley one of the greatest seasons of all time this year either.
>Doesn't help that they had arguabley one of the greatest seasons of all time this year either.\n\n73 - 9. There's no argument about whether this was one of the greatest.\n
I don't think the warriors work with lebron or westbrook or most not curry superstars. They'd still be good, but only curry would make them a 73 win team
I think its that LeBron has unquestionably been the face of the NBA for a while and this kid comes out of freaking nowhere to not only eclipse him, but take his Cleveland rings.
Yeah. He's gotta be pissed that GSW basically rained on his #ComingHome parade last year.
The Warriors broke the Bulls single season record. Curry is taking winning in the latter end of LeBron's career. As great as LeBron is, I think he'll be in MJ and Kobe's shadow. He's watching his legacy diminish before his eyes. Coming home has not gone as planned
This is the first time i feel like im watching lebron feel threatened by another basketball player on the court. and i love it/hate it as a big lebron fan during the dark days between we believe and now
All because of one skinny scrappy dude with funny Under Armours :D
You think so? I think Lebron was just mad. Which is surprising because Lebron rarely blows up.
Steph makes Lebron super insecure it's hilarious 
Do you blame him? I would hate most of the guys on the warriors too if they took title chances from you in back to back seasons. Its not over yet but its basically over. 
No I agree. It's the first time it spilled out but that was a menacing convo those two were having on the court. Completely out of character for bron. 
I mean Ayesha over there doing her mom of the year shit, steph draining 3's and winning ships, dominating the male nurse shoe market, why wouldn't Lebron be pissed? He hand picked this team and still can't win\n\nEdit: Show to shoe because I was drunk \xf0\x9f\x99\x83
male nurse show market fuck. lmao
not to be a complete dumbshit, but i kinda dont get it
Curry's new shoes. There is a top post on the subreddit

When you're Cleveland and you still suckin'
It's doubled the comment it came off of so no, it's not underrated.
/r/clevelandstillsucking
you got my hopes up, dick
Seriously though did the Warriors throw game 3 just so they could win this one at home?
I said that after game 3 and was immediately down voted. 
I think they've lost Game 3 in most 7 game series under Kerr. It's a thing.
LeBron was acting so smug after game 3 I'm glad he got his ass handed to him.
lol don't even cite his stats. his obvious stat padding makes everything he did in the last minute just bs.
He had so many chances to tear into the paint and take over but chose to pass instead. The numbers might be nice and all but could have been so much more effective 
Yes.  They want to have the riots at home this year.
Can't really riot at oracle. We'd flood out into... a parking lot.
That's LA bruh
A bunch of rioters will run into O.Co then immediately run out screaming "Someone already fucked that place up! What do we do now?!?!"
We can all go to In n Out!
I love it. Anything to ruin LeBron
Had to give Cleveland some false hope.

Looks like some kind of fucking horrifying Silent Hill creature
I'm so hard rn 
That's what he gets for that wanna be AI step over
Yeah, Draymond just caught Lebron's balls head-first, that's all. 
Because he was trying to get up and get back into play, which LeBron was preventing being a dick.
He could've easily walked around in a step. He was going out of his way
AI did it when he was balling out of control, LeBron did it away from the ball just to be an asshole.
When he was losing. You gotta back up a move that big with your game
The Warriors' ability to contain Lebron tonight was exceptional!\n\nHe even lost his temper!\n\nSeriously though, Golden State did an amazing job of limiting Lebron's effectiveness on offense tonight.
LeBron is one of the players that can get away with murder on the court simply because he's LeBron. It's hilarious
they didnt call fouls on warriors also. It was called evenly on both side. The referees were equal on both sides. 
LET THE BOYS PLAY ^^^unless ^^^we ^^^need ^^^free ^^^throws
Did you miss the blatant foul on Iggy at the end of the half? Don't blame the refs, your team lost. 
Your fries are ready for that salt now...
Even more amazing was him losing during an ACTIVE play. The ball was live.
Lebron shouldn't be trying to play mind games with Green. 
Green is like an Internet troll yell at him and he grows stronger off of your hatred
Watching Draymond Green and LeBron James jawing at and getting in each others faces is like watching humanity\xe2\x80\x99s version of two big ass Bighorn Sheep ramming their heads against each other on Animal Planet.
LBJ trying to act tough with that step over bullshit.
i would laugh is Green move up quickly and hit James in the balls during that move. it might start a fight
Green is doing that thing that some bars do where you drink the beers of the world and you get a t-shirt or something. Except it's Balls Of The NBA and he wins the ability to breath with his mouth closed if he touches all of them during regulation. 
*holy fuck*
This might seriously be the funniest goddamn thing I have ever read on Reddit, lmao

Reading your comment history from during the game was such a rollercoaster of emotions
It really was.\n\nIt legitimately looked like we could win it there in the 3rd.

No way the Cavs win three straight, especially two in Oracle.

This is blasphemy Lil B would never do that, he's from the bay!
Sorry bro, Lil B is a Bay Area native. That said, the Cleveland sports curse might be stronger than the based god curse 
I don't know what Cleveland did to get that curse but they probably deserved it. 
The Cleveland curse is older than Lil B himself. 
The Cleveland curse is ancient, everyone knows this. 
About that...

Yup
Apologize
IT HAPPENED FAM
Leave it to Cleveland to lose it at home, though.

Yea not to count out Cavs but 2 in Oracle? Good luck.

LeBron post game interview: "I said I was going to win a ring for the land... That\'s why I\'m taking my talents to Oakland"
we don't want him
It's not dumb. Adding Lebron would most likely ruin the Warriors dynamic.
No thank you.\n\nUnless he wants to play for the Raiders
49ers fan here. I'll take him.
no thanks, we already have one insufferable man child on our team.\n\n#AND I FUCKING LOVE DRAYMOND
Draymond keeps #23
Lebron played for the Oakland Soldiers AAU team as a teenager. He can take Harrison's money and we can pretend that it's a homecoming.
I thought it was win a ring for the And
And Varajao 
oh god...
Nuh uh don't you bring that Based God Obeah down on us
He would remove since lil b is from the bay
Part of his contract would be he is required to play lil B In a game of 21
After getting into it with Green and Curry? Not a chance. No room for hero ball on that squad.
He did that when the rest of his team was being trash. There were atleast 3 Cav players in double digits before LeBron, and Love was playing well too. Until the fourth quarter, when its all about me. The difference is someone on GSW had to step up, vs tonight where it was neck and neck most of the game UNTIL cavs started iso'ing.
Hero ball is fine if you win haha. Hero ball doesn't look so good when your iso's result in 7 minutes without making a FG in the 4th quarter.
Sports are about winning. Winning depends on the result. So yes, I am. Enjoy your high horse, which would probably come last at the Belmont Stakes. 
dont worry, i wouldn't want him on our team anyways is what I was getting at.
People who have been warriors fans for the past 2 years think they're basketball masterminds. This sub has been atrocious lately.
I actually 100% agree. It would be poison to our team. Let's forget about his ego butting heads with Kerr's plays, he would hurt our chemistry. He is too much the blaming type to gel with the Warriors
honestly why would you? they just won 73 and are about to win back to back, why would you add a superstar that inherently changes the chemistry of the team?
your mind amazes me
He can get his minutes as a 6th man. 
Yeah, if Iggy leaves to get paid LeBron would be a decent replacement. Needs to work on his three though.
It's gone full circle. Iggy is no longer the poor man's Lebron and LeBron is the poor man's Iggy.
Kerr -  Guys, keep thompson down. Hes smashing us in rebounds and energy on the paint. Cant afford to let him continue playing like this. We have to shut him down!\n\n\nLue -  Dw Kerr i got this. Yo Tristan, come, take a seat. 
Thompson was actually in the game when warriors had their biggest offensive rebounds. He was just gassed because he was playing all quarter where as Dray and Barnes had some time to sit before the 4th.
Tyron Lue constantly looks like he just walked into a room where everyone is laughing at a joke that he didn't hear\n\n
so GS gave away game 3 to win at home right?
thats what i was hoping for, always sucks doing a trophy presentation away
But how else is Cleveland going to see a championship?
TV, just like every year for every sport ever.
Come on, man. Cleveland has already seen a [championship](http://media.gettyimages.com/photos/members-of-the-golden-state-warriors-gather-after-winning-the-nba-picture-id477383208).

I reckon GSW didn't want to set off a riot by beating them at their home, again.
I said that in the last game thread I had -40 karma on that comment.

LeBron was trying to get Draymond to commit a flagrant foul. 
What do I have to do to get a double technical around here?\n-Lebron to ref
Don't see why he was in Curry's face then. Lebron just seemed mad.
Yeah. 
Tonight, a bunch of LeBron haters became Draymond Green lovers
/r/nba still hates Green, but maybe less
I wouldn't say I'm a Draymond lover but definitely less of a hater. I just love seeing him not get intimidated by LeBron in the least
Varejao deserves a statue outside of the Oracle arena for his hustle. He won us the game.
3 offensive rebounds and a shit ton of hustle/heart in a minute or so of game time... Damn impressive
You're an idiot if you can't recognize the huge momentum swing caused by Varejao's hustle.
Ripples create waves my friend
Kevin love deserves a statue in front of oracle for letting Varejao work his ass all night
He must lead the league in fouls given/drawn per minute though.\n\nDamn.
Best 1 minute of the finals by any player. 
A 60 second assassin.
Don't understand the boos when he was cut from the team
Cleveland fans are the real bandwagoners
Did you see that crowd? What else do you expect from them?
Just mob mentality. No logic in the booing
Cavs were pretty good for a lot of Anderson's career there. They had 4 losing seasons in his time there. I don't like them booing him, but still it's not like Andy dealt with terrible circumstances his whole time in Cleveland.
It's the realisation that he's going to get a ring before the Cavs do... The fans are almost as butthurt as Lebron seems to be
Before Game 1 of the Finals, he was already a champion.
It's in the rule book somewhere. If you have a certain amount of games on a team in one season and are traded away/cut before the end of it and they win, you're entitled to a ring. The magic number was like 32 or something
All series long I've wanted to see Varejao play and dominate his old team.  Sure, it was only against Kevin Love, but it was still satisfying to watch.  
That was just the right amount of Klove shade. 
Those offensive rebounds. Holy shit.
Chin up Cavs fans, at least you get free tacos.
Everyone gets free tacos, even the GSW fans lol

inside joke to his dad, but... media loves to create controversy.
Draymonds effort is some Rodman level shit\n
When people talk who would win, Jordan Bulls or Curry Warriors... that's the matchup I wish we could see the most. Sure, seeing Jordan and Pippen guarding Curry and Klay would be epic. But the main attraction would absolutely be Rodman vs Dray. It would be fucking amazing. 
Can anyone for a sec look what LeBron did at the end of the game. It shouldn't go unnoticed. Down 10 and 4 straight positions, should I take a three or pass to an open man for a three? Nope drive it and pad my stats 4 straight plays to not even try to come back. It's pathetic. He choked but of course they'll look at his stats and say HERP DERP HE NEEDS HELP. 
Hoping the best FT shooting back court in the league would miss enough for his layups to tie the game up with less than a minute and no timeouts remaining... yea the math doesn't add up.
Why doesn't he just do that when the game is getting out of hand? He realistically can score when he really wants to. I just don't get it. I know I don't play against anyone near the same level as an NBA player but if I'm the best guy on the court and we need a bucket in taking that shit to the hole. He does that better than anyone. So frustrating to watch as a LeBron fan.
I honestly don't know. Does he get scared or something. It's so frustrating to watch and pisses me off. Watching kobe for my whole life then LeBron just makes me dislike so much. His ability to shoot really hurts him and when he drives he gets doubled. But I feel he can always drive but he shys away. When it doesn't work for him he gets afraid of missing and doesn't take over. Not right 
You just can't call yourself the best in the game and be afraid to take the big shots.
Nah the warriors were letting him get anything he wanted inside at the end.  They just didn't want 3s or fouls because they knew they wouldn't choke the long game.
Can I say that perhaps LeBron has Jordan's eye for roster building?
LeBron used to take over games and had a pretty reliable 3 pointer when called upon. Nowadays his accuracy from downtown is atrocious! When did he lose that skill? 
His shot was always bad. His form is terrible so it's inconsistent. He practiced it a lot when he was younger because he wanted to play pretty. He doesn't shoot nearly as much anymore and his jank ass form isn't one that will let you shoot well unless you're shooting it all the time.
When he left Miami he changed. His shot was never great but this is worse than it's ever been. 
When curry absorbed it. That's how he has all the threes.
Kerr disrespecting my man Speights with only 6 seconds of play time.\n\nHe needs at least 30 seconds to get an OREB and a 3
Don't forget the 2 fouls as well.

Wait, really? \n\nThe fuck did Green do? 
Apparently Green said something disrespectful. Broussard is saying he called Lebron a bitch.
Well...\n\n\nHe is
bitch move, leave that shit on the court. 
Honest, I don't mind that at the start but don't pull that shit when the game is almost over and your team is losing. Just shows frustration more than competition.

He's Rodman with offense. 
I read this like it was slam poetry 
Did you see him win the stare off with LeBron on the tip. What a man.
plus SO smart to not get a tech when lebron was crumbling and getting pissed in his face! ITS OVA!
LeBron really didn't handle the last few minutes of game time with any amount of grace. Looked almost out of control during that Dray interaction.
There's a reason he garnered Kobe's respect. He's a competitor to the death. 
[What Kobe thinks of these Cavs](http://i.imgur.com/i1Ok6qN.gifv)
This just makes me angry we never got the Kobe-Lebron finals , the trash talking alone, from kobe , would've made for so many soundbites 
Meh... Kobe has the utmost respect for Bron (though I'm sure he's glad he has fewer than 5).\n\nActually, come to think of it, maybe in '09 it'd have been great when LeBron was anointed best player in the league while Kobe was putting up 34-6-6 on 63% TS% (and yes I remember somehow LeBron was better in the ECF, but I'm sure Kobe felt disrespected anyways).
Re: Game 7, here are the words from his own mouth:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvnauVtNA6Q\n\nI\'m inclined to agree with him. Kobe averaged 35.4 ppg that season. I distinctly remember what our offensive strategy was in that series. We were actually running Kwame post ups. Slow the game down. As a result? 28 ppg in that series. In wins? 23.3 ppg, on 21.7 used possessions (FGA + FT/2). In losses? 31 ppg, on 25.5 used possesions.\n\nIn Game 4, when they made the  comeback? It was a team effort.\n\nI know I\'m not going to change your mind. Been on the internet long enough. But I remember this game clearly. And I don\'t think he "gave up": he made a concerted effort to get the ball to his teammates, and they failed. He scored 50 ppg, including 12 in OT, the previous game, and they still lost. Should he have taken over and see what happens? In retrospect, it\'d have been better, sure. Hindsight is 20/20. Does that mean he "gave up"? I don\'t see it.\n\n\n---\n\nThe rest of your post (regarding LeBron vs. Kobe etc.) is so loaded that I\'d spend hours unpacking it just to address it properly. I\'ll pass on that one. We have our beliefs on that and we\'re not going to change our minds.\n
Kobe respects a lot of people, just not on the court; remember he even called that ref a "bundle of sticks" ?
He's the enforcer. He'll absorb all the hate and criticism to deflect it from his teammates. Every team needs that. 
You're lying if you say the Nuggets would not benefit from a Draymond Green.
every team would benefit from a draymond green.
And he'll also act as the muscle so his team doesn't get intimidated by someone like LeBron. A team like GSW who're otherwise smaller and mostly good guys needs Green. 
He's BatMan!\n
Rodman 2.0
better 
Not only that, but he's an amazing player. 1st All NBA Defense and 2nd All NBA, plus carrying the team emotionally. Amazing.
Draymond FMVP?
I wish someone would've stepped up for him when shit went down though.
he don't need someone to step up tho. the enforcer has a heart of ice. when shit hits the fan its just a party with confetti for draymond.
Yup. It was obvious Lebron was tryina bait him and anyone else would've fallen for that. The judo take down, no foul, AND the step-over? But Green was cold as fucking ice. Not only does he *remain in the game and get the rebound, afterwards he only gets in Lebron's face, has a few words, and just walks away*. Like holy shit, to have the presence of mind to just *walk away* and not do something that'd get him a flagrant or a tech.
Disrespectful to TT to have him on the bench in the 4th. Lue has no fucking clue 
\xf0\x9f\x97\xa1\xf0\x9f\x94\xab
Lebron with the garbage time 6 points lol.\nGotta pad those stats
Score 3s. The warriors were gonna give him all the layups in the world and he kept taking them.
twos were worthless. The warriors were making their free throws so the cavs needed threes. Instead he was taking twos that the warriors wanted him to take.
Who loved LeStatPad at the end? 
i mean, what was he going to do, LeBrick some 3s? He's gotta fix that jump this off season.
He had it in Miami somewhat. If he just gets back to that point it'll make a big difference.
You know Draymond said something personal like "Space Jam 2 is gonna suck"
How are there 218 comments in here when it was posted "just now"
DOMINATE POST GAME
Welcome to reddit.
We all have no life 
Ball is life 
Not sure what was more embarrassing, the Cavs offense or LeBron acting like a total bitch.
That was crazy. Lebron is usually so calm with that. He started that by trying to be Allen Iverson to Draymond's Lue.
When he was acting like a bitch last game blocking Currys lay up after the play was dead everyone on here was riding his nuts. 
Difference between "acting like a bitch" and "showing who\'s boss" is whether you\'re winning or losing. 
LeBron being a bitch isn't new behavior for him
Looked like Dray took his candy and Bron Bron had to cry about it
Everyone loses, and no one would blame Lebron for losing to a better team, but acting that petty is all on him 
Completely irrelevant response.
Supersonics logic
ahh yes lets make this about Fuck Draymond
I hate Draymond as much as anyone, but that is ridiculous. Lebron was a bitch tonight
I think Dray just knew if he picked up more techs he'd be in trouble. He got hotheaded but cooled off when he remembered the possible incoming suspension. 
It's all about composure man. And I don't know how this happened but *Draymond Green* kept his...that's the real story here. Like whoa
did you miss him fouling steph when the game was basically over and then having the nerve to jaw back? or when he tried to step over green ,green obviously taking exception and then lets green jump over him for the rebound right afterwards, there's a thin line between being pissed at losing and using that to play better, and letting it get to you, and it may be one of those things where ,we're looking at it more closely b/c he just lost in the finals instead of another game, but  it still looked REALLY bad when it seemed like the other players had calmed down *mostly* 
I actually get it. Must be so frustrating to have gone back to Cleveland, assembled your own hand-picked team, and still fallen short in consecutive years. Any competitive person would be extremely frustrated in his situation. 
It is but he should be looking in the mirror , getting him and Green or Curry thrown out is not going to help the Cavs turn this around 
Yeah, this is a rare game where his fit throwing was painfully obvious from the start. 
As someone said, James can step over other people without retaliation, but when its a better team, that shit doesn't fly. Kudos to Green not decking him in the face. 
No one would blame Lebron losing to a better team\n\nHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
sadly this is the case. People will always make excuses for Lebron not winning in the finals - blaming his teammates, his coach, anything but his own play.
I don't understand this argument at all. We must be following different conversations about him. Lebron has been raked over the coals for losing finals no matter how well he's played.
LeBron gets more shit than any athlete in any sport. 
You're right. I'm a Lebron fan and make excuses for him a lot. But generally I'd say outside of us Lebron apologists people are irrationally hard on him. There's really only so much one man can do.
I've seen people blaming Lebron for assembling a team whose talents don't complement each other very well compared to GS but that itself shows most people believe GS is a better team. Lebron the player is still good, Lebron the GM needs to retire for a few years 
He's basically top 5 all time in NBA Finals PTS/AST/REB and people are already defining his legacy as choking in the finals. If Lebron doesn't win the finals he will be blamed no matter how sound your logic may be.
This shit isn't doing anything for his legacy. Another year another loss isn't some awesome track record.
Can't tell if you're being sarcastic or not. Stacking your team with three all-stars and going through the weaksauce east is not an accomplishment.
In a one team Eastern Conference it's impressive but not as impressive as if he did it in the West. The competition he faced is so staggeringly bad compared to the West.
I can see the Pistons beating the Rockets but IMO the Blazers were a better team than the Hawks in the playoffs. the Hawks are absolute trash in the playoffs, can't even win a single game against the Cavs. 
> No ~~one~~rational person would blame Lebron for losing to a better team\n\nBetter? \n
That's a perfect summary of his entire career excluding 2011.
The LeBron hate right now is ridiculous. 24 hours ago, people were all over his dick, now it's a full on 180. r/NBA likes to rip Skip Bayless and sports media, but the truth is most people can't critically think for themselves after a game and need a pushed storyline.
Or maybe.....just mayyyyybe....when gsw wins, all the gsw fans come out to gloat....and when the cavs won, all the cavs fans came out to gloat. Shocking.
That "fight" with Draymond was hilarious
Sure the loss was embarassing, but Lebron acting like a punk ass bitch was straight up disgraceful. You're repping your city, and you can't control your emotions when you're losing? That last pull on curry was completely uncalled for. 
Every (good) NBA player blocks shots after the whistle. Ever since KG started that shit. It's nothing new. 
Sorry gotta do it.  2-5 or 2 for 7
Exactly, you still have time, why the fuck was he worried about jawing and then going for two each possession...
The Warriors really got to him this series 
Draymond really got into his head tonight.
Somewhere Lance Stephenson is worshipping his personal Dray shrine.
I'm just waiting for the inevitable Dray/Delly knife fight at halftime in game 6
So, you've got the Cavs winning @Oracle? Bold move, cotton. 
Bogut v Delly in a game of knifey/spoony. 
You think the cavs are gonna win a road game?
no... they can't
Game 6? That's a long wait for a train don't come.
Assuming game 6 even happens now.
lol there won't be one
Yeah, what? This is over Monday.
The Cavs need to defeat the monstars to retrieve Lebron's jumpshot
Could you imagine if the desperation ever got there?\n\nLike Lebron is actually in the locker room post game tonight talking to the starters.\n\n"I know this sounds crazy but [the answer was in the meme](http://imgur.com/rBdtY6c) all along. will you guys get into my Kia with me and drive to charlotte and find a way to get that [Secret Stuff](http://8328-presscdn-0-65.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/lebrons-secret-stuff.jpeg)?\n\n*Lebron & friends weekend adventure before game 5*
He was quite the chatty cathy towards the end.
It's so rare to see Lebron get this heated.
Heated...get it? 
Would love to listen what he said to Steph
Probably about how salty this game tasted. 
I love the stink face Steph gave him like "dude, why are you even talking shit when you\'re down by almost double digits with less than a minute to go."
My money's still on LeBron in a fight tho... 
And you\'re mad I\'m complaining to the refs? YOU Lebron James?!
Steph had the upper hand and the lead *and* the stink face. You know Lebron is gonna be in the shower reliving that confrontation over and over for years. 
Gonna be fun to watch fans like you when Steph goes on to win 4 or 5 rings while Lebron sits at 2
Yeah a whole 2... Wait Curry's catching up! Oh no!
Money isn't everything.
Not for long
Why? 
Perhaps you have forgotten what an arrogant prick he was in Miami and talking about how many finals he was going to win in a row? Or when he quit on his team vs Dallas in the finals or even tonight when he scores 4 points in the first half or vs the Spurs when he is getting crushed in a series and walks around in post games saying "I am still the best player in the world that is why I am confident we can win this" Sorry if Lebron is going to act like the best he needs to prove it not act like a bitch every time a call goes against him and disappear for entire halves of finals games.
I felt that way about his 2007 loss. He's obviously a great player, but he's done this to himself. Predicts a million titles in Miami. Bounces when Wade and Bosh start slowing down. Forms another super team with younger players. Hand picks his teammates and coach. Not to mention his phases of insane arrogance. I can't feel sorry for him. 
yes
God I am cracking up reading this subthread.
Curry for 3
I think I saw LeBron (on the replay where we can see Stephs face clearly and the side of Lebrons) say "you\'re soft" and steph said something like "get outta here man"
So soft that he scored 38 and they have a 3-1 series lead. \n\n
I loveed when everyone started chanting "Draymond sucks". He thrives on that kinda thing. It was no surprise when he hulked out right after and started blocking the shit out of everything LeBron came at him with.
I guess every super hero needs his theme music
I  kept waiting for him to rip his jersey off and sue Gawker for all of the monies. 
It didn't even phase him. \n\nHell he even went to contest Lebron's missed dunk, no fucks given.
I love it when guys do that, especially against people like Lebron.  You have to respect someone who tries to play good defense even when it means asking to get posterized.
Seriously he is the prime example of haters feeding someone to do their best. 
Haters make Dray famous
He's an msu alum. He feeds of disrespekt.
Man, those State Farm Kevin Love commercials sure did disappear fast 
BABY DAME DOLLA HERE TRAILBLAZING DIMES EVERYWHERE
TL;DR: Draymond talks shit; backs it up.
Nothing better than see LeBron be  such a cry baby. And then lose.
I'm not sure I want Space Jam 2 featuring LeBron.
I want Kobe
If the Warriors win it all then I will eat a bowl of cereal and post proof.
Is it just me or does Lue just look hella lost all the time haha? Like not even hating dude just seems genuinely perplexed like he got kidnapped and placed on an NBA floor with no idea how he got there
[Kerr's reaction to Lue's coaching](https://premium.wpmudev.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/nicolas-cage-laughing.gif)
I don\'t care whether people think this is "playoff basketball", the standard of refereeing is awful. JVG said it well, it\'s not letting them play, it\'s just not calling fouls. It makes it hard for me to enjoy the game.\n\nAt least they don\'t seem to be favoring a specific team. But it\'s a problem.\n
No, rotating set.
Wasn't as big of a problem as everyone's trying to make it out to be.
I'll agree it was fairly even both ways, I still think not calling fouls benefits the worse team though.
LeBron got away with bloody murder.\n\nEdit: LeBron's stepover would have been a technical if Green did it.\n\nLeBron smacks Iguodala's hand and there's no call.\n\nLeBron flails his elbows and hits Livingston in the face.. No call. Smh.
I completely disagree. I loved it.
Agreed, I long for physical play in the NBA.
I\'m with x-man, I don\'t give a fuck about either of these teams, but I think fans, "NBA" fans, deserve better basketball than what we saw tonight as a result of the officiating. It was a shit show man.\n\nMy girlfriend who doesn\'t know dick about basketball/sports said it best tonight: "Why are we still watching this sweaty man pileup?"
Right there with you. Great physical basketball. Calls were missed on both sides but for the most part, the refs allowed tough play.
Typically I would be more likely to agree with you but, this game seemed to go overboard with bad non-calls that favored Cleveland for about 3 quarters and then GSW in the 4th. Very weird and annoying.
I like free-flowing basketball, but it just seems a bit much to me. I agree with a bit of leniency on ticky-tacky fouls, but I'm talking about a lot of obvious fouls that just aren't being called.\n\nThere's a fine line between free-flowing and dangerous due to a lack of refereeing. I dunno if we'll get to dangerous, but the referees are letting people get away with too much, in my opinion.
Agreed. Reminds me of the blacktop days where we were fouling every possession, but too prideful to call anything. 
[No blood no foul](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/de2Rv5eijvA/maxresdefault.jpg)
For real. I didn't enjoy watching any part of this game. Jus threw my hands up in disbelief the whole time. I want to love the finals but I can't.
I enjoyed the game, but some of the shit they were allowing was dangerous and it seemed it just kept escalating. Glad no one got hurt. 
Yeah, there was a stretch in the 3rd where I was honestly wondering if the refs had lost their whistles. Both teams kept escalating the contact, and still nothing. The players committing the would-be-fouls even looked shocked when they weren't called. Guys would steal the ball, look around for the whistle, and then play on, incredulous.
The problem isn't even missing calls.  It's calling certain things tight and then missing the calls.  The players need some expectation for how the game is going to be called, and in this game the refs were calling tickytack shit and not calling harder fouls.  You simply can't have that.\n\nAlso, can someone explain how that Bogut alley-oop wasn't a shooting foul?  I don't understand how that was a possible outcome in that situation.  Like, the NBA refereeing processes should not have allowed that.  It was called a foul, on a very clear alley-oop interrupted by the called foul, but then wasn't calling a shooting foul.  That's breaking process.
It\'s not calling fouls.\n\nKevin Live obviously fouls Andy:\n\n"That\'s a flop! You can\'t call fouls for a flopper!"
I thought that was one of the most ridiculous and biased things I've heard a commentator say...\n\nHe clearly pushed him down. It's not a foul just because he has a history? That's not how it works.
He's been like that for the last two finals. Him and MJax are idiots. 
He also said "Lebron needs to shoot more 3\'s and jumpers in order to win" Might be better off just watching these games on mute to be honest I about fell out of my chair when he said that, the guy is struggling to score from 10 feet away and you want to move him out of his comfort zone?
He actually said "LeBron needs to take and make" those outside shots. The secret this whole time is that LeBron just needs to start making shots! How did LeBron and Lue not notice this yet? \n\nI usually love JVG but he\'s been off this series.
He got called out on it by the other commentator.\n\nYou could hear it in his voice that he knew he was wrong. Anyone with an ego doubles down in that situation though so he didn't recant.
Watching Varejao has been fascinating for me. A bad flopper will feel contact and then embellish the reaction. A good flopper, and Varejao is a very good flopper, anticipates when contact is about to be made, and sets himself up to flop so it looks like a natural reaction.\n\nIn that play, he knows Kevin Love is going to push him. He could have stood his ground there, you just take that extra stabalizing step when you\'re pushed. But he decides early "when Love pushes me I\'m gonna fall", so you see his (I don\'t remember, left or right) foot kind of freeze and not move, so his body just falls over naturally without that foot placed in a stabilizing position.\n\nFrom Love\'s perspective, he\'s thinking "I\'m gonna push Varejao just a little bit to move him out of the way to clear the lane." Maybe he should realize Varejao is gonna flop on the play, but he doesn\'t, so you see Love also falls on the play too, he wasn\'t expecting Varejao to fall over when he pushes him. And then he gets mad when the foul is called, "I barely touched him!". Well true, but you did touch him, you clearly pushed him. Varejao is simply thinking one step ahead of his opponent to draw the foul. \n\nNow what I would love to see is for the "fouler" to realize he is being guarded by Varejao, and in those situations where it is normal to put a little contact on the player, just lay off completely. Like if I were Kevin Love during that play, I would move towards Varejao making it seem like I\'m about to push him, but at the last second lay off completely and not touch him at all. I don\'t know if that happens ever, but it would be interesting to see what Varejao does in that situation. Does he flop? Does he freeze up and do nothing? Does he roll with it and use the space to make a move? Because it seems like Varejao commits so early in the play to flopping, I don\'t know if he can cancel it on the fly if his man were to try to fake the contact.
that was totally a foul, van gundy was holding varejo's rep to a higher degree than the actual play.  varejo has always been a flopper, but in that play in particular he was clearly pushed by love
Lebron chooses to pad his stats with layups instead of working for 3s to end the game.
This made absolutely no sense whatsoever. You're in a position where only quick threes can potentially get you back in the game, but no, LeBron just doesn't believe in math I guess. 
The only math Lebron believes in is statistics.
lbj has always chased stats.
he's a notorious stat watcher. surprised he didn't go for an assist to get the triple double.
Yeah, what the hell was that? They desperately needed three pointers and instead he kept getting easy layups...which is exactly what the warriors wanted with curry and klay on the floor. It would be a long shot, but that game was still winnable.
I\'m not sure about what 3 there were alot of them\n\n\nDam Klay such shade lol 
Thanks for the tacos for the stolen game. Everyone can hit up Taco Bell now.    \nhttps://www.tacobell.com/StealATaco
June 21st??? The fuck is that shit?? 
First time in his career I've seen Lebron 'crack' like this.  Just the other day he was giving a post game interview and everyone was praising how much he's matured since coming into the league.  Then you have a game like this where he seemed to lose it mentally.  \n\n\nHe's playing the team game.  Letting his teammates take shots.  There was a time when we'd see him takeover.. demand the ball.. put it all on his shoulders.  He's not doing that anymore.  I'd like to think he's just staying committed to playing team basketball.  Although part of me thinks he's just not that good anymore to take over and drop 45 on people.  
You didn't see the finals vs the Mavs???
He just checked out that series. This series you can see it getting to him.
his jumper isn't consistent enough to do that. It started declining in the last year in Miami and we are seeing the aftereffects now.\n
How does that work? He had a 30% jumper for years. Loses to the mavs with Miami, gets into the paint, beats OKC, then vs the Spurs, his jumper showed up. Now, 2 years in a row it's gotten worse.\nDoes he just not practice that? Defenses getting smarter?
I think his form is terrible so he has to shoot a ton to be decent with it. Since he's committed to the paint post 2011 besides that run in 2013 playoffs he's never shot well.\n\n
The way the Cavs played in the first half, I thought they were going to run away with another one and make this a best-of-three series for the championship. But Golden State completely turned the tables on that idea - or, I think more accurately - the Cavs turned them on themselves. Cleveland\xe2\x80\x99s offense stagnated in the second half - especially in the 4th, where it seemed like there was zero ball/off-ball player movement, and A LOT of ISO plays for Kyrie and Bron (reminded me of the playoff Raptors in certain stages- I was left wondering, does this team even run plays?). This was all evidenced by the fact that at one point in the 4th, the Cavs went without a FG for almost seven minutes. Hard to beat a team of GS\xe2\x80\x99s calibre when that happens, whether at home or not. \n\nBelieve it or not, Cavs actually shot a higher percentage than GS in the second half, but they lost because of that cold stretch and that they only made one three pointer after half (compared to ~8 for GS). The fact the Warriors set an NBA-finals record with 17 3PM hurt Cleveland as well.\n\nAnyway, I was hoping Cleveland would win this one so that we would be *guaranteed* to delay the start of the offseason a bit longer. But I think now the repeat is pretty much a done deal (considering how hard GS is to beat at home, and that no team has ever recovered from a 3-1 deficit in the NBA finals). Nice to finally watch a competitive Finals game, though. The previous three games were complete duds (from a neutral fan\xe2\x80\x99s view) but at least this one was watchable and competitive through the 4th q - basically all I was hoping for at this point!\n\nEdit: added sentence about Warriors setting NBA Finals single game 3PM team record.
How can you blame Kyrie's isos though, it was the only source of points on that team. 
Lol did you pre type this up
It was the 2nd comment in, and we're now 6 minutes in with over 800. I'd say so. \n\nI-- I mean-- Big if true.
That's just professionalism man. Like reporters who work on deadline.
It's all about that All The Right Type training. Get your WPM crazy high
I could tell you, but it'll cost you Amir Johnson and tree fiddy.
I feel like the Warriors are the most mentally tough team in the league. You can look at the Western Conference Finals as example A, but even in tonight's game they showed resolve and played hard and *smart* through the fourth, even while the Cavaliers were playing amazing basketball. \n
During the OKC series, GS just kept taking haymaker after haymaker, but they never deviated from the game plan, along with a bit of luck.
There's no shame in losing to the Warriors, but the Cavs gave this game away. They went to iso ball in the 4th when Kyrie and Lebron were exhausted, which makes no sense. Kerr got his guys rest, even when it meant playing poor options, and it worked out in crunch time. Cavs had to win this one and they blew it, so frustrating. 
Lol @ "poor options", on a 73-9 team. The Warriors are better, period.
I mean that's what happens against the Warriors. We did it too. Warriors play stupid hard D in the 4th forcing you to go ISO. Of course it's partly Kyrie and Lebron's fault for going ISO glory mode but I think the Warriors have a hand in it too. I mean we lost 3 in a row because we were forced to ISO. I might be wrong but that's what I believe.
I mean props to Golden State for their D too. Cavs could've played better but they only had a 2 point lead in one point in the 4th
JVG or Jackson pointed it out at the start of the 4th. Both Lebron and Kyrie were in, while Curry was getting rest.
First thing cavs did after losing was go in the locker room and watch replays of bron getting hit in the nuts?\n
https://twitter.com/vinephilly/status/741475547742638080
what did lebron and curry say to each other at the end?!
It's gonna be funny if Steph wins it at the Oracle with his 'Chef' shoes and shuts everyone up :')
I think Curry will embrace the shoe memes and turn them into a positive like Drake did w/ hotline bling 
Well Cavs fans, there's always next year to lose in the finals. 
Bron: Y'all think y'all got an open spot for me next year? \n\n[Curry: Boy if you don't get]( \nhttps://pbs.twimg.com/media/CkpB-5-VAAIxjxa.jpg:small)\n

Cavs fans left the game early to beat the trafic to get home and see who can burn Kevin Love's jersey the fastest
Any Cav fan that blames Love is stupid. He played hard but this series is just not good match up wise at all. 
Not his fault his only job in cleveland is to camp at the 3 point line lol
Lue is so bad lol 
Our 6th man is back! Thanks Kevin!
Actually they did a great job staying in their seats until the last minute.
I found it funny when Oracle had more people watching in Oakland than the Cavs had left in their stadium. Then they panned to the  outside view, and they all were there.
Crazy how the winning team tends to stick around longer\n
Was expecting Heat fans part two. Props Cavs fans!
Heat fans part two got a championship. Part three, as well.
they left early last year but thats none of my business 
I'm a supplanted Heat fan living in the Philly area. Philly fans leave every single game early. Except the Flyers fans.\n\nEvery fanbase has fans that leave early. 
he's saying they never got into the game. i.e. sitting down all game.
Some of them look like they haven't left their seat in years 
Ths Cavs team is a pale imitation of the 2010-14 Heat.
I just don't get the fourth quarter collapse 
Miami played championship defense when it needed to. The Cavs have too many dudes who are straight up defensive liabilities.
Just got word that Lue will bench LeBron after he gave him Vietnam-level PTSD with that step over Dray 
Lue looks terrible in this post game. \n\n"Lue, what did you see in so and so?"\n\n"Fuck if I know.  I gotta look at the tape."

Not the Larriors anymore !
In my head, I pronounce it as Law-riors. But, I can see Low-riors being another pronunciation.   \nFor the IPA efficient:  \n1. [l\xc9\x92-\xc9\xb9i\xc9\x9az] (Law-Riors)  \n2. [lo\xca\x8a-\xc9\xb9i\xc9\x9az] (Low-Riors)  \nEDIT: Maybe [l\xc9\x94-\xc9\xb9i\xc9\x9az] as a potential pronunciation ?  \nEDIT 2: Accidentally removed IPA of #1 and put it in the first edit. Also, I never considered the Larry-ors version. I guess there's that too.
Never again!
Free karma!
Regardless of we were rooting for tonight, I think we can all agree on one thing. \n\n**The refs were absolute trash tonight.**\n\nIt's one thing to call tick tacky fouls or to let the guys play, but it's another to be so incredibly inconsistent that no one playing in or watching the game knows what is or isn't going to draw a whistle. \n\nI'm not passing blame at all, I just feel like games at this stage of the NBA season deserve better officiating than what we received tonight. 
Smith goes right across Iggy's arms on the 3 pointer. No call, tech on Kerr.
What about the foul right before half time? It was bad, but equally bad for both sides. 
Amen
We need a ref lowlight video. It was atrocious.
For real. Not calling fouls is just bad officiating. Ugh. So ugly.
The officiating was fucking unacceptable. It's not like it's going to change. They kind of do what they want. 
https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CkO-iXJUgAAW0dQ.jpg
Anybody notice how the Cavs kinda gave up around the 6 minute mark in the fourth? That was weird. Crowd wasn't in it, players looked very uninterested... Just odd cuz they were only down 5.
Dead legs. No rest. Lue's fault.
This game shows clearly that Lebron cares more about stats padding than winning. Down 9 with 30 seconds left? Better go for the easy 2!
Implying LeBron can make clutch 3's in the finals. 
Barnes earned himself a max, tonight.
been clutch all season, let steph klay and dray do their thing, need to clinch it, barnes was there
As long as its not the Lakers then sure.
I'm starting to like draymond green. dude plays so hard
I'm not blind to all the dirty shit, but when the dude is on your team it's really hard to dislike him because he fucking hates losing.
Every team needs an asshole and he's Golden States. He doesn't give a fuck if you like him, he doesn't give a fuck if the crowd likes him, he doesn't give a flying fuck. He only cared about his team winning and that's why he's invualable, he won't let anyone walk over him and he'll foul you and piss you off to no end as long as it means winning. Dude may not be a sportsman but by God he's got the drive to win and amazing athleticism and that's why even if you don't like him you gotta respect him. This is a guy who won't even back down to LeBron, Draymond does not give a fuck and it's amazing. \n\n\n\n\nPlus he looks like a donkey. 
I watched him all season and never felt he was exceedingly dirty. The Adams thing was embarrassing, but honestly he didn't do stuff like that every night. He's mostly just a guy who plays with great passion, hustle, and intensity. Guys like this are frustrating to play against, but you love them when they're on your team. 
He's definitely a guy that you want on your team. He's a pure heart, energy guy. My only complaint would be that he set some shady screens this year. However, if you're continually getting away with it, why stop?
You\'re a brave man contradicting r/NBA\'s hive-mind. I\'d be willing to bet that within 20 minutes, there will be at least three "Fuck Draymond Green" comments.  
Nah man, you missed the tide turning. That was last week's /r/NBA.
I just can't seem to keep up with the trends
This sub literally switches narrative depending on who wins (Cavs lose, Warriors win = Lebron is a bitch and Draymond isn't). It's pretty bipolar. 
More like the people who like Draymond post more when he does well, and people who dislike him post more when he does poorly. Same with LeBron. Same with every team.
Fuck Draymond Green^played^hard^tonight
Now this i like
Dude is the most important player on the team
People that hate him try to make him out to be a fake(whether its his toughness or his game) but you have yet to see him cower when everything is on the line. He always steps up with his play. 
Seriously misguided if you think he went missing for the whole series. He had a couple bad games  but came through when it mattered. He plays hard every game, you are right.
So basically he went slightly lower than his season average(for the series) after having 2 bad games? You can hate the guy and I see that you do but calling him a spoiled douche is so far from the truth. You can call him a lot of terrible things but spoiled might not exactly be the right words. To each his own.
skill, talent and physically, he always seems to me like a "bootleg Lebron". But what makes him so effective, is that he works hard and he knows his strengths and focuses on that. Also helps that the pieces around him complement him perfectly.\n\nI think he could be a memorable great in the game at the end of his career, especially if this Warrior group stick together for a few more years.
I don't think there's anything fake about him, he's just a dick. 
Almost better than that, he's honest with himself when he does have a bad game, and owns up to it. He doesn't have much of a personal ego, seemingly. BUT Draymond seems to have an ego and arrogancy for the Warriors as a team. It's very interesting.
These fools don't know that Draymond will do literally anything for a win and prove doubters wrong. 
You can't question the guy's passion for the game.  I'd take that over someone phoning in a performance any day.
He's like Matthew Delladova, but actually good at basketball
Don't piss him off either, it just makes his defense better. 
**FUCK...DRAYMOND GREEN** played like a monster and almost got suspended for calling LeBron a little bitch.
2 techs or 1 flagrant
well Lebron isn't little.
[Special delivery for the Cavs](http://imgur.com/JPvPUR5)
Kevin Love is unbeaten in playoff games played in Cleveland, in which he has started.
If only for two days, we can finally not here about the Splash brothers (specifically Curry) looking not so splashy in the Finals.
I still remember when Steph got snubbed from an all star appearance a few years ago. Can't believe how things have changed since then tbh.
Fucking hell. This fully healthy Cavs team was supposed to at least give the Warriors a challenge and potentially win the fuckin' thing. What the hell is this. They gave the game away in the 4th and the ISO heavy tag tea of LeBron and Kyrie is really helping in that regard.\n\nYou'll get one some day Cleveland, just not now.
No, this full healthy Cavs team had a very small chance at giving the Warriors a challenge. After the 7 game series with OKC it was obvious that momentum was going to carry the Warriors all the way through this. Warriors in 5 was a very easy prediction to make. There was no way Cavs were going to win both games in Cleveland and it was very obvious that their Warriors were going to win their first 2 games at home.
And that's the series. Go Indians 
LeBron wants to get one for the land. \n\nLooks like this Cavs squad interpreted it as one win not one ring. 
It\'s all about getting tacos for the land!
Draymond turned Lebron into a raging little boy tonight, looked like he stole Bron Bron's candy.
Hey Cavs fans\n\nhttp://imgur.com/LfT1LnI
lol Cleveland
nope but yours is still the butt of every sports joke and won't win anything for a looooong time. Take this L
atleast we don't have a coach that looks like a fish
Atleast the bucks have a championship.

Varejao coming back to haunt the Cavs.
Golden State won this game with defense. Period.
Goddamn it. Goddamn it.
Thank You Warriors
All lebron had to do was talk to Guillermo
Lol, t lue bitching about the refs. They were god awful for both sides...
It's not overreacting at this point. It would be a miracle if CLE won 2 in a row at Oracle.
KLove should've played in the final 5 minutes when the Cavs were down nearly 10 points - it's the equivalent of pulling the goalie in hockey.  What they surrender in defense they make up for in offensive firepower.  I agree that he shouldn't have started - but his presence was missed down the stretch.
Kyrie may have been playing ISO in the fourth and taking contested difficult shots, but what else was he going to do? Nobody was cutting or setting off ball screens, LeBron looked like he didn't want to be there which is inexplicable. If you ask me out of the big three Kyrie was the only one who looked genuinely invested in the game right till the end, you could see it on his face. 
Draymond Green did Chernobyl
Big if true\n

Fuck you r/nba! -Steph Curry
Retweeted by Draymond Green. 
that's what you get for roasting my shoes
Not going to lie, Cav's sloppiness in the 4th quarter cost them the game. That and curry. 
Man I was getting hype just hoping that LeBron and Draymond Green would get into a fight towards the end.\n\nThen there were words between LeBron and Curry?!?! I was like " no! LEBRON HE\'S JUST A CHILD!"
When LeBron retires with a 2-Shitty Finals record I could see his 30 for 30 in 20 years being named "The King that never Reigned: A LeBron James story"
It's so great because the justice is straight up cosmic.

LeBron shouldn't have fired blatt 
OMG Lebron and Kyrie have never looked more like father and son than they do in this post game presser.
They should have traded Love a few months ago, they could have gotten a good package from say Boston.\n\nNow his value has hit rock bottom, whether LeBron wins a ship with Cavs will solely depend what they likely get with Love. They have the highest payroll in the league and are STARTING J.R and Jefferson. That is a catastrophe.\n\n
Fuck the Cavs.
Lebron is such a great teammate he spent the last 2 minutes padding his stats instead of trying to win \n\nLebron is so weak mentally he didn't attempt a single 3 while they were down and opted to protect his fg%\nOn top of that he didn't pass it to his teammates and took easy layups to pad his fucking stats\nWhat a fucking loser
He had his dumb fans to believe that empty stats.
He's done it his whole fucking career 
Right. But people won't see that when they look at his stats. Pathetic 
He's done this shit his whole fucking career\n\nPeople pull up his performances, he shot 50% though! He had 25 points though!!
After watching kobe no one really understands how maddening lebron is quite like we do
Only one of the two have heart and give it all to win \n
Watching Cleveland fail will never get old :')
Pretty neutral towards LeBron but seeing Cleveland suck in sports is a guilty pleasure of mine.
where the FUCK is mosgov? where the FUCK is delly? where the fuck is pipe man? there's no actual rotation\n\ni really, really hate to say it but we were better off with blatt. he wasn't the greatest coach but he at least tried to steer the team in the right direction. lue is just lebron's yes man.\n\nwe need a COACH, not a yes man
He was a decent coach and a good basketball mind.
Like stealing a taco from a LeBaby!!!

After watching that game, I\'ve come to the conclusion Lebron is the biggest chump in the NBA. Pushing down Draymond an putting your nuts in his face. If he had pushed you back you\'d be playing the victim like you always do.But don\'t worry I\'d be upset to if I was about to lose my FIFTH Finals series but you\'re considered "The King". That title belong to MJ! Are you gonna have another \xe2\x80\x9cDecision\xe2\x80\x9d Bron? Is it sad that YOU needed Wade to win your two rings? While Wade won one on his own? \xf0\x9f\x90\xb8\xe2\x98\x95\xef\xb8\x8f An I don\'t want Cavs fans to use the same excuse last year "Oh well we don\'t have Kyrie an Love but when they do we gonna beat them." There in the game but ain\'t doing shit. We\'re seeing a new dynasty coming together in front of our eyes. \n
Lol @ LBJ padding his stats at the end.  ESPN gonna eat that shit up and proclaim him the player of the game.
Nobody feels bad for LeBron. He chose this
Best game in the series so far excitement-wise, but I just want to point out, props to ABC/ESPN for not showing the douche that ran on the floor in the last minute. Fuck guys like them. 
Lebron quit on the team. Love is trash. Irving tried his best at the end but he just couldn't put it together. \n\nCavs will never win a championship.
2/7 confirmed!
He gets 34 from Kyrie, great team defense, his team protecting the ball (he had 7 of the Cavs 11 turnovers.) and a two point game going into the fourth. \n\nOnly to be outplayed by Andre Iguodala, imposing his frustrations on Stephen Curry & Draymond Green, and his only buckets being "stat padding time" buckets. \n\nBut yeah, tell me more about how this is okay because "Dis the greatest team in history, what dew u want?"
Are you out of you damn mind? \n\n1. This post has 0 to do with Stephen Curry. I'm a hypocrite when I didn't even mention the man?\n\n2. Yeah I remember Kobe in the 2010 Finals, I remember the 15 boards he crashed when his shot wasn't falling, I remember the 3/14 he held Ray Allen to, I remember how he still led the game in scoring. What I don't remember is him ever bitching at Rondo or Ray Allen when things looked bleak.\n\n3. Wade and Bosh could do nothing when LeBron struggled? Dwyane Wade averaged 27/7/5 my man, and Bosh averaged 19/7, both scoring more than James did. So I don't know what the hell you're talking about here.
I'm not sure if you're serious. But the entire Warriors team played like shit on Wednesday. \n\nThe Cavs today? Not so much. 
I've watched him get swept in 2007, score 8 on 3-11 shooting against the Mavs, get bailed out in 2013 by a miracle that he gets all the credit for, get annihilated in 2014, but this is to me his worst performance in the Finals. No heart, no hustle, and worst of all no brain. But most importantly, No. Excuses. It's enough. 
Lebron fans never fault him, they just move the blame around 
It's like we were waiting for a LeBron takeover that never happened.
But stat padding sure did happen 
Cavs MVP\n\nhttps://vine.co/v/iLuzZ1YlqOi
Lol that cavs offense is fucking atrocious. Thank god Lebron got his boy the head coaching gig!

holy shit...green is not LeBron's color...LMFAO
Lol, so much doubt in this thread.\n\nLook what happened, LeBron lead them from the depths of 3-1 series to a sweet victory for the city of Cleveland.\n\nI think this thread show how over reactive people can be some times.
For all the people who have NEVER REALLY PLAYED BALL.\n\nDraymond green is an amazing player. I know you are used to 2k and players being literally the product of complex algorithms but real players understand how to win and Dray just got into "THE KINGS" head and completely took him out of the game.\n\nI know I\'ll get down voted into oblivion but whatever at least I\'m not blind. 
He got into brons head and THEN, the game was over
he's a beast! only people who don't play ball hate him
Love flops like a bitch at the 3-point line, no comment from announcers.\n\nVarejao flops a little bit under the goal, announcers suddenly want fouls to be overturned by replay.
The Warriors gave Cleveland a win just so they could win it all at home.

Lebron looks like 2011 Lebron out there in losses. Turning the ball over left and right, unable to even hit his fucking free throws. \n\nhttp://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/2011-nba-finals-mavericks-vs-heat.html\n\nhttp://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/2016-nba-finals-cavaliers-vs-warriors.html \n\nFollow this bbref link when it updates. He already has as many turnovers as he did in 2011. He fluffed his stats this game. His jumper looks awful. It's just not great ball from him. He's passing up easy looks at the basket like he did in 2011 as well. He was in the right mindset during game 3, but idk I guess the defense got to him and he got a little jumpy.\n
When people cry that today's NBA is soft and they prefer the physical play of the 80s and 90s, direct them to this series.

bron probably wont get one for the land :/
Someone called Stephen curry a bitch in the Doris Burke interview. He looked nervous like he was ready to get outta town.
>AF\n\n>fasho\n\n>AF\n\n\n\nI don\'t see anything wrong with him shrugging these dudes off. Less about privelege and being in the hood and more about tactless fans being annoying. If I saw him I\'d probably be like "what\'s up dude, love watching you play" or some shit and move on. Not run up on the dude with my phone out yelling shit out like it\'s a worldstar video. Ghetto gas station or suburban neighborhood that kinda behavior is probably shrugged off the same way.\n\n
> He looked nervous like he was ready to get outta town.\n\nI've been to Cleveland, I don't blame him.
Sorry but if I'm a Cavs fan I'll be furious with Lebron and Kyrie's refusal to shoot the three at all in the final minute. I get that it's probably not going to make a difference but you try. Two treys and one good defensive possession and you're right there with a shot. The Warriors were completely keeping the lane open and LBJ/Kyrie went right into stat-padding mode.
will there be any excuses for why Warriors won title this year?
It will be LeBron didnt have enough help.
Overly healthy 
If Blake and CP3 hadn't gotten hurt they would have beaten the Blazers and then beaten the Warriors in round 2. Best I could come up with. \n\n
Love and Kyrie were too healthy
Cleveland and their "Believeland" shit lmao. Best believe you\'re losing in five.

Kevin Love never lost a playoff game while concussed and inactive 
Huge disappointment. Lue really let everyone down by letting the Cavs iso for so many possessions and leaving Love in. Terrible decisions. LeBron needs to sit earlier in the game or be a metric fuck-ton more decisive going to the rim. This half-ass driving looking for bail-outs hasn't worked for Westbrook his entire career, what makes you think it'll work for you, LeBron?
It\'s a world tailor made for you\n\nDoris couldn\'t have described Curry\'s public perception any better
The series is over. Ill eat nailsl If the cavs end up winning. WITH NO MILK.
**WHERE THE FUCK WAS MOZGOV?**
That 4th quarter was appalling. Warriors stepped up and we didn't. Simple as that. 
W-will Barkley be okay?
Theres so many things i dont understand about cavs game. Whole 4th quarter they're lazily jacking up 3s, against the best 3pt shooting team in history. And then only when they are down by 10 with 2 minutes left do they finally start driving to the basket... but are fouling Klay and Curry every possession to stop the clock, making it impossible to make up any ground. How could any of this possibly work? Im not coaching genius but I can fucking count, obviously the exact opposite should have been happening.\n\nI dont see why people are hating on Kyrie though. He and bron were the only ones who didnt appear to have completely given up 2 minutes into the 4th. 
Steph Curry is Regigigas confirmed, and 5 turns have apparently passed.
17/36 on 3-PT. dear lord
i laugh at ref call for a tech. of kerr at half time for the no call on the final shot. really a coach complaining and you call a tech. Ref. you miss a lot of calls and call that one. you guys suck.
1..Draymond \n2. Another game like Game 4 for Curry putting him just ahead 
Livingston seems to be playing pretty damn well. Or maybe Draymond?

This will probably get buried but I'm gay
xD he's homosexual so funny
Yes refs were terrible. Yes we really sucked in the 4th quarter, but I really have to hand it to GSW. I honestly thought we had this game coming into the 4th, and as a die-hard Cavs fan, I rarely have that feeling. Props, they absolutely shut us out at the end there.
http://i.imgur.com/VaoyqQb.png?1
Lebron has no shame in stat padding  
Curry is back in the Finals MVP race!
I think it's still Draymond, he had the Cavs rattled in the 4th.
http://m.imgur.com/xXoacMy.jpg
I regret clicking on that. I feel very uncomfortable now. 
There's gonna be a lot of blame on Love, but it was Lebron and Kyrie killing the Cavs' offense with hero ball from the end of the 3rd through the 4th.\n\nI think I counted 10 of 12 possessions in a row that were iso, before I stopped counting.
Watching bronbron try to goon it up and then pad his stats at the end in a loss was delicious.   Mmmmm. 
One of the worst officiated finals games ever. You can say they let both sides get away with everything, or they're letting them play, but I don't care - it makes the game so frustrating to watch. Call a foul if it's a foul regardless. Can't stand this officiating
That was not even basketball out there...it was a horribly called game...so many blatant missed calls.

TIL Brendan Haywood is a pretty good tv personality
Lebron's green suit totally made up for that loss tonight. 
I know there's a lot here to discuss with the way the stars played but I want to point out how completely bad ass Anderson Varejao few minutes were. The way he rebounded was a huge difference maker at a real critical point in the game.
Kyrie just seems to be missing something that would put him among the elite players in the NBA. What is it? Basketball IQ? Durability?
I mean y'all asked for this. The Chef delivered. 
Seems like the whole city of Cleveland was "All In," except for the Cavs
This is a LeBron hater's wet dream.
Where's all those Cavs fans that came out of their caves after game 3. The shit talking was hilarious. 
2016 is the year that Varejao wins an NBA championship.\n
Proof that the only way to win a ring is to leave Cleveland. 
GOD HATES CLEVELAND
LeBron won't ever be the GOAT until he can come through in the clutch. You'd think Kyrie was the one and only superstar on this team towards the end, with the amount of iso possessions he was taking. LeBron just can't score when it matters.
And this is why Kobe is still better than LeBron
Lakers fans always trying to shoehorn Kobe into everything :P\n\nNot that I disagree.
Meh, had a bunch of idiots i had to argue with earlier about it. Plus, shitposting is fun...especially when its the truth\n\nCheers
Don't see how anyone can even consider him for that title. Top 5? Sure. GOAT? It will always be MJ. Can't beat 6-0 with 6 finals MVPs and his ability to take over in the playoffs.
People in the future will look at the stats and go, look how efficient he was! But he basically did nothing in the 4th and garbage timed himself 6 points in the last 40 seconds.
He can, however, boost his stats in garbage time with easy dunks\n\nThe Bronsexuals s are ready to point to these sheets to say "if only his teammates performed!!!!1!"
Bro he decided to be selfish as fuck at the end of the game\n\n\nHe put his stat line over his team\n\nIn the fucking NBA finals 
No u ain't.. 
They are down 9 fouling curry and Thompson\n\nAnd he was taking layups and dunks\n\nHow is that trying to win?\n\nHe could have shot 3s or passed to jr 
it was over because he took those shots 
Yes he did exactly that. He knew the game was over, but instead of shooting threes, which is what he knew he needed to do. He did a bunch of angry dunks. Interesting. What does MVP mean again?
Thompson went HAM, and IMO Irving was Better than him today\n\nBut I know Lebron is great, but he was clearly frustrated by GSW defense tonight. I hate when the LeApologists think they only ever lose cuz of everyone but Lebron 
LOL i know that feeling bro, im almost doing an "NBA Memes" impression.\n\nI figure were all gonna be reactionary assholes anyways, might as well go with it

The Cavs didn't even go down fighting at the end. Instead Lebron took **layups**. I don't know what to think anymore.\n\nI fully expect Golden State to close this series out on Monday -- by **at least** 20.
 http://i.imgur.com/8vdJr8Q.jpg 
but reddit told me they sucked and curry was a bum now\n
Cleveland has 0 depth. It is literally Lebron and Kyrie carrying the team.....and usually individually. God Damnit Love, you had one fucking job!\n\nCould you imagine if CP3 was on the Cav's. That work ethic alone would be huge. 
Maybe Space Jam 2's plot is that LeBron lost his jumpshot and he needs Bugs and his friends' help to get it back.\n\nMaybe they are already doing the film?
Does anyone have a gif of Igoudala stiff arming someone?
Does anyone else think maybe they realized they couldn't hit jumpers so they were going for layups with lots of contact for and-1s but just wouldn't get calls.
Its over. Lebron 2-5 in the finals lol
Cavs 0-3 in finals. 
I am getting hit, but the refs aren\'t seeing it that way - Lebron\n\nstay classy, there were no calls on both sides of the ball. Major ones. 
Kevin Love lost Cleveland this game when he got continually bitched by Anderson Fucking Varejao. I couldn't believe what I was watching. \n\nLeBron also shrinked and got frustrated towards the end. Can't see how the cavs can win game 5 let alone the series. 
My semi unbiased take on the game:\n\n1. The refs were absolute trash, inconsistent on both ends of the floor and really let the game get out of their control. I was seriously surprised there wasnt a double tech on Lebron and Green during their scuffle.\n\n2. Cavs absolutely lost this game in the 4th, Lue was absolute trash by letting them run iso plays and trying to play hero ball and playing Lebron and Kyrie nearly the entire second half. Also, what was he thinking by having Frye out there with Kyrie trying to guard Curry off the pick??? Golden State played a semi solid game (mainly because the refs just messed up the entire game so badly). Steph Curry is a great player and you certainly should NOT let him get free off of those picks. Klay Thompson also had a solid performance. \n\n3. Lebron just looked so much less aggressive than he should have. He didn't have a bad game by all means, he nearly had a triple double, however, he has TOO MANY TURNOVERS (to quote the 2k15 coach).\n\nOverall, I think this game was hard to watch for both fans due to how horrid the officiating was. I still hope my Cavs can win it, but both the players and Lue need to get their shit together. Congrats to GS on the win. Like I said, this was an extremely poorly officiated game on both ends so there is no reason we should be acting like the refs acted in favor of one team over the other.
KEVIN LOVE IS UNDEFEATED WHEN HE DOESN'T PLAY IN THE GAME.
What a boring finals at his point might as well let it be over. great season in the nba too bad it has to end on a low note
Once again all I notice is how LeBron will drive hard to the rim and kick the ball back out. He also has multiple times matched up with Curry and still wants to pass the ball. At some point someone has to tell LeBron to take over when he can easily get his way. Too much facilitation in the finals on his part. 
I think everyone is forgetting that Love has now lost a game in Cleveland 
Not when in the starting lineup! 
TACOS MOTHA FUCKAS!!!!!!
LeBitch showed his true colors tonight.
Lebron " Fuck you, I\'m the greatest. Fuck your weakass team"\nCurry "Check the score board"
Definitely. It's just kind of maddening if you're a Cavs fan (maddeningly hilarious if you're an outside observer) that they actually probably had a demonstrably ***better*** formula for matching up against them, and ended up completely shooting themselves in the foot by trading away a player they could desperately use right now in exchange for somebody that, honestly, I can't imagine they even want on the court. They literally paid out the nose so they could downgrade.\n\nBut hey, wouldn't be Cleveland otherwise!
LeBron was a giant bitch the entire game. Kyrie and LeBron disappeared in the 4th quarter. The Cavs shot 15 for 26 from the free throw line and Cavs fans want to blame the refs for the loss. Curry is backed. League is fucked. Warriors repeat in 5.
[Cleveland in the second half](http://imgur.com/0OY2Yu0) NSFW
LOL Lebron stat padded so hard at the end. Makes it look like he had a good game even though he played mediocre.
Every player is different, but I personally do believe in the notion that LBJ doesn't have the same killer mentality that lifted MJ and Kobe to greatness. LBJ seemed to pass off when he had great opportunities to drive to the rim a little too much in this game and G1, in my opinion. But LBJ is his own man... he dominates in his own way, whether it's with that killer mentality or not.
The Cleveland Cavaliers just beat the Cleveland Cavaliers tonight. Up by 8 in the third, losing that lead then resorting to ISO ball playing right into GS hands. Pathetic 
Lol fuck LeBron. He can't step over anyone when down 1-2 and down in the game. Green earned so much respect from me by walking away when it was so obvious LeBron was goading him.
Kevin Love is still undefeated at home in the post season as a starter
James Michael McAdoo has not lost an NBA Finals game
Really loser this series is my liver
Lebron's ultra stat padding is the main reason i don't take the idiots reciting his finals counting stats seriously\n\nwhat a joke of a performance 
Personally I think it's silly as hell to say this Warriors team can beat the showtime Lakers.\n\nBut 20 years from now in 2K36, you can be damn sure that this 73-9 team will be featured as one of the classics.
TristanThompson underrated by Lue; Keving Love overrated by Lue.\n\nDelly underrated by Lue; Irving overrated by Lue.
As good as the first half was the second half was a complete shit show.
Checked LeBron stats and didn't even notice he was doing so much. \n\n* 25pts (don't look at this though. Around 6 added from the stat padding time) \n\n* 13reb\n\n* 9ast\n\n* 2stl\n\n* 3blk\n\nStill wasn't enough though. I wish he aimed to score instead of obviously pass during the earlier quarters. \n\nIt does kinda seem that he's getting the Shaq treatment. Some of his drives looked like he was getting hacked but the lack of close ups make it unclear. \n\nAt least it was a close game compared to the first 3 games. Refs were terrible on both sides though. 
I guarantee you didn't watch the game right? He looked like shit out there. He had 18 points before padding his stats in the last minute. Stop with the bullshit foul excuses. 
B-But this team was the chosen one! They were healthy this time! THEY WERE SUPPOSE TO DESTROY THE ~~SITH~~ WARRIORS! NOT CEMENT THEIR LEGACY AS THE GREATEST TEAM OF ALL TIME.
LeBron: "Boy free up some cap space so I can join ya\'lls squad next season."\nCurry: "Hell naw mayne gtfo with that bs."
Iggy
the only series the cavs big 3 have lost is with 2 of the 3 out lol. nice narrative.
I don\'t know how anyone can watch that game and still say that the "series is rigged". The officiating was awful on both sides, and it still then favored the Cavs. LeBron gets away with fouls on multiple possesions and doesn\'t get punished or thrashed by the commentators/social media for pushing Draymond to the ground and then stepping over him. If Draymond does that, he\'s being ridicudled by ESPN, Reddit, Twtitter, etc. Just yet again shows that LeBron gets this insane cushion from the refs. 
Lebron should have been patient and stayed with Miami. He still would have made the finals, and would probably have beaten the warriors last year..Let's not pretend that Riley would have gotten them the players the need. Now he has handcuffed himself, and since he will never bring a trophy to Cleveland, his career will be seen as a loser that couldn't do it without another player that if not better, but at least his equal (D-Wade).\n\nHis finals performance have also been extremely poor. There is the series against Mavericks that will always be in the back of his mind and something that lebron haters love to bring up, and now this series, where it is painfully obvious his game has fallen off a cliff. Maybe it really is mental, or he just doesn't have the physical tool that made him a beast from 2010-2014. But clearly his time has passed. \n\nIMO, he needs to take a year off from the finals, maybe lose in the 2nd or 3rd round next season, and come back with a fresh mentality, and a fresher body. No way the cavs are winning with how great the Warriors are.  
empty stats. he made 0 difference in the game tonight. Cleveland needs him to be Jordan, and not chris paul. 
Lebron with the game low +/-, 7 TOV, usual 40% shooting (stat padded near the end) and an epic missed clutch free throws to lose the game. his empty counting stats and bad defense exposed. \n\n\n"Best player in the game" lmao\n\n"Top 5 all time" nahh\n\n2/7 confirmed\n\n/r/nba teenager army going to sleep crying tonight 
I seriously hate this sub. LeBron is a hero after game 3, everyone loves him, he\'s the GOAT..  but now that game 4 is over lebron is a bitch.\n\nWas he frustrated in game 4? Hell yeah he was and it was visible, but that doesn\'t change his fucking career\'s work. How can you praise a man 2 days ago, but now he\'s just a bitch?\n\nAnd is curry god again now? Or are we still gonna call him overrated like after games 1-3?\n\nLeBron is great, Curry is great. Individual games don\'t change this. They both are and will always be amazing, once in a lifetime players. Everyone bashes the media for their "hot takes" but this sub is the biggest offender.
They're not the same people 
Lmfao cavs fans so cocky before the game. Now they're team can go back to being losers. And to top it all off they live in fucking Ohio.\n\nChoke is real. 
Weren't the Cavs the favorites at the start of the regular season for whatever reason?
So losing to arguably the greatest team of all time is "choking"?

Unpopular opinion (maybe): My thoughts on this would've been the same no matter the result but I loved the officiating tonight. As a fan, I've been praying for a taste of old school basketball and tonight we got exactly that. Undoubtedly there were missed calls but the refs letting both teams get physical and not automatically blowing a whistle anytime a guy drove hard into the paint was a breath of fresh air. The chippiness of the whole game provided an unbelievably tensed atmosphere that hasn't happened too many times recently. I loved it and hope it continues past these Finals.
This wasn't old school basketball. This was occasionally letting the game get out of hand and occasionally calling weak fouls, with no consistency. 
Idk why but people have a super distorted view of old basketball
Totally agree, they would call stupid shit but then let guys whack each other in the face

Guess he deserves it now.
No team has come back from 3-1 in the finals.\n\nWarriors most likely just won back to back Championships.\n\nAfter setting the record for wins.\n\nAnd coming back from 3-1 themselves in the WCF. They are one of the top two teams ever in the history of the NBA.\n\nGive it up haters, and show some respect. You are witnessing historic greatness.
are you being sarcastic because it's absolutely atrocious and we're all hating on him for it
Kevin Love hasn't lost a playoff game in Cleveland that he started!

7 finals appearances is amazing. I don't blame him for the losses.\n\nBut to be fair, his jumper does suck. For GOAT consideration you have to take that into account. It's affecting his ability to take over games because they just sag off him.
Salty
Look at the FT difference 
> Call me a hater all you want\n\nHater
Your mad go home
If Melo cared he'd have picked a contender 
Warriors coming back from a 3-1 defecit wasnt exciting?
So angry cause dubs are owning your teams.
downvoting a fellow Cavs fan, it's over brother.
series isn't over until the series is over. r/nba with the great insight
You know, people reference this all the time but not many know the circumstances behind it. Lakers were up in the second half of Game 7. Writers submitted their votes early before the end of the game. Celtics came back and won but the votes couldn't be taken back.\n\nWest wouldn't have won if the writers had just waited a little bit longer to vote 
Its called teamwork, look it up. 
Dude, just shut the fuck up. 
I don't.
