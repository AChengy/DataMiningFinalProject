Oh Jesus his amnesia\'s kicked in. No Kevin, you\'re not fine, you\'ve been in a terrible accident. You\'re gonna have to sit out the rest of the series I\'m so sorry. We\'ll do what we can to get you the therapy you need.\n\n"But I can reme..."\n\n"... OH GOD HE\'S HAVING FLASHBACKS TIE HIM DOWN"

Kevin Love's concussion tests will be solving rubix cubes one handed while playing concert level piano with the other hand sitting on a unicycle.

Spelling Bee in Chinese, to be exact.
Straight horizontal line at top for 5cm into 45 degree diagonal line down and to the right for 3cm into straight vertical line on the right side 3cm....
Actually Chinese characters are made up of a formal order of preset strokes each with their own name, so you would just list each of the strokes.

ooh pretty
declining athleticism\n\n"LeDecline"\n\nOkay.
Actually I think if you look at [this pic](http://i.imgur.com/2LDxUNW.png) you can see that he's lost a lot of lift.
yeah, he was more athletic than this before. still a brilliant athlete, but not as brilliant as in his 20s.
His athleticism is declining and so is he. The fact that he's still this athletic and is still so good just shows how insane he was before\n
His athleticism is like his stat sheet. He so frequently does the incredible that it quickly began looking normal to people. Lebron wasn\'t in the league very long before the reaction to his insane athleticism turned from "oh my god, how is that possible." to something like "oh, Lebron did something insane again, neat."
it's more evident in his lack of quickness from a standstill. he still gets up in transition for dunks though

it doesnt even look real
Holy shit the origin of Lelbron.
is it really?
It is indeed.
We are not worthy...
We're so used to that face being shopped, it doesn't look real anywhere.
ah, i understand why he's getting paid millions of dollars to do this now. 
I was wondering what made him different from me
Big, if true
And let that be a lesson to you all. Nobody beats the Cavs 8 times in a row.
That was literally the joke.
Chicago beat Cleveland 10 times in a row between 2010 and 2012 ;)
10 isn't 8 now is it Mr. Smart Guy?
Technically correct, the best kind of correct
Hey fuck you!
Warriors for sure gonna let Harrison Barnes walk this summer for that hit on Kevin Love
It was a joke. For taking out K Love and thus making the Cavs better. Wasn't sure if you got what he was saying. lol
Not good enough, Sonya.
They can't afford that max contract ass anyway
Is Barnes really going to get a max deal? I know his max is considerably less than someone like lebron or KD, but damn, Harrison Barnes getting a max? I feel like he's been a huge disappointment in the NBA but he's just found a niche on the dubs right now. I feel like he's on the same level as Jeff Green and there's no way in hell Jeff Green gets a max deal.
i don't understand contracts anymore and i feel like in a few years we will look back on some really bad deals this year. it's like ww1 too much firepower and no idea how to use it.
He doesn't *deserve* a max deal, but he'll get one. The money is so crazy nowadays, someone's gonna be willing to pay.\n\nPlus, with the huge new TV deal, and the salary cap going up soon, *and* because 50% of the NBA revenue has to go the players, some teams are gonna have so much money coming in while being so far under the cap that they'll essentially get penalized for spending *too little* money. So, if you you have money that you HAVE to spend, why not throw it at a max deal to ensure you get the player you want? Sure, you're technically overpaying him, but you'll take a hit if you don't spend that cash, so there's no reason to pay him less. \n\nIt's just how the NBA is going nowadays, there's literally more money than the league knows what to do with. 
>...there's literally more money than the league knows what to do with.\n\nOh I don't know...maybe lower ticket prices?  But I'm just spit ballin' here.  
Don't ticket prices have to do with supply and demand? Besides, it's been proven that lowering ticket prices won't help the common man since the vast majority are bought up by professional scalpers and sold at market price anyways.
If they  really gave a fuck they'd put mechanisms in place to curb that
For teams that sell out sure.  But for some other teams, who I see no need to name here, they should lower their prices just to get people in buying concessions.  But they don't want to embarrass themselves with 99\xc2\xa2 tickets.
Kevin Love is about to make history as the first player on a winning team to ever be Crying Jordan'd
thats not true at all
Klove is gonna need some love after this game. He feels left out.
Stop trying to feel left out and just feel left in
http://imgur.com/VT9O1HE
Crying jordan is always funny lol 
Memes don't die
Let me shitpost here for the moment
Remember kid, there's heroes and there's memes. Heroes get remembered but memes never die, follow your heart kid, and you'll never go wrong.
Love don't shine in the game. 
LeBron don't really go away
And that's just the game
i legit feel so bad for him. Mark Jackson with his "with due respect" shit again and then openly shitting on him was so sad. Imagine Kevin just watching the game and you hear that.
Its like every time I hear Mark Jackson talk, I hate him more and more.. I completely understand why the Warriors management didn't want to deal with that guy.
What did Mark Jackson actually say? I wasn't able to watch the game and couldn't find out via a quick Google search. Thanks 
I remember him saying something like "with Love out, Warriors don\'t play Bogut and Cavs defense improves by a long shot"
It's not like it isn't true, anybody watching these finals could tell you that
He's not wrong though. And people were saying that even before this game. The Cavs were a lot better defensively without Love in last year's finals as well. It's no secret that Love isn't a great defender.
He\'s straight trash.. with all due respect
I still can't believe I read a NYT article about the crying Jordan meme, what a time to be alive.
link it my dear cunty
http://mobile.nytimes.com/2016/06/04/arts/crying-jordan-the-meme-that-just-wont-die.html
For real, this meme has been around for a few years, which in meme years is like a fossil.

Ayesha Curry watching this game [like](http://i.imgur.com/z1cnGHb.jpg)
Those concussion symptoms are really affecting his vision
The starters:  \n\n* James 32 PTS, 11 REB, 6 AST, 1 STL, 2 BLK, +24\n* Thompson 14 PTS, 13 REB, 2 AST, +21\n* Irving 30 PTS, 4 REB, 8 AST, 1 STL, +24\n* Smith 20 PTS, 4 REB, 1 AST, +33\n* Jefferson 9 PTS, 8 REB, 2 AST, 2 STL, +11
>8 assists \n\n> selfish, not a point guard \n\nKyrie "Westbrook" Irving \n\n\nEdit : of course Westbrook is better 
Westbrook has the same defensive flaws as Kyrie actually. He relies too much on athleticism and instinct. He is constantly out of position and ball watching in hopes of stepping into the passing lane. Both have slow feet in picks and suffer tracking off ball movement.\n\nNeither are good defenders, but Westbrook certainly has better court vision and shot creation for teammates. Complete agreement. Kyrie has the better jumper though.
Kyrie's younger tho
He's missing 8 more boards to be a Westbrook 
jesus everyone was hot today
They played out of their minds. Warriors defense could not keep up. AND the Cavs played lights out defense. Damn.
Cavs backs were against the wall, this was the game they needed play to win. There were two moments during the game where us making 2 points after 5 minutes felt like a consolation prize. 
Yeah, I think Curry was injured too.
Clearly tonight Steph was only at 70%
same can be said about game 1 & 2 cavs misses tbh but we'll just see what happens next
Everytime the warriors lose someone says this
Cavs defense was smothering tonight man. Y'all tripping. Did you watch all those blocked shots and forced turnovers in the first half? 
Severe dropoff in the number of backdoor cuts and second chance tips GS was getting in the first two games, but yeah the Cavs didn't play good D.......\n\nThose dudes are nuts.
Plus so many Warriors possessions ended in a forced shot with the shot clock winding down. Great defensive effort by the Cavs. 
Lmao I can recognize a swarming defense when I see it. Were there shots that Warriors could have made? Yeah of course, but Cavs closed out on a lot of open looks.
And that's how they should defend from now on. The Pistons played their best defence against LA back in 2004, every damn game.
The only thing is that the Cavs starters were playing a lot of minutes throughout the first three quarters. I wonder if they could keep it up over a seven game series. OKC got really worn out towards the end there and it definitely seemed like a factor in them not being able to close out games 6 and 7. 
> Jefferson 9 PTS, 8 REB, 2 AST, 2 STL, +11\n\nHoly shit somebody's gonna eat a shirt!
that dunk tho, like dude is 36 and he can still do that?
This is him last year with the mavs.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45_Z4Qv_C0I
that's bullshit they called an offensive foul on that...everyone knows the rule is you only call the offensive foul if the player doesn't finish on the dunk!
RJ was freakishly athletic in his prime. I remember him leaping entirely over another player to block a shot at Arizona.\n\nEdit: I just assume things from back then don't exist, but [here it is.](http://youtu.be/exH_fnZ_j7o)
I also like how he looks exactly the same as he did 15 years ago
Those nets back in the day with jkidd throwing lobs to Kmart and Rj. Fond memories. 
Kobe once jumped over lamar odom to block a guy, but last time i saw him he only got off the ground a few inches. Don't sleep on father time.
Kobe also started playing in the league when he was 17. Think it was Bill Simmons that once wanted to coin a stat for number of jumps a player has made in their career to measure wear and tear. Kobe's probably like 50,000 jumps clear of second place on that list. 
yeah I remember those Net's teams, he always had big dunks. BUT HE OLD NOW. 
Yeah, same thing with Iggy, though. They don't have crazy athleticism now, just athleticism.
Oh, darn. Sucks to be them. Amirite?
oh wait they\'re good - /r/nba
Not just \\r\\nba, but pretty much the entirety of everybody. I knew the cavs were no way going to go down like a lil puss ass ninny. LeBron's too hungry. 
Seriously, the amount of people who were convinced this was gonna be an embarrassing sweep was ridiculous. Maybe it comes from personal experience of giving up way too soon but NBA teams don't work like that
Series begins when a team wins a road game. 
The three days between games two and three were the worst I've ever seen on r/NBA. 
The reports of the Cav's death were greatly exaggerated.
Nah today the Warriors were playing in the East. Think about it.
The East is weak confirmed?
The East is weak? The fuckin' East is weak? *You're weak.*

jordan face
LeBron James - First of his name. Receder of hairline. Tripler of doubles. Distributor of rocks. Discarder of headbands. Warden of Akron and one true heir to the throne of Mad King Dan.
Burn them all, the king kept saying. "Burn them all." I don\'t think he expected to die. He meant to burn with the rest of us and rise again reborn as a Heat and turn his enemies to ash. I slit his throat to make sure that didn\'t happen. That\'s where Ser Charles found me.\n\nBark. You think the honorable Charles Bark wanted to hear my side? He judged me guilty the moment he set eyes on me. By what right does the Sun judge the Warrior? By what right?\n\n\'Help! Help! The Kingslayer!\'... Steph. My name is Steph.\n\nSteph of House Oaklandister, father of Threeyion.\n\n(this doesn\'t look as awesome after tonight\'s game though haha)
I would have gone Warden of the East since that's [an actual thing](http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Warden_of_the_East) and since he's won in so many ECFs. \n\nBut I like it.
Won so many ECFs\n\n*hello darkness my old friend*
> Warden of Akron\n\nAh yes, the Joel Anthony of the Cavaliers.
I would like "Tripler of doubles"
Gotchu, fam.
Tripler of doubles is my favourite bartender

Looks like Lebron's legacy will survive impossible standards for at least ~~three~~ two more days.
To be fair when your discussed with jordan,  magic, bird, the standards ought to be pretty fucking high.
I have a screenshot of a guy upvoted to 90+ for saying LeBron was jealous of Curry lol this sub is incredible\n\nEdit: For everyone asking here's the screenshot.\nhttp://imgur.com/eL0xBi8
I'd bet serious reddit gold there's GSW flair involved\n\nEDIT: Technically correct, pay up /r/nba

Are u serious? Send me that screenshot bro

I can't believe a thread like that exists here
Post Game threads have some of the most idiotic reactions I've ever seen. Next day threads are way better. 
Give it time. They'll be meme fest overreactions soon
Earlier this week, I got into an argument with /u/J-E-G-V-L who argued that the Minnesota Timberwolves were in a better place than the Cavs right now. Then I stopped and thought *Wait, what am I doing?* 
>Yet 77 other people upvoted my original statement...you're beginning to look a tad bitter.  \n\nThese were your words when I disagreed with you. Now I'm at 171 and you're at -16. So what does your logic tell you now?   \n\nI use different logic: don't say stupid shit and you won't get called out in front of the whole sub later. 
A lottery team in a better place than a finals team...lol. I get in it with that dude in cbb, not any better. 
You were in an argument with /u/J-E-G-V-L who argued that the Minnesota Timberwolves were in a better place than the Cavs right now
If you go back and look at their argument it's pretty funny.  /u/J-E-G-V-L seems to think that the more upvotes you get, the more correct you are
Upvotes are popular opinion. Slavery was popular opinion not to long ago. Does that mean slavery was ever right?
Dude was butt hurt. I gave him an extreme example of Popular Opinion not being right.
Yeah ikr. I got in an arguement with someone who said Kobe is better than Lebron because he had more rings, but Robert Horry was not better than Kobe although he had more rings. I dont even know how the hell he got upvoted. Delusional Lakers fans I guess
Clearly the consensus GOAT is Bill Russell, and Frank Ramsey would crush MJ one-on-one
I explained to this other fanboy that Lebron was better because he had more assists, rebounds, steals, blocks, MVPs, had a higher shooting percent, and carried worse teams to the finals.\n\nHis factual and deep analysis heavy response? "Go suck Lebrons dick"\n\nGuess who got upvoted. Thanks r/nba...
Of course. The crowd changes daily.
This right here. Shit gets toxic, and I tend to take a few days off after a playoff loss. Then when the Cavs win, we all come out of the fucking woodwork while GSW fans sink a bit. That's most of what that is. Fans - I'd guess - don't really like hanging out and reading about their team getting shit on, so the Cavs fans aren't downvoting shit like that as much, because we're not in the threads as much when they lose.
Very good point. When it gets down to two teams, it\'s like fan bases take turns running /r/nba and then when the other team wins again, they come back and look around saying, "This is what /r/nba thinks! They\'re all stupid, obviously", and then proceed to do the very same thing the first team was doing.
This is the truest thing said about /r/nba 
Big if true
This is the truest thing said about Reddit.
So true.
So did Lebron and the Cavaliers in general just wake up this morning and decide that they actually want to compete for the championship? Serious note, excellent shooting performance from the Cavaliers.
This is why\n\nhttp://www.newyorker.com/humor/borowitz-report/cavs-replace-all-in-slogan-with-quote-from-jean-paul-sartre
Home court is sometimes a deciding factor\n
One of the Warriors fans on my Twitter feed said in all seriousness that the Warriors were likely paid to throw the game to extend the Finals and make it more exciting
It was a painful game to watch as a warriors fan but after that monster alley-oop to James I had to concede that the Cavs were playing some damn good basketball. 
The one after he fucking tripped? 
It's game 3.  There's the KD curse, the Cleveland curse, and the Warriors game 3 curse.
No Lil B Harden curse?
It's just the Lil B curse; it has no preference and can strike whomever the based god wants\n
KD said he was a wack rapper
I don't want to go too crazy overreacting but Richard Jefferson is the greatest player to step foot on a basketball court 
RJ was the man in NJ back in the day.
Richard Jefferson's foot is the greatest court to ever step on a player.
His Snapchat deserves a max contract 
At this rate Kevin Love is never clearing the concussion protocol. 
If the cavs pull out this series he should get finals mvp
Nah give it to Barnes for getting him there
No, that would go to Harrison Barnes' Elbow.
Kevin Love: "Hey guys I\'m feeling a lot better, I\'ll be back Game 4."\n\nCavs: "New phone, who dis"

This is the fucking ugliest picture I've ever seen.
*"Ayyy Kev why don\'t you take a 3 day weekend and rest that head"* - Tyronn Lue
Kev, buddy? We're just gonna be safe and rest ya for the rest of the finals, ok?
I\'ve finally finished mourning my Thunder, so I\'ve decided to do more write-ups in honor of the Finals. But I hadn\'t seen enough of the Cavs playing to make honest and informed critiques. Thankfully, I get to do that on a Cavs game that wasn\'t a total wash! Notes:\n\n* We\'ll start with the coaching. I honestly think Kerr got severely outcoached by James this round. Kidding. But seriously, Lue was much improved tonight. I\'m not sure if it was the home court getting guys comfortable in their game again, but I saw much improved switching, communication on both ends. He finally got his guys ready to play. \n\n* Kerr\'s coaching was also improved. He was prodding and tinkering to see how Lue would react. Unfortunately, there\'s no real adjustment to shots falling. That being said, he did a lot in order to see Steph getting a little in his groove after halftime. Backcuts off baseline screens and lots of curling, while using Livingston dropping to the elbow as a magnet for guards is pretty ingenious. \n\n*  Speaking of Steph, he took a while to wake up. Like 2.5 quarters. Yeah his shot started falling, but if you look more closely, you saw him getting a lot of the offball asswhooping that he got playing OKC. Bumping, prodding, checking, slapping, pushing: all of it seems to get him out of his rhythm and firmly into his own way. And when he\'s in his own way, like so many other greats, that\'s when he seems mortal. Taking that long in the Finals cannot happen. \n\n* I was really impressed by both Draymond and Klay. It\'s a shame that Dray is probably a shoe-in for the FMVP if the Warriors win, because Klay has been doing that thing all series where he singlehandedly puts the team on his back and hits stupid, ill-advised, JR Smith caliber shots at an insane clip. \n\n* That\'s not to belittle Draymond\'s game: he\'s been very good defensively. Notice that once he was no longer guarding LeBron, his jumper started falling again. Hopefully thats a causality that Lue looks into, but I don\'t have the analytics in front of me. \n\n* I hate to make another OKC comparison, but I have to--the Cavs finally brought their defense. More importantly, they used that defense to create offense, letting fast breaks come out of shattered posessions on the other end. Smart, and simultaneously breaks their overrealiance on iso-sets, and Kyrie playing off the dribble against Iggy/Livingston/Klay. \n\n* List of teams of fans that I saw trashing LeBron: Bulls (stop it), Dubs (expected), Nuggets (stop it again), Lakers (Boi). Cut the malarky, people. \n\n* List of teams of fans that I saw trashing Steph: OKC (guys...), Bulls (stop it again), Cavs (expected), Lakers (leave), Pistons (#fuckReggie). \n\n* Iman Shumpert looks like Huey Freeman, if Riley shaved his head in his sleep, and then he said "fuck it" and made a samurai bun out of the nappy ass remains. \n\n* I really think JR\'s regression is a direct result of that burn he got Game 1. He\'s not wearing the bandage, and suddenly he\'s slinging pipe and sipping Hennesey during timeouts. Coincidence? I think not. \n\n* Igoudala is probably one of the most underrated fucking defenders I\'ve ever seen. Seriously. Watch him work. He has Pippen caliber hands, he\'s remarkably aware of his own body in space, his timing is (terrifyingly) better than Draymond\'s, and he knows how to use his weight, and how to balance it to avoid fouling.\n\n* I know it\'s not smart to use singular events to make decisions, but honestly, Jefferson might need to start, the same way Kerr hasn\'t been afraif to start Igoudala. His defense has been magnificent, his heart has been great, and his PnR switches are nothing to shake a stick at. \n\n* Bogut was a bit of a liability tonight. Not tremendous, in my opinion, because at least he wasn\'t getting stupid fouls, but he was getting handled on the boards, and was slow to get back. Last game\'s block party has been shut down by Officer Thompson. \n\n* Tristan Thompson had a fantastic game. Still not worth 80m\'s though. Sorry. Had to be said. \n\n* Harrison Barnes plays games like there\'s a combo meter in his brain that fills up with good plays, and when it fills up, he wins a max contract. \n\n* Pop Quiz: Who is the best two way player in th-- LeBron. The answer is LeBron. If you said Klay, or Dray, or anyone else, welcome to the Mark Jackson School of Half-Baked Analysis. \n\n* LeBron time. Honestly, LeBron\'s biggest problem is that he makes it look easy. We don\'t compare him to his peers, we compare him to the likes of Jordan and Kobe and the Big O. Yeah he\'s lost 4 times in the Finals--because he\'s good enough to get there 7 times, 6 consecutively. That\'s more than your franchise. Damn sure more than my franchise. He\'s averaging damn near a triple double AGAIN, and we say he needs to step up. And he did, by bringing back his jumper, while making players quiver on the other end. \n\n* Kevin Love is a top 5 player at his position, and I hope he heals from his concussion without adverse effects. It is a shame to not be able to play in the Finals and have to be left with "What ifs", especially 2 years in a row. \n\n* Homecourt this year has been absolutely monstrous for teams. For anyone who says shit like "regular season doesn\'t mean anything" I promise you wish your team had more home games in a series this year. I know we do. \n\n* Trapping was magnificent on the Cavs side, while the Dubs were great switching and digging through screens. \n\n* Props on both teams for their mental toughness: GSW didn\'t get lazy. Cavs didn\'t come out softer than Twinkie filling. Props all around. \n\nThe Cavs are finally looking like who we thought they\'d be, while the Dubs are still capable of making a 20+ point deficit look tiny. Next game will determine if this was an aberration or not, for both teams. Only time will tell. We got a series, folks!\n\nP.S. On some folks suggestion I\'ll post an amended and updated version in the NDT tomorrow. \n
> We'll start with the coaching. I honestly think Kerr got severely outcoached by James this round. Kidding. But seriously, Lue was much improved tonight. I'm not sure if it was the home court getting guys comfortable in their game again, but I saw much improved switching, communication on both ends. He finally got his guys ready to play.\n> \n\nHe's always had the plays and ability. Playing at the Q forces the issue and makes the players see what they're playing for. LeBron also flashed his dick at the Q once, so it's a great home court.\n\n>Kerr's coaching was also improved. He was prodding and tinkering to see how Lue would react. Unfortunately, there's no real adjustment to shots falling. That being said, he did a lot in order to see Steph getting a little in his groove after halftime. Backcuts off baseline screens and lots of curling, while using Livingston dropping to the elbow as a magnet for guards is pretty ingenious.\n>\n\nHe still needs to respond to Tristan Thompson and Kyrie Irving's High Pick and Roll. It's so effective, and has worked extremely well throughout the series, either by freeing Kyrie to crash to the basket or take a midrange gimme shot, or by transitioning the ball to LeBron on the strongside to iso in a great position. \n\n>Speaking of Steph, he took a while to wake up. Like 2.5 quarters. Yeah his shot started falling, but if you look more closely, you saw him getting a lot of the offball asswhooping that he got playing OKC.

And when he's in his own way, like so many other greats, that's when he seems mortal. Taking that long in the Finals cannot happen.\n>\n\nIt's not so much the shot wasn't falling -- he got some great steals and his head was in the game. I think the issue is that he wasn't willing to just go balls to the wall and consume usage, and when he passed off to other teammates, they were immediately swarmed. He was played exactly as LeBron was in Game 2\n\n>I was really impressed by both Draymond and Klay. It's a shame that Dray is probably a shoe-in for the FMVP if the Cavs win, because Klay has been doing that thing all series where he singlehandedly puts the team on his back and hits stupid, ill-advised, JR Smith caliber shots at an insane clip.\n>\n\nImho, the Warriors can't win without Dray in terms of defensive coverage. Klay Thompson's fuck you threes cost us Game 1, but it wasn't like Klay's been the main focus of the defense thus far in the series. Livingstone and Draymond have really opened us up allowing Klay to excel. He bricked a lot tonight without those guys performing well.\n\n\n>That's not to belittle Draymond's game: he's been very good defensively. Notice that once he was no longer guarding LeBron, his jumper started falling again. Hopefully thats a causality that Lue looks into, but I don't have the analytics in front of me.\n>\n\nDraymond excels in transition threes and exploiting mismatches -- Cavs had better defensive rotation and kept the tempo in their favor today. When he switched off LeBron, the tempo slowed down a bit, letting him shoot more efficient shots. Still, Lue definetly targeted Draymond today\n\n>I hate to make another OKC comparison, but I have to--the Cavs finally brought their defense. More importantly, they used that defense to create offense, letting fast breaks come out of shattered posessions on the other end. Smart, and simultaneously breaks their overrealiance on iso-sets, and Kyrie playing off the dribble against Iggy/Livingston/Klay.\n>\n\nReally the similarity comes from defensive intensity, as well as Kyrie being able to hit outside shots and midrange pullups, very similar to Russel Westbrook's performance in the series. It's just playing good tough basketball, though the Thunder really excelled at making the Warriors test their rim protector in Ibaka, and we've done well to force awkward shots from low efficiency zones\n\n>List of teams of fans that I saw trashing LeBron: Bulls (stop it), Dubs (expected), Nuggets (stop it again), Lakers (Boi). Cut the malarky, people.\nList of teams of fans that I saw trashing Steph: OKC (guys...), Bulls (stop it again), Cavs (expected), Lakers (leave), Pistons (#fuckReggie).>\n\nIdk about the Curry hate, but I've seen *insane* LeBron hate recently. Some guy was heavily upvoted when he said LeBron really isn't a top 15 player and that MJ would always be the GOAT. Another guy was at +2 when he said Steph Curry is the GOAT. A lot of really horrible comments about how they wish he'd never win another ring, especially in Cleveland, and some shockingly mean comments about Cleveland. I'd imagine the same has happened for the Warrior fans and Steph Curry, and I'm glad you pointed it out -- it's exceptionally sucky to the reddit experience and I'm glad you pointed it out\n\n>Igoudala is probably one of the most underrated fucking defenders I've ever seen. Seriously. Watch him work. He has Pippen caliber hands, he's remarkably aware of his own body in space, his timing is (terrifyingly) better than Draymond's, and he knows how to use his weight, and how to balance it to avoid fouling.\n>\n\nHe'd absolutely still be an all-star if he played on any other team or wanted more minutes. He's such an anomaly in sports history -- a top-30 player taking such a low deal to just winnnnn. \n\n\n> Tristan Thompson had a fantastic game. Still not worth 80m's though. Sorry. Had to be said.\n> \n\nIt was either pay this guy 80m or sign some other dude for much less. Thompson is better than the replacement player and has gotten us wins over replacement. While we paid a premium for those wins, it's not the worst thing in the world. Offensive Rebounds are like three point shots in so far that analytics really likes them and they don't get enough attention in game plans. If Tristan gets 5-6 extra possesions to score on and we capitalize on 4-5, we add 10-15 points to the box score, and that's the difference between a win and a loss.
You can't blame people for trashing Steph this series, he has not nearly been himself.
Hey now.. Lebron isn't 2 for 7 in the finals *yet*
Let's wait until next game to ~~overreact~~ determine that.

#DAMN HOMECOURT YOU SCARY
Both team's roleplayers feed off of the home crowd so much.  It will take a substantial effort from either team to steal a game on the road.
it will certainly suck if this series ends up being nothing but blowouts for home teams 
That's largely been the story of the playoffs so far.
It will be extremely disappointing if we don't get 1-2 games this series that come down to clutch shots in the final 2 minutes in a close game.
Agreed. I saw someone in the game thread say "this series is finally getting good" and I\'m just thinking "what\'s good about 3 games that are over by the halfway mark of the 4th quarter?"
> the halfway mark of the 4th quarter?\n\nThat's being generous for the last two.
Game 4 I think will be close.
Warriors had all the momentum going into game 3 and look what happened. I really don't expect the Cavs to shoot that well again and the warriors that poorly. 
I hope so. Too many blowouts in these playoffs.

OHHHHHHHHHHHH WHERE YA AT!? WHERE YA AT?!
This is like the third smash reference I've seen on this sub in the past week, I love it.
Jon Tron is always involved. lol
*He\'s a very physical player*
My favourite part of the game was Mozgov checking in during garbage time, with Cavs up 13 and two minutes left. In the first quarter.
And he played great defense too, even if he shuffles his feet like me at my high school prom.\n\nPoorly.
Well, the game was over by then. But seriously it was such a good rotational move by Lue to put Frye and Mozgov out there at that time. I think Speights and Ezeli had just checked in and the Cavs went even bigger and it paid off. 
In all honesty Mozgov's size to neutralize Festus athleticism was one of the best subs I've seen Ty Lue pull. Kerr would've smiled at that one. 
Mozgov has always been valuable against GSW because of his height.
For you.

He shot very inefficiently though with his monster numbers. But it is kinda who gets the award if you beat LeBron in the Finals. Kawhi got it in 2014 and LeBron still put up 28/8/4 on 57% shooting. Then of course Iggy got it in 2015. Curious if things keep up with the way Curry is playing if GSW wins the series if it'll be someone like Draymond. 
all those games for bron were when he was in the cavs. never did it on the heat. that's interesting. 
He had better teams with the Heat
fantastic game from Bron
Rashard.. I didn't expect to hurt tonight..
Lebron played like Lebron tonight. 
especially after curry pulled that CP3 shit, it really pissed off Bron.
Cp3 shit? Elaborate?
CP3 has a number of legal "maneuvers" or moves that get under my skin. One of them is the "get in your defenders way with the ball and make him run me over for a foul while in transition." Curry did the opposite of that, the "make excessive contact off ball while going down the court and ultimately flop and draw a foul."
it was sometime in the beginning of the third I want to say? Right before LeBron made about 4 jumpers in a row. 
he kinda locked up arms with lebron and pulled lebron into himself then fell over. was a bitch ass move
And announcers didn't even talk about it..
They were tangled up. It was always gonna be called. Then why not call a foul on Curry Mark Jackson you dumbfuck
It was a pretty dumb move from Curry, near the end of the clip it looked like his shoulder could have been twisted. 
Curry doing that shit is some of the most frustrating shit ever, too. haha
**30** **POINT**  **WIN** **!** I sincerely hope Lue does what is necessary and starts RJ on Friday. The difference in the first two games and tonight is nuts. This is the NBA Finals and we don\xe2\x80\x99t have time to worry about how Kevin Love will feel if Lue brings him off the bench. He can still contribute, but I say start RJ and try to stagger Love & Kyrie so we don\xe2\x80\x99t have those stretches where our defense looks like total dog shit. 
You should play like reverse OKC. Always have one of your two superstars not named LeBron on the bench.
###KEVIN LOVE IS A TRUE AMERICAN HERO.\n\nThank you for the self-sacrifice!!! Ladies and Gentlemen, we have a series.
Still undefeated in Cleveland for post-season games
* The most impressive stat to me was halfway through the 3rd Quarter Golden State hadn't cracked 50 points. \n\n* Cavs forced a good amount of GSW's 18 turnovers\n\n* GSW FT% was ass\n\n* GSW 3Pt% was ass\n\n* T-Thomps with the OReb like whoah\n\n* I think everyone likes when LeBron plays well. When he puts up 18-10-8 I hate it. I'd rather the star score a shit ton. Maybe that's bad basketball, but it's why I watch the NBA. 
The Cavs were the antithesis of every bad /r/nba stat tonight

#Will the Warriors bounce back? Will Kevin Love with a NBA finals game? Who will steal the first Taco Bell Road game this series? Find out next time on Dragon Ball Z
This series is going to go to 7 games, but they're all going to be blowout wins for the home team making it the most boring 7 game Finals series ever. 
Seriously so many blowouts you check out early. This is the finals and I am checking out early because of how bad these blowouts have been. Crazy stuff. What is with homecourt advantage this year?
#SmallBall
I think every team has quit so far if they're down 20 towards the middle of the third
So besides the circlejerk going the other way now, Lebron had 2 awful games for his standard and people shit all over him the last two days. So are we allowed to talk about Curry having three bad games without being downvoted into oblivion?
The reason people have been saying this stuff is because there are a lot of people that would try to argue that Steph has overtaken Lebron for the title of best player in the league, yet people aren't putting him under nearly as much scrutiny. If Lebron played like Steph has these first few games or at other times during the playoffs, he'd be getting absolutely crucified. \n\nI sat through a decade of people constantly moving the goalposts to talk shit about Lebron. I accepted it before as something that comes with being the best, but now it seems like Curry is getting the best of both worlds.
Not really. Some of the criticisms had some truth to them, but in general people have been way too hard on them based on 90% jealousy. I was definitely guilty of it in Kobe's prime. But once Kobe turned into a significantly less scary old man he got nothing but respect from everyone. I imagine the same thing will happen to Lebron as he declines.\n\nI'm not saying Steph deserves to be criticized so heavily per se. I'm just kind of annoyed the media is being so inconsistent.
He simply isn't held to the same standard.  There was a time when LeBron would have been chastised if his team won a finals and he didn't get MVP.
Lebron is the better player. You usually criticize the better player. 
Here's the thing. LeBron is soooooo valuable, and you see guys like KD and Steph Curry and Rose win the MVP award, but tbh, he's the *best* in the game
I agree he is the better player, but besides that were not allowed to criticize the first unanimous MVP?
so? this is irrelevant he missed his shots he was supposed to make?
that it does, also curry is talking during the interview now and said it was all on him and i give him mad respect for owning up to it
A unanimous mvp should never be considered a decoy in my honest opinion. Step up or you deserve to be questioned
Okay the regular season unanimous mvp shouldn't be a decoy. Doesn't matter if he isn't finals mvp imo he is not playing well to the standard of a mvp in general.
Was missing 70% of his shots part of the plan too!?
Can i just make the point that if Lebron James had a first half like Curry did, he would be crucified
Not if he was injured or something. Yeah, he must have been injured. 
Every time Curry plays poorly it is assumed he is injured. If Lebron does and is slightly injured people say Jordan would have fought through it and had an even better game.
That's because Curry is light-skinned.
I'm so drunk. Go Cavs! Is someone eating a shirt tonight?
yeah. guy who wanted Frye to score 15+
I think at this point, the dude just really loves to eat shirts.
Happy the Cavs won, wasn't looking forward to a drought of Richard Jefferson Snapchat stories.
It was very refreshing not seeing Kevin Love bumbling around the court with zero intensity or heart. Richard Jefferson should get the start over him in game 4. Jefferson has been playing surprisingly solid.\n\nAlso, good to see Kyrie Irving remembered how to play big boy basketball again. Good response from him.
I'll be legitimately mad at Lue if he starts Kevin Love again during this series. 
K. Love comes off the bench going 7/8 from 3pt land in the 2nd quarter. \n\ni'm dreaming this tonight.
I like that. K Love runs the 2nd unit or something, or it's either K Love or Kyrie on with LeBron. Lue has effective sets for Love and if he's on, let him on, but don't play him above guys who can defend and play with intensity
[Don't think we forgot.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/4n5zof/kevin_love_has_been_informed_that_he_will_not_be/d412zrz)

Hopefully he comes off the bench and Jefferson starts again
Never seen an MVP being as protected as he is. He struggles, something must be wrong. Today they were talking about the refs letting the physical play go so that hindered Curry. I'm like what the hell is all this BS. \n\nLebron has games like what Curry had and it's like murder by the media. 
It's true, their media narratives couldn't be more different.\n\nCurry: small college, undersized, injury plagued, wasn't sure if he could be anything more than a spot-up shooter in the NBA. Any accomplishments he gets just add to the feel-good story. He's *really good* and that's what people have come to expect, but that's about it. He's the star on the best team in NBA history that's shown they can win when he underperforms.\n\nLebron: touted out of high school as the next Kobe or even Jordan. Athletically out of this world, guaranteed #1 pick, poised to be the face of the league for years to come. Greatness was always something that people expected of him, and people's expectations due to his image is that *he's supposed to be legendary*. If he underperforms, especially in Cleveland, no one is really gonna pick up his slack. Thus, expectations are and have been crazy high since Lebron left to Miami to start competing for championships.
I hate to bring it up, but the Dubs are not the best team in history.
Honestly I think it's because the expectations are always too high with LBJ. If Curry never wins a title again no one will give a shit in 5 years.\n\n
It's cause he's so gosh-darn cute. 
And just so *relatable*.  Real underdog story
Seriously, who wouldn't love to have him bent over an ottoman while a gentle rain can be heard through the open windows?
ie not *black* black

Kevin ONE HUNDRED AND TEN MILLION Love\n\n0 PTS (0/0FG)\n\n0 REB - 0 OFFENSIVE REBOUNDS
this entire play offs he literally has more offensive rebounds than defensive rebounds.  this dude is something else.  he makes them pay when green cheats over to help contest a shot in the paint.
Golden State can\xe2\x80\x99t win Game 3s, Cleveland\xe2\x80\x99s first bench points was a Shumpert 3 in the fourth quarter, and they win by 30. Half-Life 3 confirmed. 
I expected the Warriors to lose this game but not like this. Cavs looked like the Warriors did in game 2.
It's been a while since LeBron has dad-dicked a game like that, fun to watch.
When an older, more experienced player shows up a younger inexperienced player with his greater skill.\n\nLike playing a game against your dad when you were 12, most of the times he'd obliterate you to teach you a lesson. \n\nThat is what Lebron did tonight.
Oh okay. I'd never heard that phrase before and it sounded weird haha\n\nAlso, thank God I've never been worse than my dad at basketball\n\nLiterally\n\nThe entirety of my life \n\nNever was worse\n\nI came out of the womb and crossed him over

WHY IS EVERYTHING 1. IM SO CONFUSED
I love Lebron's effort and intensity
This just in: Kevin Love slipped while taking a shower and hit his head on the floor. NBA to evaluate concussion and will be out on G4.
The K Love jokes are fucking old and he's obviously a net positive to the Cavs...\n\nReading this thread, I'm convinced that none of you are original.\n\nThe reason they won is cause a) it's a home game...finally and b) LeBron was excellent. The best in the world. Curry can make everything, including shots out of his ass (yes I know he makes shit like that), and even so he's still not as good as LeBron when he plays like this.
[For the land](http://i.imgur.com/RBzck7H.png)
Am I seeing this right? The cavs bench only had 15/120 points...
Cavs bench scored only in 4th
I am so proud of this team. After all the shit every single player got from the media/fans in the last week, that was a hell of a bounce back. Kyrie had so much swagger out there, it looked like once he got it going early, he knew he was back. JR was money tonight, that's the JR I remember. Clutch from downtown and showed so much heart on defense. LeBron struggled with turnovers again, luckily he was a beast in every other aspect. Amazing leadership. RJ was such an amazing pickup for this team. He plays with so much grit and passion, and is still extremely talented for his age. Shout out to all the people on this sub that talked about how trash TT is after Game 2. 14 pts 13 rebs, what a performance. 5 yrs/82 mil doesn't look bad at all when he plays like that. \n\nOur offense looked so much more crisp tonight, people just played with so much more energy and confidence. \n\nOur defense was amazing tonight. Curry and Thompson were completely swarmed. The close outs on everyone else seemed much less lethargic. People were fighting for every loose ball, through every screen, just playing with so much more heart.
Thanks

I really hope the Cavs play a good game, I want to see some good basketball tonight. I don\'t want it to be too easy for the Warriors.\n\n...\n\n"Ok, not that good, damn."\n
This shit starts when an away team wins. 
I like how the narrative is now the dubs suck.\n\nThis sub is such a joke

Cavs in 4
Honestly even without all the comments, this has around the same level of analysis as the normal postgame threads
Thompson just called Mozgov dirty. smh.
Damn is Reddit still broken 
FUCK. I JUST WANT A FREE TACO!
The warriors got punched in the fucking mouth and could'nt fully recover. Never gave up though. I expect them to come out hard from tip off Friday.
someone on the cavs needs to "accidentally" extend kevin love\'s concussion protocol, like bump into him or something.

The Cavs played a great game but is no one going to talk about that Cleveland crowd?\n\nThe place was going to blow the roof off in the first quarter. You could tell the entire team fed off of the crowd's energy.
FUCK DRAYMOND GREEN

Whelp time for /r/nba to change its narrative and say Irving is a beast PG and Lebron is GOAT while the Warriors are overrated or something.\n\n\n\n
Even if the Warriors win, I don't know if you can call this team better than the 96 Bulls. The Bulls lost 3 games in the entire playoffs, with score differences of 3, 21, 11. The Warriors have had a few really terrible games this postseason. 
Holy shit. My mom came into my room to bring me a plate of chicken nuggets and I literally screamed at her and hit the plate of chicken nuggets out of her hand. She started yelling and swearing at me and I slammed the door on her. I'm so distressed right now I don't know what to do. I didn't mean to do that to my mom but I'm literally in shock from the results tonight. I feel like I'm going to explode. Why the fucking fuck are they losing? This can't be happening. I'm having a fucking breakdown. I don't want to believe the world is so corrupt. I want a future to believe in. I want the Dubs to go back to back. I cannot fucking deal with this right now. It wasn't supposed to be like this, I thought they were supposed to sweep??? This is so fucked.
It's a copy paste about Bernie Sanders losing
What just happened lol 
oh, that makes sense. Thanks r/nba!
Brewer and KJ are trash. If you want to trade Love for athletic wings go after talented ones. Maybe Middleton/Ariza or literally any other wings besides two of the Rockets worst bench players, on one of the worst benches in the NBA this year. 
The 2016 NBA Finals are still the only finals in history to have every game decided by double digits.
Won by 11
It's actually kind of boring too.\n\nAll the series drama has been outside the games and mostly on twitter.
It's exciting for the casual fans though.\n\nOMG Dray called LeBron a bitch? Klay said LeBrons feelings got hurt?\n\n> Tune in this Sunday SUNDAY SUNDAY FOR THE BIGGEST SHOWDOWN IN NBA HISTORY\n\nShit is like the Real housewives or some shit. 
Did you see this sub this week? So ridiculous lol
Honestly, I didn't think tonight's game was boring at all. I felt like the Warriors were perpetually on the cusp, about to strike, about to even it out and maybe even swoop the lead right back. I was tense. Without Kyrie and Lebron's heroics, the Warriors win this one. It was exciting. 
This really felt like a close game even though we were perpetually down 7-9 points. Props to James and Kyrie. They played incredibly
That's because you guys have so many 3 point threats that you can turn a 9 point lead into a 1 possession game in less than a minute. It's terrifying.
This really was the closest game through 3.5 quarters too.
2.5 really. Bogut went out and the Cavs feasted at the rim.
Eh not as much as I thought they would.  Kyrie and LeBron's jumpers were just not missing anything.
Notice that the Warriors weren't really bodying/running guys from outside. Their best choice for most of that second half was to take a chance with jumpers when they have no defensive presence in the paint.\n\nLebron definitely had a crazy shooting night but strong defensive centers are the rock upon which Warriors defense is built upon. 
Wasn't G4 like 6. With half a quarter to play? I honestly was too rattled/drunk to remember when I knew it was over

I have a feeling we are going to be seeing this photo a lot on this sub in the future.\n\nOn a serious note, this picture actually reminds me that Kevin Love played as hard on defense tonight as I've ever seen him play. His offensive game was non-existent, but for someone without much defensive talent, he gave a great effort. Particularly when he had to play PnR defense against Curry.
Show me your war face!
This is the greatest picture I've ever seen.\n\nIt's safe to say I *love* it.

Valiant performance from Anderson Varejao considering he lost the same ear twice in the span of five minutes.
as a super casual fan, he is everything I hate about watching the nba
He's a straight clown. It would be justice if the league reviews some of the plays and slaps him with a fine. 
He should have gotten an Oscar for that, he made it look like JR stabbed his ear
Terrible calls by the refs on a known flopper. Nobody likes to see that. But he played fairly smart all told, considering it kept working out. That one rebound in the 4th that he snagged from Tristan and threw off his leg and out of bounds was almost a momentum changer. Only down by 6 at that point, but kyrie and lebron....damn
I hate seeing players flop more than anything else. It'll turn into soccer if we keep rewarding it. I love things like the nhl that call a penalty on a flop/dive
Maybe even call it a foul and play it on the tv and award a technical if you're caught. I think public shaming would do it
Man, stop hating on the dude. He has a condition where his ear's pain receptors are located on his shoulder. Trust me, am neuroscientist.
I can confirm. I'm not neuroscientist but I did stay at a Holiday Inn Express. 
You forgetting when the 7 footer got knocked down by mighty delavadova bumping into him. 
He threw himself over Delly and grabbed his jersey, pulled Delly in and flopped. 
So annoying to watch his stupid acting. 
If I was an official i would literally let him die on the court before he got a foul out of me.
Seriously, it was out of control.
We watched him do the same thing for like 9 years \n\n\n\n\n^and ^we ^fucking ^loved ^it
Oscar worthy performance
>Daytime Emmy-worthy performance\n\nFTFY
Denzel!!
I think Varejao spent half of his minutes flailing like a fish out of water. The man is a professional flopper, never have I seen a 7 foot tall GIANT of a man spend so much time pretending to be knocked over by people he has at least 100 or so pounds on
This is my first time seeing it as an opponent. How awful
If he's gonna make a career out of flopping, guy gotta learn to shoot frees
He's already made a career out of flopping haha we've been watching him do it for years and it was great \n\n^^until ^^he ^^was ^^against ^^us
I think Andy has a bright future in WWE, he can make anyone look strong
Anderson "The Caribbean Cool" Varejao
He's not a bad basketball player. He's not a good basketball player. He's THE basketball player.
VARE\n\nJOA\n\nTHE GUY WITH THE CURLIEST HAIR
All he needs is an apple and a Hawaiian shirt as his prop

Kevin Love vs. Harrison Barnes in a game of HORSE would take like six weeks to finish
Thats Harrison "Max Contract" Barnes for you.
I swear i get panic attacks when Barnes gets the ball. The only player of the Warriors that I can't trust.
Lmao you trust Verajo over Barnes?
It's hard not to trust an actor more skilled than Tom Hanks
I mean the yam was 0/6 tonight 
You can trust him to suck.  \n

lmao. barnes was pissing me off all night
He had to have missed like five wide open threes. 
Nail in the coffin was the open 3 off an inbounds down 7.  Instead clank!\n\nI guess the silver lining is the Cavs still gave up tons of open looks....
those two back to back missed wide open threes... ugh 
What about Curry, also the fact that he tries way too hard to be fancy with the ball for random unforced turnovers is dumb. \n\nGSW has been setting records in the regular season, post season, and there is a good chance that the back to back two time regular season MVP will not be the the finals MVP.
Who gives a fuck. Warriors wining one more game is all any dubs fans should care about. People care way too much about these individual accomplishments, FMVP should not be that big a deal. hanging banners is the only thing that matters at the end of the day, and we're in good shape to get another. 
Welcome back to the realm of humanity, where occasionally 3's don't go in.  ;)\n\n^^^I'm ^^^scared ^^^help ^^^me
haha true. I guess we felt what playing against Curry can feel like at times, Irving & James were unbelievable. Probably the best performance I've ever seen in person. 
How many minutes before the game ended did you leave 
To whoever pays Harrison Barnes 20m next year...good luck with that.
To whomever pays Kevin Love $110 million...good luck with that.
CLE needs to trade that nerd
Boston would be glad to have him!\n\nBut I doubt they'll let him go. They traded Wiggins for him, getting rid of him now would leave a lot of egg on their faces--it'd be especially awkward for GM/President/Coach/Co-Owner LeBron.\n\nBest option for them would be to try and flip him for Blake Griffin (imo). Both teams seem a bit disgruntled with their all-stars. But that's just from the outside looking in. Maybe it's not as bad as it's made out to be?
Why would the Clips do this? \n
Cleveland would do that in a second. No idea why Clippers would do that. 
Blake and Lebron on the same team would be fun as hell to watch.
After he broke his hand a lot of stuff came out about how the team doesn't like him. And last year a really big deal was made about Chris Paul hating Blake. \n\nMichael Wilbon, Stephen A. Smith, and Bill Simmons have talked about the animosity on the team. And when he was out for that long stretch the Clippers played their best basketball of the season.\n\nThe main reason they'd make the trade would be if the animosity in the locker room is as strong as it's being made out to be (and not being overblown by the media as these things often are). Blake would flourish under Chris Paul and Doc. A pass first PG that'd feed him whenever he looked even half open would make him a huge part of the offense which he's been complaining about since he went to CLE. So I think Love would be very open to the trade as well.
Wiggins would fit in perfect
Probably because LeBron knows he doesn't have time to help develop a potential running mate. He knows he has a narrowing window to cement his legacy so he bet on Love since he was already established as a top 20 player (arguably top 10 in Minnesota). 5 years from now Wiggins might be the next face of the NBA but LeBron doesn't have the luxury of waiting to find out.
That sounds like the reason they traded him
*hindsight*
Lol I feel like you called him a nerd just because he's white
We tried.  We really did.  Love looked great at Minnesota.  
Plus no one anticipated this Warriors team becoming this good, and the whole small ball thing that's taken the league by storm is a death knell for slower bigs. 
He was solid for almost the entire Eastern conference run, he just matches up terribly against GS and it seems to have gotten in his head. 
I can at least respect Kevin love for not taking 14 shots
The 14 shots were not bad shots at all, he just missed them. He had 4+ open shots that he bricked.
He did a good job of "staying out of the way" tonight. Only set picks, help post, and made a few decent defensive plays. He\'s playing like someone who knows he\'s been playing terribly and has decided to help out in any way he can, which is pretty much the most you can hope someone in his position would do.
Yea, you have to consider he just had a concussion. My gf had a concussion the same day Klove did playing pickup and she's still woozy and nauseous. I can imagine Klove has a pounding headache and feels like puking running and jumping. He really shouldn't be playing any contact sports for a few weeks.  \n\nNot sure why the commentators were trashing him during the game. Brain injuries are no fucking joke.
Lol it's cute that you think that. 
It's admirable as shit if you ask me. Putting your ego aside for the good of the team is hard as shit. 
He did just have a concussion, I think people treat concussions way too lightly... They do effect you for quite some time... 
Imagine if you are one of the best in the world at what you do, but you're going against the only people in the world that negate your biggest strengths and highlight your biggest weaknesses. On top of that you get a concussion after you played a very solid game 1. It'd still be hard to take a back seat and not bitch. He's manned up though and accepted his job and does his best that he can. 
100%. All finals tbh. He's taken a back seat and not distracted at all. People keep ripping on his defense but he's been solid for the most part. It's his offense that's so reprehensible and he's stayed involved. Much respect.
Did you see Frye? 
Especially when Lebron rips your chest open and eats your heart when you go for a high five.
Damn do people really believe that was a high five attempt?
I mean, if you don't have any context...
can someone explain what the context of that was?
Kevin Love was talking about defense and just making a weird face
I'm almost certain he was talking about a rebound and not going for a high five there. 
I'd like to think so too. Poor Kev.

Fucking Varejo hit in the ear, looks like he was shot on the floor.\n
His ear was hardly touched on the play- give that guy an oscar.. pathetic. They need to start giving out reverse fouls for guys like that who try and fake it and delay the game.
Now i really realize how annoying he is to play against, when im not watching him through wine and gold colored glasses
He first went to hold his face, then realize he was actually tapped on the ear and had to move his hands. What a twat.
Thank god he sucks at free throws; or any throws at all excluding throwing himself on the floor.

That's not even sad thats just fucking hilarious. 
If you look closely you can actually pinpoint the exact moment his heart breaks in two.
damn you were 13seconds after /u/Strokemm \n\n
That's because I looked up that exact quote! Curse my meticulous dedication to precisely accurate meme-ing! 
If you look closely you can actually pinpoint the exact moment LastRedCoat's heart breaks in two.
kinda feel bad for the guy
man, Love looks like he's trying to go to his dad for encouragement, but his dad just greets him with disappointment. 
Kevin Love is the only player who would win the game and still deserve an MJ meme
One of the most awkward handshakes in the history of the game...K Love somehow outdid his awkward handshake with Wesley Johnson a couple years ago
Wasn't an attempted handshake. Just out of context gif. 
Yeah, it's kind of awkward how many people think this is a rejected high five.
Cavs Big Three had 84 points tonight.
Did I just actually feel bad for Lil Kev, damn. 
The stats don't show it, but Love obviously had some kind of positive impact for the Cavs tonight.
He only took 5 shots...its not like he went 1-20
Honestly I think he did a *fuck* of a job tonight on the Pick and Rolls out on the perimeter. Curry hit one right in his face, but even then, his defense was good af.
Agreed, he looked fine on d. The few times he got iso'd on the 3 pt line with curry he played about as well as possible
He did: A savvy 2 pts, a hard fought 2 boards, 1 dazzling assist, and only 2 turnovers. He also chipped in with 0 steals.
EXCUSE ME... three boards.
+18 but idk how much that says really.
its kinda laughable how bad Love has been this series, I mean wtf
He was actually +18 tonight, second only to Kyrie's +20. That's actually pretty damn good considering everyone considers him to be a defensive liability and he only posted 2 points and 3 rebounds.\n\nEdit: Yes, we all know you think that +/- is a useless stat. Go upvote one of the several people who already said that instead of posting it again.
lol situations like these are why +/- are such a bad metric...
It just means his teammates played really well.
Which, I totally get. But he had the second best +/- in the entire game. \n\nKyrie: +20\n\nLove: +18\n\nLeBron: +13\n\nTT/JR: +11\n\nRJ: +7\n\nShump: +6\n\nDellavedova/Mo/DJ/JJ/Mozgov: all negative\n\nYou expect Kyrie and LeBron to have high +/- in a game where they both drop 41 (and also to have caught the other team's best attempts at a comeback), and some bleedover to JR and TT because they share offensive minutes. But Love has triple Shump's on an extra 7 minutes of playing time, and a higher value than JR, who has been playing good defense this year.
When it doesn't agree with your narrative, it's a terrible metric.
Or it shows how important Kevin's spacing and passing is to Cleveland? There's a reason Lue is still playing him
He set screens and got it to the hot hand.  Definitely made some plays on defense as well.
He played hard today. Only reason he really didn't get any looks were because of the way Kyrie and LeBron were flowing 
Good grief. 82 points by LBJ/Kyrie.\n\nLove 2 points.\n\nWhat you can take away from this series and this game: Love and Barnes are not maximum contracts guys.\n\nLeBron/Kyrie - Curry/Klay most certainly are.
There have been games where you can argue Barnes has been the best warrior. 
That would be a very poor argument.
he didn't say this series, or that anyone would win the argument
Love is still a contract player. This Cavs team just doesn't make sense with him. Now put him on the clerics or rockets...
I think he'd more of a tank or damage dealer than a cleric. 
Is he going to be praying on the Clerics? 
Except Love put up an efficient 26/12/4 just two years ago. He looks like a shell of that player now, but he earned his max contract. 
Everything about Love suggested he was though. Can't really fault Cleveland giving a max to a guy who averaged 26/12 one year. Barnes has proved nothing and will be a massive disappointment though
Big three combined for 84 points, pretty good. 
Love only scored 2 more points than me that game... nerd to negotiate my contract mane
this guys looks at the glass half full :)
He doesn't really match up well against anyone on the warriors and they're so good at switching screens he doesn't get open 3 pointers. 
He's getting no touches, he's like a homeless man's Bosh right now
There's a reason he's not getting touches. He's not very good when he gets them. I feel like he's very weak the ball. I'm not sure what happened when he came to the Cavs but this isn't the same person that played for Minnesota 
That's kind of an insult for bosh though
He looks lost when he does get them. Dude has hands like butter 
Lol he ain't even hospital Bosh right now.
You mean current Bosh?
Bosh IS hospital Bosh right now
Oh my god this makes me want to cry
If you watch it again he's not even going for a high five. He's gesturing about the defense on the play before 
I guess. I don't know what Lebron is doing, though. Is he boxing out? Tightening his belt? Trying to put two strong magnets together the wrong way? 
Warriors just had like 3 offensive rebounds because no one s boxing out.
Wasn't able to catch the game, what's the context of this? Love looks so defeated 
LeBron and Kyrie sapped his life forces. You can see it in the gif.
Copying and pasting myself from the game thread... \n\nI vividly remember seeing this. It followed a play where Kevin went for a block, blocked it, and then whoever his helper was didn\'t get the rebound, leading to a easy layup for GSW. \n\n\nKevin was pleading his case to Lebron. I remember thinking to myself "Kevin has a point"\n\nThe gif begins late. You can see Kevin mouthing "I blocked the shot" but this gif begins after that had happened. \n\nOut of context, yes, it\'s comical. 
The fact that Love has to defend himself after that shows how hard it has to be playing with Lebron. Doesn't look fun at all. 
Said this better than I did. I was waiting for someone to point out that he wasn't actually having a high five rejected. But yeah, it sure does look funny. 
Kevin Love's time in Cleveland summed up in one gif.
It's like an Episode of Twilight Zone where he finally got his wish to be in a better place but didn't realize all the evil consequences.  Poor fella
I'm a Warriors fan but that still broke my heart. Poor Love :(
Yeah I actually feel bad seeing that.
Hey now, the Cavs big three combined for 84 points. They all contributed. 
Holy shit I feel bad for Kevin
the man still got feelings\n\nion think its that deep tho he just looks so sad in the vid
Yeah to be honest I thought he got hurt in the game because I didn't notice him do anything for almost a whole quarter.
Mfw my parents weren't satisfied by me just trying my best
Why you no champion?\nTalk to me when you champion!!!
when you finally get the bartenders attention and he tells you its cash only
Damn. Now he has to go to the ATM and get charged $5 for using it and another $1.50 from the bank for using a non-branch ATM.
Where do you live that it costs $6.50 to get money out from an ATM?
I've been charged $6 for using an atm before 
Too real
right in the feels
watching this makes me actually feel sad
[Poor Kevin] (http://i.imgur.com/vyTZlWB.jpg)
You can pinpoint the frame in which his heart shatters.
I think those were still effects from his concussion realizing he didn't deserve a high five from the king 
maybe lebron should've choo-choo-chose wiggins
I said it from the jump but Cavs would have been much better off with Wiggins on a rookie deal and using the money they gave Love to fill out their roster with better role players... but ayyy thanks for my boy Wiggy doe\n\nedit: wiggins averaged 25 ppg vs the Warriors this season.. perfect guy to match their length and is a way better defender than people think he is.. he could easily start next to James at SG and then you bring JR Smith off the bench.. way better for the Cavs than having to deal with Love who is non existent 
Wiggins isn't a good shooter or defender... plus the offense that he does provide might not have been as good, it seems like when he has the opportunity he sort of floats along
He was learning on a bad team. It's an assumption, but you would think he would develop differently on a winning team
Right, develop differently as in develop worse. Championship contenders can rarely afford to have a rookie play crucial minutes, they just make dumb mistakes from lack of experience.
Kawhi says hi 
Who needs three point shooting
nah. I don't know if the trades would have still gone through but he would be redundant with Smith and Shump. I agree that the Love trade, in the context of the Warriors, is poor, though.
Wiggins gets most of his points from isolations and the Cavs already have Kyrie and Lebron. The warriros would just dare Wiggins to shoot and sag off and help on Kyrie and Lebron. Jr smith is much better suited to play with them 
I said it when we drafted Wiggins... I always thought Lebron would be back after the Miami contract, and when we got him the media immediately started hyping Wiggins for Love. Love is a fantastic offensive PF, but he isn't strong/big enough to play against the dominant (Drummond/Howard) centers and he's not a good enough defender, especially on P&R to be a 3 and D PF which is what Lebron really wants.\n\nLove is a PF you build around as the core of the offense. He can get you 40/10-15 and a couple assists but he needs a lot of time with the ball to do that. Wiggins was already a good defender, extraordinarily athletic, and could easily have started that the 2 with Lebron at the 3 (though Wiggins 3 Lebron 4 would be my preference).\n\nWhen we traded for Love we gave up a future all-star to load our offense with more options than we can use while sacrificing defense and all of our cap room. Lebron's a great passer, he could use Wiggins slashing w/ defense, and Wiggins will likely develop a decent jump shot to compliment the two.\n\nT'Wolves are going to be stacked in a couple years.
you guys are gonna be so fuckin stacked I'm already afraid. 
I think you are massively underestimating them. If the whole team lives up to it's potential they'll be scary-good. 
Lebron is like, enjoy this shit now GSW, you're gonna have to go thru a Thibs team with atheletes next year, RIP endurance.
Who are they, the Rams?
So Damn SP00KY
Wiggins is super redundant on this Cavs team, and he can\'t shoot 3s. His best skillset at the moment is transition offense and mid range jump shooting, and the Cavs already have two players who are super good at those things(Bron and Kyrie, respectively). And even the assumption that "Love was trash" in this game is overstated, he was +18, played super hard on defense, spaced and played smartly on offense. Even if he\'s missing jumpers, you have to respect his shooting and passing if youre the Warriors, just being on the court is a positive influence for the Cavs O.

I haven't seen a Kevin disappear this hard since Home Alone
Can you describe what it means to "disappear hard"
No. I just wanted to set up a Home Alone joke.
We Need to Talk About Kevin 
That Kevin could shoot.
Can someone tell me what in the world Kevin Love brings to the table in these finals and why he's out there at all with the numbers he's putting up? Serious question. I'm not a bball genius, but from what I see he's not defending well and do we even need to talk about his offense? 
It's weird, Love had 2 points tonight but went +18. Go figure!
Well he played a lot of minutes with LeBron and Kyrie
You could also say that LeBron and Kyrie are +13 and +20 respectively in part because they played a lot of minutes with Kevin.
He never was nor will he ever be a good defender.  He's not quick enough or long enough or athletic enough to be a good defender.  \n\nHowever, offensively he's completely miscast in Cleveland.  They've pigeon holed him to corner three's and spot mopping duties offensively. His best space is the space in which Kyrie and LBJ both operate from (top of key - elbows). CLE doesn't have a defensive stopper at center, and the 4 is LBJ's best position on the court, both of which expose Loves inefficiencies.  There isn't anywhere to hide him on D against GSW either, which compounds the issue. \n\nKLove is still a great player. He's just not a top tier player, and is miscast in CLE I think his best fit is 1st off the bench type of player to play with the second unit to best maximize his offensive skills, and minimize his defensive liabilities.   
I don't like the terminology because it's a passive aggressive way of insinuating that a player is a bitch ..as if somehow aggression and physicality outright trumps finesse and basketball IQ. I find that subtext absurd.
I was watching the second half last night and EVERY single time down the floor he just ran to the corner and stayed there.  Sometimes he rotated the other corner.  If that is all the coach tells you to do you aren't going to look like anything great.
The NBA has also changed a lot in the last couple years in regards to defense and match-ups (at least in the upper tier of teams) compared to when he was putting up monster numbers in Minnesota
41/16/7 with 3 steals and blocks and ONLY two turnovers aka the Fuck you I'm Lebron statline
The "I have three kids" statline
Stephen A gonna take credit for calling him out, acting like Lebron has time to watch First Take during the finals.
LEBRON JAMES MVP
No argument here. It's almost like last year's series all over again.
And one of the turnovers wasn't even his fault. It was a terrible inbound pass that caused a half court violation.
Grown ass man right there
That man has three kids!
And a man
Villain LeBron is the strongest LeBron.
Indeed.  I love how much The crowd was booing him and they eventually stopped when he started tearing apart dubs. 
This is the darkest timeline.
I keep hoping for that glare that we saw in G6 in Boston.  No glare, but pretty close tonight.  And Klay was playing Rondo's role of *ima take this bitch away from you or die trying, LeBron*.
That was the best game I've ever seen him play, he just had that cold blank glare on his face the entire game. Had 45 and 15 from memory while sitting most of the 4thQ because it was a blowout, what a clutch performance.

It's crazy how well they defended Kyrie, too. Lebron did a great job taking all the jump shots the Warriors gave him. 
Fuck I forgot about that. That game was so legit.
fuck i miss that game
What do you mean? The big three had 84 points combined 
Yeah and Kobe combined with the white Mamba for 81 
Ah yes, the Dynamic Duo

Props to Kyrie.\n\nBut how the hell do you still look sleepy when you have those two women draped all over you?
he's high
Kyrie about to fuck every bitch in Oakland as extra fuck you.
is there a non-racist way for me to say kyrie always reminds me of [gunter from futurama](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/c7/30/f4/c730f4634d4052077987b53066351889.jpg)?
Asking if there's a non racist way to say it didn't help. But I sort of agree with you.
It's the droopy eye.
Of course Kyrie gets girls. I'm willing to admit he's a good looking dude.
Well spoken, funny, and can even dance and sing... kinda unfair really
He looks like Ray Allen in that scene from He Got Game

Uhh she most likely is a whore.
Nah. Come on man. She's hanging off one of the best basketball players in the world because he's such a good guy, great personality, really caring, funny - just a true family man. \n\nHas nothing to do with fame and millions of dollars. Totally unrelated. 
And kyrie is just hanging out with her for he personality right ? Why is one called a whore and the other a player ?
Damn, where do I pick one of them up? CVS?

#FUCK DRAYMOND GREEN
FUCK DRAYMOND GREEN
There it is!
Are we back to "Fuck Draymond" or do we gotta wait for him to play again?
Wait, was i supposed to stop?
FUCK DRAYMOND.. for life. 
No need to wait.  We all know that Draymond was kicking people in the balls in his suite across the street.
I'm here for the Harrison Barnes overreactions. How much money did he lose tonight?
No way anyone throws any money at him after that. Shit, I don't think he can even get a job at McDonald's now.
Honestly, I don't see how GS recovers from that. They were broken on that game. Cleveland in six. 
Well it starts by getting dray back....
 If Cleveland closes the series out in game 6 I'll get a Lebron tattoo on my face and stick a basketball up my ass. 
>Honestly, I don't see how GS recovers from that. They were broken on that game. Cleveland in six. \n\nFucking simple: 15 players, 15 pairs of Curry 2s. Nobody can stop that much fire
Oh god no! Not the Curry 2s! There will be children watching the telecast!
Should we tell him?
He knows. Anything is possible. Litrally.
nahhhh let him have fun
I might be wrong but I think that was sarcasm for how reactionary this sub is
cavs sweep in 7
Even Draymond Green was more productive than Kevin Love on the court today. 
Love was +23 despite having 2 points. Goes to show how moronic some fans are after only seeing the point category on the stat sheet.
or how worthless that stat is
Outside of his effort on PnR defense he was useless. +23 is a product of him getting out of the way and letting kyrie and lebron work.
Yeah, but a lot of people can do that.  The one downside to the +/- stat is that in general...that's a team effort.  Someone like Love can disappear and still excel in this field because on the court is Lebron and Kyrie.  I think it's more telling if like everyone is + and then one guy is -  and you know he was a general downside when he was on the court.  That said, at least Love did his best to be productive in every other aspect of the game.
Reports coming in say he downed a coke and was feeling "aight" by the end of the third quarter.
Nah just Henny and chicken tenders.\n\nSource: I work at the coliseum. 
Hennies and tendies
LeBron just saved Green $500
[Poor Kevin](http://i.imgur.com/8tStgoL.gifv)
Can someone explain to me what happened here lol
Love got called for a foul I think and was saying his hands were straight up. LeBron is telling him (I think about the last play where Love missed a  rebound) to use his body to gain position.
oh my god
Holy crap, that actually made me frown
Yeah I feel bad for him. Not his fault he doesn't work with this team 
Aww, I feel bad for all the hate he gets
Watching the games though, it's not entirely his fault he's doing terrible. Part of it is mental, but I think he doesn't get a chance to get into a rhythm at all. If he gets more touches I'm sure he'd be playing better.
He's just trying to drop some dimes
I don't think people understand what happened. The video makes it look like Kevin was coming for a high five. I'm pretty sure he was just explaining something to LeBron. I just can't remember what it was. 
Exactly. He was showing LeBron how he was defending the play and LeBron showed him how he should've. Still a bit sad though. 
Looks like he might be doing the "I contested the shot I swear" while LeBron is like "you gotta stick that dude"
Sometimes I hate when people explain the truth.
You are correct but that doesn't get upvotes 
Pretty sure it was after a foul and he's trying to say he only had his hand up. 
No we like the high five reality better
Lebron loses: /r/nba posts their anti-lebron manifestos\n\nLebron wins: /r/nba - "o shit lol didn\'t yall learn by now this dude always shuts up the haters, dam overreacting sub lol"
It should be Fuck Draymond circle jerk.
Now you know how the last 3 days have been for anyone not a warriors fan
People on Reddit tell me it's just different people posting each time, I think it's just bipolar teenagers 
It's more like there's two factions that are both only vocal when they're right 
To be fair, these are different people saying these things \n\nTypically the losing teams fans stay away from game threads and the winning teams fans all celebrate 
Thank god this sub has started to understand this. Comments like the parent comment here are so goddamn annoying.
Please, let it be known. 
this is definitely what happens
Playoff /r/NBA is one of the most overreactionary subreddits I've ever seen
It's toxic af, it's the age demographic I'm pretty sure. \n\n/r/nfl isn't the same twitter meme culture this sub is
Because the people who lost ***stay away*** when they lose and the other side flocks to /r/nba when they win. 
/r/nfl is definitely more serious and there are less memes, but that's part of what I like about this sub, everyone just has fun. 
Yeah but the tradeoff is everybody tries to be funny, which just means way less actually quality basketball discussion 
And eventually it's just the same shitty memes over and over again.
LeBron nodded
At some point people give up even trying to be funny though. \n\nLike is saying things like "LeBitch suck my dick" or "Draymond, eat a cock you donkey" even funny to anyone?\n\nJust kind of hateful.
And it all still got upvoted. \n\nIf you're going to be hateful, at least be clever 
/r/NBA went from "Lol fuck Draymond" to "Leave Draymond alone!!1!" in a span of couple of weeks. 
The hivemind that the NBA rigged the playoffs to extend the series by suspending draymond was fucking hilarious. 
Span of one day. Pre suspension: "HOW CAN DRAYMOND KEEP GETTING AWAY WITH THESE DIRTY PLAYS"\n\nPost suspension "FUCK LEBRON HOW DARE HE SAY DRAYMOND SHOULD BE SUSPENDED"
More so than /r/NFL, and that's really saying something
Gotta give credit where credit is due, one thing r/NFL does well is keep /new clean. Meanwhile we have pictures of road signs on the highway calling Lebron a bitch or TFW posts...
It helps that you only play one game per series.
/r/NFL can be really boring but it's way more level headed or at least less reactionary than /r/NBA\n\nEdit: /r/baseball is GOAT subreddit though
Yeah but then you gotta watch baseball.
Good thing I enjoy baseball
Jokes on you, baseball is amazing, and the tribe is playing some great ball right now. 
What in the fuck
Shout out to r/hockey as well.

DAE YORDANO VENTURA IS HITLER?
/r/baseball is just as reactionary as any other sports subreddit. That place was a shit show all last World Series.
Yeah, every sports sub is crazy reactionary. I personally just think this subreddit takes it to a new level lol
Way more reactionary.  Makes me cringe either way the jerking goes.
/r/NBA: "Wade is the worst human ever, I hate him, what a loser! Fuck the Heat!"\n\n/r/NBA: "Draymond is the worst human ever, I hate him, what a loser! Fuck the Warriors!"\n\n/r/NBA: "LeBron  is the worst human ever, I hate him, what a loser! Fuck the Cavs!"
I have a feeling that a lot of these people tend to overlap. 
You're forgetting literally Hitler.
Fr. I remember people calling him a ball hog in the Warriors series this year when he was literally the only dude hitting shots consistently. He would be getting double and triple teamed and would pass it out only for Ariza/Brewer/Beverley/Dmo/JET and they would just clank it. Hell, him shooting OVER those double and triple teams would probably be a better shot than anything else. Shit man, I just wanna see a proper offense next year, which MDA will hopefully do for us
Guys. I figured it out. The first game we won, I was broke down on the side of the highway coming back from my sisters baby gender reveal party, learned I was going to be uncle to a niece, and was on a game blackout the entire time.\n\nToday, I forced myself on a blackout of the game.\n\nI will take one for the city of Cleveland.\n\nI will not watch the next two games.
not all heroes wear capes
You better follow through just in case.
> the next two games.\n\nSubtle yet bold.\n
There's parties for gender reveals now? 
i guess it's to make sure nobody brings gifts?\n\nidk man
Yeah it's retarded. Another cash grab just for fucking raw
No money was spent except on just things from a grocery store and some point.\n\nDidn't use some planners or anything like most people. Just had a barbecue with a cake my mom made for it. \n\nEssentially we had a barbecue that crushed my sisters bf's hopes. 
I'd be outraged if I was the baby.\n\nHow dare they presume to know my gender identity.\n\n^^^^^/s

Draymond Green somehow outplayed Kevin Love tonight.
LOVE: +18
Also if Cleveland somehow win this series, I will get a Cavs tattoo. 
**KEVIN LOVE IS UNDEFEATED IN IN THE PLAYOFFS WHEN DRAYMOND GREEN IS SUSPENDED IN A GAME FIVE OF AN NBA FINALS... SCORING UNDER 2 POINTS WHILE WEARING A BLACK SLEEVED JERSEY**
big if true
BLACK SLEEVE JERSEYS ARE THE CHARM!
lowkey when I tuned in and saw the Cavs in the black unis I knew they would win. \n\nLeBron loves that villain look.
Well when you put it that way MJ just looks like a scrub in comparison.
Lebron fucking James and Kyrie fucking Irving. 82 points combined. That was game 6 2012 ECF Lebron. Incredible. \n\nMeanwhile, Kevin Love was trash again.
Duuuude amazing Lebron game but I'm not sure I've ever seen a performance as terrifying as that game 6. Gonna tell my kids about that game
Jefferson needs to start next game. Love has been getting straight up outplayed by him.
Or Kevin Love needs to eat as much food as possible between now and Thursday so he can become Fat Kevin Love again
I wonder if it's some lasting effect of the concussion. Everything just looked off for him tonight. He wasn't even grabbing rebounds...
Would not be surprised at all. Head injuries are no joke.
If he still has effects isn't that considered him still being concussed?
Passing the concussion protocol probably isn't a 100% guarantee the person has completely recovered from the concussion.  Or maybe Love is worried about getting hurt again and as a result is playing more timidly
Concussions are murder. I got one playing football, went back in the game. Every reaction was slow, missed tackles, everything looked hazy. Then I went home and realized I forgot how to type. Like I just sat there staring at my keyboard. I was in a haze for over a week after. In a precision sport like basketball, a concussion would be killer.
Dude got out rebounded by Curry mid-4th quarter..
Exactly, he's not right at all, he wasn't hustling and was sluggish. Some of it is just a slump, but concussions fuck with your focus so much. 
Concussions are a bitch for real. Don't even feel like yourself. Shit lasts a long time
You're right. Had one after I took a charge and hit my head on the floor in a game. I went out and guys wanted me to come back in. No way I could have even if I wanted. Dizziness and positional vertigo lasted weeks. 
And they have multiplying effects. After your first concussion it's then easier to get a concussion in the future, and more than one concussion, even one actually, can have lasting effects well into old age.
Can confirm, had 2 concussions my senior year of football and had to quit. Feel lazy as fuck but that's why I'm not an NBA player 
Excited to see what Mychal Thompson and Ayesha Curry have to say about this.
Ayesha is complaining about the refs on Twitter.
Elimination games have such a different vibe when you don\'t have a dog in the fight. Notes:\n\n* LeBron could probably lose all his limbs in a tragic hairline restoration accident and get a head coaching position in a wheelchair. For all his unreal physical attributes, basketball IQ is probably his greatest attribute. And that says a ton. Not to say that he doesn\'t space out, or lose focus at times, because everyone does, but the guy can see shit happening before it does. He can figure out plays before they\'re run, and that\'s not even counting the plays he can blow up because he MEMORIZED THEM. One day soon, we\'re gonna look back at dude\'s career and sit in awe, the same way we did with Kobe. \n\n* Speaking of Lebron, he did everything I wanted and went straight 2012-2013 mode. Jumper was wet, he was aggressive, and he seemed fully willing to drop 60 if needed. Legitimately dirty to watch. Somewhere, Kevin Garnett felt a cold chill from this one. \n\n* Don\'t get it twisted either: LeBron\'s resurgence is directly related to Draymond sitting out tonight. His defensive IQ is remarkable. Honestly, I think Draymond\'s relationship to Steph is similar to that of Pippen to MJ: they can be that terrifying defensively, largely because the best player(s) to guard them happen to be their teammate. Hopefully LeBron can carry that positive momentum in his jumper forward. \n\n* I\'m not sure what to think about Kevin Love. He regularly seemes to alternate between overly aggressive, with a trash BBIQ to match, and completely timid where he seems either prescient or frozen. He\'s talented, for sure, but I think that serious consideration to the offensive and defensive systems need to be made. He really seems like he\'s hitting a glass ceiling in his play, and I really hope he puts it together. What\'s more, I hope that the Cleveland Front Office has a similar faith and keep him. That said, dude was a non fucking factor on both ends. Probably a net negative, knowing that they forced switches to get him on Curry.\n\n* Iggy needs to keep starting imo. I definitely think that his hands, even only on the help side, are enough to keep the Cavs jittery, and off balance. He stuck LeBron a bit too much for my liking early, and didn\'t sag to give help. And it let Kyrie go straight the fuck off. Lue might have the makings of a pick your poison situation here: who do you want to torch you? If Kerr has to stretch Iggy, then, even with Draymond, that\'s a problem for the Dubs. \n\n* Shumpert looking like trash all series. Both with his hair and his game. \n\n* The Dubs were really good tonight. Tons of their usual screen action, cutting, things we\'ve seen all season. But they held on the same way they did against OKC. By being able to sink stupid shots at a huge distance. Being that superior from beyond the arc is really mind boggling. Look. Not to say that the Cavs didn\'t help with that: it\'s an elimination game and people were slow to close out. That\'s losing basketball.  \n\n* Golden State has gotta be happy. You needed a historical game by two superstars for them to steal a game. However, the floor tilts at home. I\'m interested to see how the champs step up. I\'m positive they\'ll come out swinging\n\n* Get better Bogut. \n\n* Refs get a B-/B for the first quarter. Half a grade docked for those Varejao flops, and another half for not calling a foul on that TT block on Klay.  \n\n* Y\'know what? I *almost* wish Golden State had taken us up on Harden for Thompson. Dude fits the OKC profile to a T: long, athletic and smart. The offense is a fucking bonus. Plus imagine Curry having been forced to learn to defend, playing next to Harden. \nSteph-Harden-Barnes-Draymond-Bogut vs. Russ-Klay-KD-Ibaka-Adams (pretend we still draft Adams). We deserve these teams people.\n\n* Andre Igoudala deserves to get seriously paid. Also on that list are Harrison Barnes, (probably) Speights and definitely Livingston. I want to see them get paid, not only because it would break up this unholy alliance of a bench, but also because, these guys deserve it. \n\n* LeBron deserves Finals MVP honors. Again. Fight me\n\n* Steph was relatively quiet again tonight. Not to say that he was a non factor (whattup K.Love), but the defense definitely took him out of his rhythm tonight. Once again, no disrespect, but its another series where Klay has done most of the heavy lifting. King Waffle Cone is gonna snap out of it eventually though. He always seems to. \n\n* Cavs uniforms tonight looked awful. Black with a big C. Really? Those uniforms are the closest thing to the physical embodiment of a double dribble. \n\n* Anderson Varejao is a ho. I honestly didn\'t like him jumping from one 1-seed to another, but to then flop like a flaccid dick in oversized boxers is extra. And then he goes to the line and misses the free throws? Pick a struggle you toilet brush shaped bastard.\n\n* Kyrie\'s development is the Cavs\' future. Honestly, I think that Kyrie\'s shown flashes of something truly special this postseason. It\'s gonna be great watching this kid grow. His jumper was beautiful, he passed into the pocket a couple of times, and, most importantly, he didn\'t sleep on defense. Dude absolutely blacked out, and what\'s worse he made it look effortless. The crazy thing is, that he did it against Klay and company. Draymond isn\'t his primary defender, so, assuming Draymond\'s softer defensive skills (i.e. communication) are equally neutralized by LeBron\'s IQ, then this might be repeatable.\n\n* UnderArmour still makes trash looking shoes. I don\'t care how long your commercials are, or how advanced your metrics, or technological advancements are. The Curry 2s are everything Twitter said they are. You spectactularly lucky sonsofbitches lucked into the most marketable, and singularly popular player since rookie LeBron. And you give him the most Payless looking shoes in the boundlessness of infinite possibility. Those shoes smell like Bass Pro Shops and "All Lives Matter". If Seth is smart, he\'ll take his free agent ass to Nike. \n\nAight, that\'s the analysis. I\'m gonna speak briefly about the LeBron v Draymond clusterfuck that\'s been going on the past few days. This sub has been packed with tweets from no-name writers, washed up ex players, and a bunch of no-flair, dry dick precum babies with nothing better to do. \n\n* I honestly do not care if LeBron got called a bitch. It\'s a grown man\'s league. Shit gets said all the time. LeBron, unfortunately, is too iconic for his own good. I don\'t even really like LeBron like that. I could give a fuck if you have kids: it\'s the Finals.\n\n* That being said, this contingent of people who seemingly are okay with calling people, and being called a bitch, is really confusing to me. Couple things on that note: there are quite possibly less than a dozen people on the continent who would legitimately run up on LeBron talking shit.  Don\'t act crazy, people. \n\n* My flair says everything you need to know about my honest feelings on Draymond. I like his game, but this man has touched more NBA penis in the past month and a half than most groupies. In fact, he got suspended because his last flagrant was literally an egregious and unnecessary touching of another man\'s meat. \n\n* LeBron has the right to not be called out of his name. And that\'s legitimate. But calling him sensitive is probably the most backasswards sentiment I\'ve seen this playoffs since "OKC should double Aldridge", and "Golden State is trash without Steph".\n \n * Sensistive is Klay\'s daddy having an opinion. And what\'s worse is it being a dumbass opinion. The greatest physical specimen in modern sports wouldn\'t be able to handle the physicality of the league? Coming from Mychal "I couldn\'t catch a Magic Johnson pass" Thompson? Aight. There\'s a reason Dell kept his damn mouth shut. \n\n * Steph is no better in my book. IDC how bad your wife is (straight fire), she doesn\'t get to subtweet like a jaded ex. Ayesha Curry probably picks fights with dudes built like Karl Malone and then says shit like "my man\'s gonna whoop your ass". Come get your wife the fuckouttahere. \n\n Had to get that out. Sorry. \n\nSeries isn\'t over until someone wins 4 games. Obviously. And, now, much like GS in Game 6 in the WCF, the Cavs are going back home, riding a high off a road win, and with plenty of positive momentum in both Kyrie\'s performance, and LeBron\'s revitalized shooting. The officiating was crisp, clean, and surprisingly balanced. Don\'t count either team out. Don\'t overreact. Just enjoy the next game. It\'s shaping up to a be a gorgeous one. 
What's with the subtweeting shit? I don't really follow twitter stuff but I'm interested. 
Trigger fingers turn to Twitter fingers
Barnes will get paid, but not because of these playoffs or anything he's done in these Finals. 
This was very insightful *and* entertaining... thank you.
I'm on vacation and missed most of the game -- thanks for doing this.

@garyowencomedy: Love is playing like there's 9 guys at the YMCA, he's on the treadmill & they ask him to play to make it 10.
Absolutely unreal, historic performances from Kyrie and LeBron. This is exactly what they needed to survive a road elimination game.\n\nThat said, I think there\xe2\x80\x99s very little takeaway from this game as it relates to the rest of the series. Draymond being back aside, Cleveland\xe2\x80\x99s offense and defense really didn\xe2\x80\x99t look different in this game than it did in their losses. They gave up a ton of open threes and their offense consisted of off-the-dribble, iso jumpers. The second half was the perfect storm of variance for them.\n\nExcited to see what adjustments, if any, both teams make in game six.\n
The Warriors had way fewer second chances on missed shots. That destroyed the Cavs in game 4. 
Really good point. They just hit shots they have been missing. And not to mention, Barnes was about 0/5 on WIDE open 3s in the 2nd half, and Curry missed 2 wide open 3s.\n\nTo quote the ingenious JVG, "IT\'s a make or miss league"...\n\nNot really. But truthfully, the Cavs hit a lot of tough shots they don\'t normally hit. Phenomenal performance. But replicable? I doubt it. 
It's not that we don't normally hit those shots. It's that we haven't been hitting them this series. Obviously tonight was particularly stellar, but it's not that uncommon for us to go off like that.
Kevin Love played like the Warriors are holding his sex tape. Klay had the most invisible 37 point game ever. 
It was pretty visible man. Dude was on fire from 3 
Dude was 6-8 from behind the arc at one point...
was not invisible in the first half
It wasn't invisible, he was on fire in the first half. It was just that LeBron remembered how to shoot and he and Irving went off while Klay had a pretty normal second half.
Well he is the least criticized super star in the league since Magic Johnson.
Unanimous!
Those last few minutes out there... were awful
##**Lebron and Kyrie had 41 a piece. Let that sink in**\n\nTrue display of greatness
This is true. But it has to suck being beat by two guys. 
But I thought LeBron's a bitch!
and lebron had 16 rebounds
And insane defence
Lebron had 41-16-7 on 53%. Kyrie had 41 on ~71%. Just absurd.
That 71% gives me chills.
71 percent?!?!?! WHAT THE UTTER FUCK?!?! MAMA THERE GOES THAT MAN!
And its not like most were easy shots either. Turn around fade away jumpers, high shots off glass through contact, quick 3s, he was all around hot
Uncle Drew and the King put on a clinic out there tonight. 
They were not about to take an L lol
The fucking defense in the second half was absurd.
Watching Kyrie going off is one of the best things to watch in the NBA. The degree of difficulty on some shots makes it so goddamn exciting. 
yup, he and kobe both go into those blind scoring modes. they don't see teammates, just the rim
It's the reason why I prefer watching Klay go off than Steph. Steph makes it look too easy. He has those fancy dribble moves that get him open looks. I mean not open by most players standards, but if there's not a hand directly in the face it's open for those two. Klay on the other hand does his best to shuffle half an inch to the right (and ends up going left on accident half the time), shoots it, and it still goes in.
He reminds of Rose with a lot of his shots. Fuck I miss rose
If Kyrie had Rose's leaping ability and overall explosiveness, this league would be fucked. 
Westbrook isn't nearly the shooter Kyrie is though. Combining Westbrook's athleticism and playmaking with Kyrie's shooting would probably be the greatest PG to step on the court. 
Just and incredible game from the big 3 today. LeBron, Kyrie and Love combine for 84 points. :)
Love contributing the big 2 points out there, really the MVP tonight. 
Love out there earning millions.

So after all the "other legends respond when they get trash-talked" and the "LeBron doesn\'t rise to the moment" horeshit that was spewed he goes out and gets 41/16/7/3/3 with just 2 turnovers and over 50% shooting in all areas. Just fucking hilarious how people are STILL to this day naive of his greatness and what he\'s capable of. 
I used to be a Lebron hater but man at some point you just gotta appreciate greatness. Won't see another player like him for a long time, maybe ever. 
When did I say this game lol wtf? I said I used to be a Lebron hater.
Even if the Cavs don\'t win this year, he\'s still one of the best to ever play the game. He has as many rings as Wilt Chamberlain and as many as Olajuwon and as many as the Bad Boys (other than Dennis Rodman). More than Carmelo, Dwight, Chris Paul, KD, Westbrook and Harden (who still have chances to win one, obviously). More than TMac, Grant Hill, Chris Webber, Vince Carter, Steve Nash, George Gervin, Dominique, Mutombo, Reggie Miller, AI, Ewing, Stockton, Malone, Barkley, and Elgin Baylor combined (no rings between them). Players like Dirk, KG, Paul Pierce, Jerry West, Oscar, Clyde, Jason Kidd, Gary Payton, and Moses Malone only ever won one ring. There\'s never been a player like LeBron before. No one has ever had his combination of size and speed, the closest might be Magic Johnson and James has at least 30 pounds on him. No one has ever had the physical gifts or the kind of game that James has. Even the haters will look back and tell their grandkids "I saw the King play." We\'ll all certainly talk about other greats of this era too, like Kobe and Shaq and KD probably Steph too. We\'ll probably always debate who the best was in this era. But none of us will forget to mention James in that conversation. Our grandkids will roll their eyes at us the way we all rolled our eyes at people who saw Cousy or Oscar or Wilt or Russell play (or for some watching the NBA today, even the stories of Bird and Magic and the Bad Boys and maybe even Jordan too). They\'ll say "Lebron and Kobe combined couldn\'t be as good genetically modified superhuman XXXXX XXXXXX." And we\'ll sit back, sure in our knowledge that our generation was superior to these genetically modified superhuman whipper snappers in the league today. We\'ll smile knowingly, each of us remembering that we saw one of the greatest players to ever step foot on the hardwood. Even the haters.

This subreddit is the worst
it really is
Where can I get my ticket punched for the "Shit on Kevin Love" conference? That\'s today\'s story, right?
Reddit these past 2 days has been an overall shitshow
It's hilarious how all of /r/NBA was pissed when Draymond wasn't suspended and then angrier when he did it again and was suspended. ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINED??
You mean /r/the_donald dominating /r/all for months with memes and posts about "faggots"? Ya Reddit is in some dark times now that every 10 year old is on here daily
The censorship is honestly better than those threads just being brigaded by the Donald with anti Muslim propaganda. Reddits problem is that it tries to advertise itself as an open minded website while housing some pretty serious reactionaries. 
Sports subreddits are really the only place I can escape that garbage. Thank god for this summer. Copa America, Euro Cup, NBA Finals, and the Olympics?\n\nIt's all I could ever ask for in a non-World Cup year. 
They\'ll say it\'s all for the \'lulz,\' but back them into a corner and they\'re actually very concerned about "white culture" and "white pride" and all that BS.
I can't wait for the offseason here.
At least we don't have to hear about 400 longsnapper signings here.
Off-season OC is the best
This sub was just a LeBron hate train after Game 4, now everyone will be sucking LeBron's dick until we get the results of Game 6.
I'd say the entire finals, specially the first 2 day break after game 1.
The amount of people who were saying he doesn't show up in big games or was a choke artist was ridiculous, and they were all getting upvoted.\n\nOOOO BABY
Everybody on this sub remembers the last 2 games they watched and nothing more. Actually I'm almost certain a lot of the commenters here don't even watch the games so they basically remember the box score of the last 2 games
Don't worry if he scores 25 next game and they lose he's back to LeCHOKE on this sub. 
I wish I could say the narrative would change but he's done it before and it still won't go away. Dude gets unbelievable hate
Barnes, on the other hand, did *not* play like a guy hoping to get maxed this year.
Get ready, it's going to happen. Young 3+D player is very desirable.
He was brutal. Missing wide open three pointers, dropping passes, missing around the rim, just bad.
Definitely reminded me of Game 7 against the Spurs the way he was taking all those shots. Blame him for 2011, but since then he never quits 
I think this is his 3rd greatest playoff game ever. Only Game #6 vs Boston and Game #7 vs San Antonio are higher because one of them was blueprint-defining and other was Championship-defining. But man... if Cleveland goes on to win Game #6, the legend of this game will only grow. Felt SO much fun watching it considering all the shit that was posted about him after Game #4 and shit, just look at the front-page and it's old NBA players criticizing him getting upvoted to the top. 
Dog. I know it won you a championship and you're gonna overrate it. But you're high if you think game 7 2013 was better than game 5 in 07 ecf. I can't even put into words that game. 1v5 for an entire quarter plus ot. 29 of last 30 and last 25. Against one of the best defensive cores in the last 30 years. Fuck outta here 
I\'d put 2007 ECF Finals Game #5 up there too. He\'s 22 years old and in his fourth year in the league. It\'s only the second playoff trip for him. He\'s in a series that is tied 2-2 against a team that they lost to in the second round the previous year, and who are in the ECF for the fifth straight year, including two finals trips and title. The whole series was close, with the first five games being decided by six points or less. The Pistons won the first two at home, the Cavs won the next two at home. Game 5 was in Auburn Hills, game seven would be as well if the teams kept trading home wins. The Cavs would have to win one in Detroit to go to their first NBA Finals.\n\nThe Pistons were up by 7 with 3:15 to go in the fourth. The Cavs needed a 10-3 run to tie the game and send it to overtime. LeBron scored 9 of those 10 points. The game ended up going to double OT. LeBron scored 48 points that game, including his team\'s last ***25 POINTS*** and 29 of his team\'s final 30. He\'s the only player to score in overtime for the Cavs. He\'s the only player on the Cavs to score in the last 12:49, and the only player for the Cavs to make a field goal in the last 17:48.\n\nI\'ve never doubted his ability or his will to win since that game. Yeah, he\'s had bad games. Some of his seasons have ended with not such great moments for him and his teams. But the guy proved very early in his career that he was clutch and could carry a team. Yeah, they got wiped out by the Spurs that Finals, but they had no business being there in the first place. LeBron is the only reason that team made it even that far. For all the LeBron doubters and haters, just tell them to watch 2007 ECF Finals Game 5. He\'s always been able to come through when it mattered.\n\nEven if the Cavs don\'t win this year, he\'s still one of the best to ever play the game. He has as many rings as Wilt Chamberlain and as many as Olajuwon and as many as the Bad Boys (other than Dennis Rodman). More than Carmelo, Dwight, Chris Paul, KD, Westbrook and Harden (who still have chances to win one, obviously). More than TMac, Grant Hill, Chris Webber, Vince Carter, Steve Nash, George Gervin, Dominique, Mutombo, Reggie Miller, AI, Ewing, Stockton, Malone, Barkley, and Elgin Baylor combined (no rings between them). Players like Dirk, KG, Paul Pierce, Jerry West, Oscar, Clyde, Jason Kidd, Gary Payton, and Moses Malone only ever won one ring. There\'s never been a player like LeBron before.

That was a fuck you game if I've ever seen it. 
> ~~when you suspend Dray.~~\n\nwhen Dray gets himself suspended.
We are all witness 
Fuck you I'm LeBron James
Let's see...\n\n* Game high minutes\n* Game high points\n* Game high (offensive/defensive/total) rebounds\n* Game high assists\n* Game high blocks\n* Game high steals\n\n...yep, *fuck you* game confirmed.
So refreshing 
It's what we've all been waiting for. If Kevin Love figures out how to play basketball then we could have an amazing game 7
When the retired players, your opponents, "analysts", fans all call you a bitch, and a whiner. Don\'t say anything. Just ruin them the next game.\n\nThat\'s called taking the high road.
He proved today why he's still the all-around best player in the NBA
And also what a joke Steph Curry's unanimous MVP is...
oh come on now\n\ndude led a team to the best regular season of all time while draining 400+ 3s, breaking the old record by a fucking mile. While shooting a damn good TS%.\n\ni don't give a shit if Lebron is still a better player right now, Steph deserved that
All-around best player to ever play the game **\n\nedit: I never said best to play (although I have LeBron number 2 all time behind Jordan) but I think in terms of every aspect of the game we haven't seen a better all around player in terms of rebounding, scoring, assisting, and defense 
I saw them both at their peak in person, and I'm taking LBJ 1st 
You are crazy.
That's exactly what a crazy person would say.
I disagree with that, but I will not continue this further.
That sounds crazy and I need to know why lol. Jordan is almost a myth how could anyone compete with that?
Jordan is mythical. He was a god. \n\nWhat Lebron is doing and has done over the last 10 years is Jordan's equal. \n\nI've made a bunch of posts on this topic, but what it comes down to is that Lebron is physically impossible and bends the game around his will in all phases more than anyone I've ever seen.\n\nHe's a force of nature, and you saw it tonight - something, even if the cavs lose this series, even though kyrie had 41, LeBron had 14 more rebs and 2 more blocks and 2 tos, and has played more tha 3k minutes more than any player in the NBA since 2007 -\n\nHe's a titan and were watching history. Enjoy it.
Don't downvote to disagree, no matter how wrong he is
Now I wouldn't say that. I watched Jordan play and the closest LeBron got to Jordan was 2013. His game was damn near complete for the whole season.
No hate here because I\'m a big LeBron fan and am hoping the Cavs come back (if only to see LeBron reel off a historic string of games; same reason I cheered for the Cavs last year, because if they won it would\'ve meant that LeBron went absolutely god-mode), but I think "best all around" should still be given to MJ. LeBron has better natural passing instincts than Jordan, but Jordan\'s won a DPOY and had a season where he averaged *32/8/8*. Most impressive post-merger stat line imo (nothing can top Wilt\'s 50/25). He also had 5 other seasons where he averaged 6.5+ assists per game, so although LeBron has the edge in the category, I don\'t think it\'s quite as large as one would expect at first thought. LeBron has played DPOY-level defense in the past, and an argument could be made that he deserved it in \'13 I believe. Overall though, I think Jordan was just too good a scorer and was at worst, as impressive as LeBron at defense (and was slightly better imo), and is a hair behind LeBron in terms of playmaking ability. Once again, no disrespect to Bron, but I think a healthy case can be made for Jordan here as well
LeBron has 4 and should have legit 6, and that's by age 31.
Kinda hard to say this after the game we just watched, but I think where LeBron pales in comparison to Jordan is the flashy, clutch plays that Jordan and Kobe dazzled people with. LeBron doesn't have an above-average shot (it was there tonight, but it usually isn't). He doesn't break people's ankles or cash in fadeaway 3s from 30 feet, and it doesn't even seem like he has that breathless, edge-of-your-seat playmaking ability. A few cool dunks and real bursts of athleticism when he chases down blocks, but a lot of the time it almost looks like he's playing slowly (I think that's both an ode to his Basketball IQ and his athleticism, but it sometimes dims the spotlight). He's not overtly loud, he's not a showman, and he actually seems pretty subdued and thoughtful most of the time. \n\nI mean compare his statline to Kyrie's tonight, and everyone was talking about Kyrie's game like it was the most amazing performance they've ever seen when LeBron pretty much did the same thing. LeBron is just consistently consistent. No particular skillset maxed out to 100, but a more thoroughly well-rounded, overall skillset than anyone else, possibly ever.
Really good points, but I think it's still a toss up. While Jordan's definitely the better scorer due to the volume he could put up, I think LeBron's insane efficiency should factor in a bit. His two .640 and .649 TS% seasons were spectacular. Given that he's edged out Jordan a hair in rebounding too, one doesn't seem to be clearly ahead of the other. 
That's a really great point, I forgot to factor in efficiency as well. God damn I'm happy we get to see this dude playing (wish I could've seen more of Jordan than I was able to :/)
MJ also accepted male pattern baldness and shaved his head. LeBron is still lacking in that area. 
MJ couldn't rock the headband, tho
The fact that we can make such a good comparison of lebron to the best player ever says volumes.  He's an athletic monster and deserves the good recognition not hate.. 
Yeah sorry but that argument is bull shit (no pun intended). The Bulls built a better team around Jordan while he was there, so he didn't have to chase championships. LeBron's second best player was probably Zydrunas Ilgauskas, and LeBron knew he wasn't going to win with that team during his first tenure there. 
Question his character? The Decision was stupid, but that's the only bad thing he's ever done. And it wasn't even that bad. You'd beard pressed to find a more upstanding superstar in any sport
not to mention all the proceeds from the decision went to underprivileged youth at boys and girls club of america.. yeah, sure, it might have rubbed people the wrong way but lebron is one of the best role models in all of sports 
Yeah Jordan threw a fit at home until they did what Lebron basically did in Miami, what the Cavs wouldn't do
Pretty sure if Scotty showed up in Cleveland Lebron would have stayed. 
Never even needed proof. Hes obvious still the best in the game and for anyone to argue otherwise is ridiculous. Yes, Steph won MVP and I understand that. But everybody knows Lebron is the best in the business.
I honestly think LeBron basically entered the MJ zone as far as MVPs go.  Where the press just gets tired of giving it to the same guy every single year so they ignore him.
Stop putting unnecessary labels. He IS the best player in the NBA. Steph is arguably the best pure scorer right now but he has a great supporting cast. We saw tonight that Draymond is a glue to this team and without him they're not the same defensively. This might sound reactionary, but Steph isn't in the same category as LeBron when it comes to leading a team both on and off the court. 
Only having two turnovers was HUGE
He saw a post on here about his turnover record.\n\nLeBron nodded.
And one was the first possession. Just one the rest of the way.
The second was in absolute garbage time too. 
LeBron lead or tied his team in Points, rebounds, assists, steals and block, what a huge fucking game by him
And that's with one teammate getting 41 points and another getting 15 rebounds... unreal.
KYRIE YOU'RE FUCKING FIRE. \n\nLEBRON YOU PLAYED GREAT AS WELL. \n\nKEVIN YOU WERE SHIT AS USUAL
LeBron James tonight: "The reports of my death have been greatly exaggerated. Oh, and suck a big bag of dicks /r/NBA."  
Fuck you /r/NBA, - LeBron
Fuck you r/NBA- any Cavs fan thats been around for the last 72 hours. 
The way Cavs fans got downvoted like crazy was pathetic.
just shows that the jokes about warriors fans being immature middle schoolers might not be jokes haha 
LeBron probably doesn't even know Reddit exists.
You know LeBron is on Reddit mobile after the game trying to find a way to filter /r/the_donald like the rest of us.
Oh Jesus Christ. I can't even browse r/all anymore. \n\nI can't believe that there are people that think Donald fucking Trump has the answers to all these problems.
thank god it's not just me
Seeing these posts is a huge relief, that reddit hasn't been completely taken over by trump supporters
And then when you do filter it, your frontpage becomes a barren wasteland lmao. My frontpage has 9 posts right now
For real, though, how is that sub so popular? 
A bunch of people with no jobs, non american trolls, and bots.
Trump is really good at getting the crazies on that side. They hate everybody over there. 
The mods have instructed the users to monitor the /new queue and upvote everything. They literally have a sticky up tonight, from a mod, welcoming the "night crew" that says:\n\n> I plan to give us a two front war to dominate this cuckold site and voat.\n\nThe upvote-to-comment ratio is insanely out of whack compared to the rest of Reddit. They don\'t operate like a normal sub with mixed upvotes and downvotes based on the quality of the content and biases of the subscribers. They just subserviently upvote the shit out of everything.
>I plan to give us a two front war to dominate this cuckold site and voat.\n\nLmao those motherfuckers legit think upvoting posts on reddit is gonna change the world?  Holy shit my brain.

Draymond Green died for this
https://twitter.com/iLowkeyB/status/742566402372993025
This game just confirms Draymond's value to the Warriors' system
Kevin Love ropes Dray into a ball kick Tech 2.\nDRAY SUSPENDED REST OF SERIES.\nCAVS WIN.\nLOVE WINS PLAYOFF MVP.
Seriously, they missed him sorely. Of course Lebron and Kyrie had amazing games, but you could see how Lebron was not being challenged at the rim nearly as much as he was before.
Which is why I like discussing what MVP actually means, I honestly think Draymond despite all the reasons I dislike him had just as much justification as Steph for 'most valuable'. Without 1 of them you don't get to 73. The difference is that if you don't have Steph for a week you can probably win all your games that week. I think if you don't have Draymond you have a good chance of dropping one, I think that's the difference.
True, no way James and Irving would have scored 41 each if Draymond was on the court.
Kyrie would have but not Lebron. 
Yeah, there's even a chance Kyrie would've had more than 41 because in this game he had to share offense with someone else who was also unstoppable. If LeBron was somewhat neutralized, Uncle Drew gets the ball even more.
And more importantly, Draymond's presence seems to make the Warriors tick emotionally. They just seemed kind of lost out there in the 4th quarter without him.
Yea I think draymond is the one that fires them up
Nooooo shitttt
Honestly it hurts them on offense just as much, he's invaluable to their spacing and passing attack\n\nThat PnR is deadly
He's now a lock for FMVP if they win the series.
That would be so fun on here
At the same time, it shows you why Cleveland ran through the east in general. Without Draymond, Kyrie and LeBron just took what they wanted. Basically without a top 3 defender, there is no way to stop the Cavs. 
Our small ball ain't shit without Draymond at center. 
**HOIST IT BABY!**\n\nWE\'RE GOING BACK TO THE LAND BABY! WE\'RE STAYING ALIVE!\n\n\nLEBRON WITH A NEW "GAME 6". KYRIE WITH A DOMINANT PERFORMANCE.\n\n**HOIST IT BABY!**\n\nhttps://streamable.com/91jq \n\n\n*THIS MAY HURT YOUR EARS.*

[OH LEBRON JAAAAAAMES, HE'S GOT THE HEART OF A LION AND THE WILL OF A BEAR!](https://streamable.com/xsfs)
I think I just watched that about 17 times in a row. So catchy. 
wow that was long lmao
What the flying horse fuck 
When did you finish making this?  In the middle of the Q4?
yes
You are tempting fate my friend
Guys, I think a "b*tch" just dropped 41/16/7 on a 73 win team lol 
You can only play what's in front of you. Warriors are a great defensive *team* and Kyrie/LeBron still dropped 82 on them.
Nah iggy played homie
Yeah dude, anyone can put up 41/16/7
Man if only there was a way to avoid hitting people in the balls and accumulating flagrants...
Kinda give that one to iggy 
He just did something no one has ever done in the finals. Good fucking lord some people will hate on anything.\n\nEDIT: Lot of you saying that there best defender was suspended. Lot of you conveniently forgetting that Iggy is their best defender against Lebron. Draymond would have helped and certainly have lessened Lebrons prodcution, but let's not act like he just put up that statline against a shitty defensive team.
Uhhhh if you're talking in terms of guarding Lebron, then I think Andre Iguodala was on the court. But yes Draymond was not there, which would have helped. Still, it's not like Lebron was facing a high school team. He just dropped that crazy statline... in the finals. 
He's also not wrong 
I mean I think Iggy does a better job one on one against LeBron. Not to discredit Draymond.
Draymond isn't even the best lebron defender on that team. 
Some people will hate on **EVERYTHING** LeBron does, no matter what. 
So we're gonna act like Iguodala doesn't always guard LeBron anyways? \n\nCome on man. 
Pretty sure iggy played
Green got rid of himself by consistently being a crotch-hitting asshole.
Lebron and Kyrie just dad dicked all over GSW...
To be fair, Draymond wasn't playing. I think he would have had a significant impact on the game. 
think this game shows how central draymond is to the warriors defense. felt like they couldnt get a defensive stop at all without him.
You're allowed to swear on the internet
That was LeBron\'s "fuck you" game
He actually did it last year without any help.
Wasn't his first, hopefully not his last.. 
Need 2 more for the real fuck you.
Damn had you guys heard of this dude before? Outta nowhere too my mans should be paid to play this game for real
I'm gonna be honest.... I never knew who LeBron James was before tonight.\n\nDis guy gone go plases.
Yo I think he might be the next big thing just give him a few more years to adjust 
This is gonna be your subreddit in a while.\n\n-Tim Duncan to LeBron
What happened to curry? Oh yeah, it's the finals. 
1st ever unanimous MVP (and back to back MVP) will win 2 straight NBA finals without winning finals MVP....what the actual fuck 
lol at all the people shitting on Lebron.
Warriors fans fleeing /r/nba quicker than the fans fleeing the Oracle Arena.
BAH GAWD THEY HAD A WAGON!
~~Lakers~~ ~~Miami~~ Warriors fans feeling /r/nba quicker than the fans fleeing the Oracle Arena.
I love how people say this after every loss as if they're just supposed to show up and get trashed over flair regardless of what they say
How do you have a crowd that loud and fans that leave early? It can't be that they pump in noise...
dude dont complain about traffic it's fucking 9pm and the oracle isn't located in downtown or something.
Yeah man 9pm is rush hour in California don't you know /s
The Oracle got its reputation before they became $18,000 seats.
Oh its always been loud! Not this loud. It's noticeably louder than thunder games and I've been to a thunder playoff game. The people are all going fucking nuts, one of the loudest arenas I've ever been in. If the noise isn't pumped in, I have no idea how they can get that much more noise in an older stadium with less acoustics with the same number of people inside. It just makes no sense.\n\nLike I've been on the field at nfl games that were less raucous that my nosebleeds at the thunder 
Disgraceful as when Heat fans left the arena back in the day. No respect for people who pay thousands of dollars and leave early

Lebron 41 pt /16 rb/7 ast /3 stl/3 blk\n\nWhat a performance to silence the critics. This man is unbelievable

I love how lebron just gave everyone a big cup of shut the fuck up, myself included. Dude is amazing. 
Although it worked out for them tonight, the Cavs did exactly the same thing that has lost them 3 games this series: James and Irving iso's in the 4th quarter. I highly doubt Kyrie and LeBron can keep up that ridiculous efficiency for 2 more games though, especially with Green coming back next game.
Thank god Lebron had another one of his signature games so the dumbass trolls will shut the fuck up!\n\nAnd shout out to Kyrie too holy fuck some of the shots he made were completely out of this world.
I forgot iggy didn't play either... dumbass
I first thought the trolls will shut the fuck up. But wait and see how everyone makes it look like the ONLY reason Cleveland won was because Draymond was out. I always that the LeBron haters just went away after 2012. But they're just waiting for him to fuck up and the trolls be trollin'. Very sad really.
that three while falling down was insane. 
Most of his shots were insane man.
Why are the Warriors 2-0 without the first ever unanimous MVP and 0-1 with out Draymond "Dick Hunter" Green? 
>Dick Hunter \n\nFucking lmao
They're 4-2 in the playoffs without Curry fwiw.
Damn, so proud of Kyrie. \n\nShowing up the 2 time MVP. It's closer than you guys think, he's amazing in his own right. \n\nGreat performance.
Gotta leave early and beat the traffic. I mean this was a regular season game, yeah?
wallets too heavy, cant stand up
they should not give Varejao a ring b/c his flopping is a disgrace to the game
Looks like Dray is the real \xe2\x80\x9cMost Valuable Player\xe2\x80\x9d
I started prepping for Game 6 once the Bogey man went out.... We really couldn't compensate for his early exit
This game nailed down the Finals MVP for **Draymond Green**
[The real losers tonight were all the wealthy bandwagon Warriors fans taunting LeBron all night.](http://i.imgur.com/uBzUERv.jpg)
Brevity is the essence of wit, sign guy
Same.
Jesus man. That sign is so pathetic...
Yup. Looks like a culmination of the game 4 post game thread...
There were a couple missed calls here and there but overall this game was called as evenly as one could hope for in the NBA Finals. Great job to the refs.\n\nGotta give it up for LeBron and Kyrie.\n\nI wish LeBron would go to the press conference and open it up with "So is that what a bitch does when they\'re facing elimination on the road?" but I know something like that would never happen. Great game. We\'ve got another one.
I would love if he opened it up with, "Well, this is a grown man\'s game, right?"
Time to pile on Steph.\n\nBut seriously, why wasn't he the ball handler in the 4th?  They needed him to go off, and he couldn't get separation with Shump on him.  Shump is a perfectly fine defender, but we've seen Steph shred way better defenders than that.
Damn it would be incredible if this series went to seven games. Only a few days ago it seemed like this would be an easy 4-1 win for the Warriors, but after tonight I honestly don't know who I'd take in a potential game 7. \n\nSay what you want about the win being tainted because of the Warriors losing Draymond but performances like LBJ's and Kyrie's are why I love playoff basketball and will always love playoff basketball.\n\nGame 6 here we come!
Lebron in game 4\n"It\'s all about getting free tacos for the land baby"\n\n\nLebron in game 5\n"It\'s all about getting free tacos for the land baby"
I was terrified of a warriors comeback till like 30 seconds left in the game
Curry plays badly: remember that injury nagging him a couple weeks ago?\n\nLove plays badly: nobody has any memory of the fact his brain rattled around in his skull 3 games ago
Some say Harrison Barnes is still missing open 3's
Series is going to 7 games. I don't see the Cavs losing game 6, if Kyrie and Lebron continue with the dad-dicking. I think that Draymond may play cautiously because another flagrant means a game 7 suspension. \n\nJust a shame that Draymond put himself and the team in that situation by not being able to control himself. If I am Lue, then I definitely make sure to tell my players to antagonize him in game 6. \n
Probably not overly likely, but if someone other than Kyrie/LeBron can actually show up on offense, they won't have to score 41.\n\nAt this point...I've got zero predictions for what happens. I could see Draymond firing the team back up and they close it on the road. I could see the Cavs continuing the momentum on their home court. \n\nHonestly, I'm just hoping it goes 7. I don't want basketball to end.
I mean, 53% shooting beats 36% shooting damn near every time. I can't say with ANY confidence that scenario will happen again.\n\nThey get Dray back game 6 and I don't see the Cavs shooting that hot and the Warrirors that cold again. Let's be honest with ourselves here.
They can't continue Kyrie/LeBron ISO and expect to win.  Only works when they shoot out of their mind.
[This pretty much sums up the game.](http://i.imgur.com/dGQ8Di7.png)

As much as people criticise Lebron and call him a bitch, you gotta respect his greatness to deliver an epic performance on the road to stave of elimination 
How the hell is Harrison Barnes worth anything more than $2?
What a game from Kyrie and LeBron. Many people (myself included) consistently doubt LeBrons mental toughness but yet again he puts on that stone cold face and puts up huge numbers. LeBron played that game beautifully, he picked his spots correctly and hit jumpers confidently like he is fully capable of. When you come at the King (I\'m talking to you Warriors fans) you best not miss. Boo LeBron and you have the assassin on your hands. Kyrie fed off that calm and controlled vibe of LeBron and absolutely ICED the game in the 4th with those 3 straight buckets. The handle on that boy is ridiculous, he may not be a "top 5 point guard" but that man can straight up play basketball, he gets buckets which is ultimately what the game is all about. What a game, stealing a game decidedly in a RAGING Oracle arena. Can\'t wait to see how both teams come out next game in the Q
So annoyed by Cavs jacking up long jumpers against GSW super-small lineup. Makes no sense... It worked because Kyrie was on fire but that doesn't make it smart.
As Currys season has shown us..\n\nIt's smart if it goes in.
No homo but Kyrie's voice is buttery smooth
Im here to overreact !!\n- Kyrie Irving is the new AI\n- K Love is absolute trash \n- Curry is overrated \n- Varejao is the GOAT flopper\n- These playoffs refs are the worst of all time 
No but seriously what else can they do to make this series last longer?  Send all ideas to Adam.Silver@nba.com Subject: The Search for More Money. 
Warriors regular season 73-9\n\nWarriors post season 15-9*\n\n*TBA 2016/06/19\n\ne: Fuckin' nailed it
Ayesha *totally* taking the HIGH ROAD: https://twitter.com/ayeshacurry/status/742567393277267969
So agree. Particularly where the refs bailed out the Cavs by pardoning them of their offensive possession when Kyrie dribbled the ball within about 10 inches of the sideline and then again when Iggy threw up a shot attempt that hit neither defender nor basket and then caught it a few steps later.  Like, just what Ty Lue wanted.
First take did some dumb thing before the finals started, asking 'if the Cavs had prime Kobe instead of Lebron, would the Cavs stand a better chance in this series?'\n\nKyrie just responded, 'Why not both?'

**PUSH IT TO SEVEN, CLEVELAND.**
Call that man a bitch one more time.. No, seriously, please call Lebron a bitch again. Pretty sure it unlocks Lebron's 2015 god mode
i said........... <-<..... >->...... biiiiiiiiiiiittttttcccchhhhhhhh\n
when LeBron has confidence in taking jumpshots, the Cavs win, and thats it
If LeBron wins this, it will just be put down because people will say NBA helped him win with Dray suspensions and such. Smh
That was a really gutsy win from the Cavs today. Kyrie was insanely good, as was LeBron. I really hope they can take the next game at home, but I can see the Warriors winning Game 6. If the Cavs take it to 7, that would be very impressive and anything can happen in Game 7. I'm not exactly a fan of either team but I would really love to see the Cavs win this series. \n\nI've watched LeBron's whole career and have never been a fanboy or a hater, but nobody can deny the dude can fucking ball. In my opinion, he is definitely the best player in the league and easily in the top 3-5 most skilled players ever (I'm talking purely based on skill-set here). Curry has had two phenomenal seasons, but to me he is overrated. That's not taking anything away from the guy and what he can do, but I just can't believe that he is spoken about as an 'all-time' player so often in the media. He needs several more seasons playing at this high level to be in that discussion, IMO. \n\nI will always prefer guys that take it to the hole over 3-point shooters so maybe I am biased in that respect. Don't get me wrong, Curry is probably already the best shooter ever and he is very good at other things also. But to me, watching LeBron play basketball is like watching Messi play football, you can just see that he is the best.
/u/Rabsho came buckets
Kyrie isn\'t an elite scorer -r/nba 5 days ago 
LeBron has done historically well in elimination games. Tonight was no different. Not surprised at all. Still don't get why so many bash him. 
How about we all appreciate LeBron's greatness instead of calling him a bitch for the next three days this time. That was amazing.
Nope. This sub was almost unbearable the last few days, almost like an espn comment section. It was embarrassing. People take his game for granted.
Live by the 3, die by the 3
Super good performance by Kyrie and LeBron.\n\nYou could see how LeBron was full on win mode. He didn't show any emotion after his blocks or dunks, he just kept playing. He didn't even complain about the ref calls. \nIf any, that was a true ''fuck you, I'm winning this'' game by Lebron.\n\nMan I love seeing Kyrie light up. He was banking shots at very hard spots. 
Cavs in 7. \n\nIt's not wrong when you're right.
Yeah, just need Kyrie and LeBron to duplicate this two more times and get Green suspended again.
well, they go home where cold streaks are even colder and hot streaks shouldnt last long for the warriors. i think they can squeeze out a win. and game 7 is a toss up, who knows. lebron would be ONE WIN away from getting a ship, i think he can empty the tank for a game again
But they've taken a game already while Green played 
im just satisfied knowing all the last minute warrior fans paid to celebrate the championship and were let down.
Can we establish now after a Cleveland win that both teams are great, Warriors are historically great, curry deserved mvp, Lebron is in the goat conversation, and there's no need to go back and forth with reactionary hate after every damn game?
Shout out to everyone on this sub who said that the Cavs were better off in the Finals last year starting Dellavedova instead of Kyrie
Looks like the 'pussy' just dropped 41 whilst playing in a 'man's league'. Damn what a Fucking rebuttal.
That was an amazing game, and the Kyrie and LeBron played great, but they went about 6 minutes in that fourth quarter where I don't think the Cavs made a single pass on offense.  That shit isn't going to fly with Draymond back, it's the same reason that they got stomped in the 4th quarter of game 4.  Just this time the shots were falling, but they weren't high percentage shots.\n\nSecond point, LeBron was a monster defensively this game too, that was just a ridiculous performance on both ends.
The UNC products killed GSW tonight. In what world is Barnes a max player?\n\nAgain, I still can't believe that McAdoo was a likely lottery pick if he left after his freshman year. He is awful.
[He had it planned all along](http://imgur.com/xVVGLRH)
If he walked with a boner into a wall, he would break his nose.
Aaaaaaand the Curry Bandwagon is back to being salty as fuck
http://imgur.com/6FWUA8X
i'm not mad at the fans leaving for 2 reasons:\n\nfirst, they cut the lead to 6, and then played the final 6+ minutes without a field goal.\n\nthen, kerr put a scrub lineup on the floor.\n\nthe team gave up, why can't the fans?
Steph 3/13 in the second half? Bitch made IMO.
Looks like the Warriors can win without Steph but not without Green. Draymond is the real engine of the Warriors.
Kyrie Irving has a more complete offensive game than Steph Curry. He's also 4 years younger. He could be scary(ier?) in a couple years. 
Congrats NBA, you got exactly what you wanted. \n\nEDIT: Lol I'm not mad the Cavs won, and Kyrie and LeBron obviously went off. However the way the NBA has handled the playoffs and these decisions is clearly flawed. They clearly saw this game as expendable because the Warriors were up 3-1, now it's 3-2 and Bogut has a torn knee most likely. I just wish they would have suspended Draymond when he deserved it and not when it was the easiest.\n\nEDIT 2: I'm not sure if I'm not being clear or what, but I don't care who won the game. I'm upset at the NBA making decisions based on more than the play itself. It's hard not to think that OKC and their fans got fucked over because the NBA felt the game mattered too much for Draymond to miss, yet this one didn't and ultimately furthered their interested by extending the series. 
hahaha look at these warriors fans downvoting everyone, even a neutral comment like this one. pathetic
Ya! FUCK YOU NBA. You let LeBron and Kyrie combine for 80+! Oh, and you make Curry played like horse shit to
Not their fault Curry fucking sucked (to his standards)
Klay had to carry the Warriors again
Green is a grown ass man and should take responsibility for his own actions. \n\nHe's a dirty player and should have been suspended earlier for all his dirty plays in the past few weeks
It's Draymond fault for even being in that position
The NBA should have suspended him when he deserved it, not when it was easiest.
I mean, culmination he did deserve it, it was just late and at a most conspicuous time
He would have just been suspended again lol
Or OKC could have been in the finals, I think that's where more of the salt comes from 
They fucking choked and it's entirely their own fault.
> The NBA should have suspended him when he deserved it\n\nif they'd suspended him when he deserved, the warriors might not have even made it to the finals
Which would have been a deserved outcome.
Nah, he would've been suspended for Game 4 in the WCF, which the Warriors got blown out in anyway. 
what?\n\nyeah, no shit, that's not even close to what we're talking about
I bet Draymond gets baited into a flagrant on Delly in Game 6 (for automatic Game 7 suspension) and he's going to go so ape-shit crazy he punches a ref in the the mouf like Kermit Washington did to Rudy Tomjanovich and kills a man on national TV. That's my prediction.
http://i.imgur.com/aFAEVUU.jpg
Ah and now we get to see /r/nba turn from /r/warriors to /r/cavs.
HOUSE OF KYRIE - "WHAT IS DEAD MAY NEVER DIE, BUT RISES AGAIN FOR SHOT AFTER SHOT"
I see LeBron is sharing his Elimination Game buff with Kyrie holy shit those two.
Their needs to be an organized and concerted effort to taunt Green at the Q. Everything short of racial slurs need to be hurled at him. He's a garbage person and it's gamesmanship at its finest.
So since when was swinging at a guys crotch because they disrespected you considered manly? Like I legit am laughing that people are defending a man for trying to smack another mans crotch... Only in sports xD
I don't want to hear this Lebron chokes shit anymore. This man played his fucking heart out!\n\n
If James Harden were to play defense like Curry is right now, then the front page would be trashing his ass all day.
Kyrie grew up today and LBJ answered his critics. Thank god.
41-16-7-3-3\n\nWow. 
It took superhuman efforts from Kyrie and LeBron and nobody on the Warriors but Klay showing up (Draymond literally) to win this game and it was close until mid-4th. Cleveland fans should have their buttcheeks fully clenched in Game 6.
FUCK ADAM SILVER
Ayesha Curry just tweeted "It\'s amazing how quick you all are to call me out of my name and wish pain on my family and I\'ve never used one obscenity or foul word back." \n\nNow I agree that the people who wish harm on her family and call her names need to get a life but isn\'t this almost the exact same thing LeBron said? The reporter asked him what he thought about Klay saying he got his feelings hurt and LeBron said it\'s tough to always take the high road.\n\nMrs. Curry then tweets, "High Road. invisible bridge used to step over said person when open floor is available left to right." \n\nMind you this had nothing to do with what Klay said. I think that\'s was pretty damn hypocritical to be honest. 
Knee jerk reactions. Get your knee jerk reactions here. 
So how long until Curry crosses over into the territory that allows for criticism of a string of mediocre performances?
I know no team has ever comeback 3-1 in the finals but I want Lebron to do it sooo fucking bad. I really want the Warriors to feel our pain. Fucking Curry and Klay with their 2k cheese 3 pointers.
Some days you get the bitch, some days the bitch gets you. 
Curry being 8-21 doesn't bother me\n\nbarnes not showing up today and checking out when his team needed him most had to be frustrating for GSW fans.\n\nLove ghana Love, amazing at what hes been doing with his pay
Real talk, you fucks have made this sub insufferable the last two days. You all act like LeBron is soft because he doesn\'t like to get called a bitch, while simultaneously standing up for a recidivist dick swatter. Posting and upvoting all these people with there cute little tweets/soundbites about how he is soft. Check this guys stats the last 2 finals and tell me how he doesn\'t show up in big games. He arguably should have been the Finals MVP last year, and has heavily outplayed the MVP in both finals.\n\n\nDraymond Green reacted that way because he got disrespected. But he is too fucking stupid (or emotional) to realize that he is the only player on the court that can\'t fucking retaliate given his history throughout this playoff run. He had to stick up for himself as a "man" by swatting at a penis, again, and his suspension cost his team dearly. He deserves it. \n\nDraymond, you are nothing but a poor man\'s LeBron James. Even though Lebron has played in like 10 more NBA seasons than you, he is still, at this moment, better at every single facet of basketball than you are or will ever be. And he has the  ability to not play like an emotional moron every time he gets a little upset.\n\nIf not playing emotional and not liking to be called bitch makes one a bitch, well sign me up for bitch camp. 
Golden State are still gonna win this series i think but...\n\nKlay, don't ever trash talk and disrespect LeBron again. He's one of the best to have ever played, you're a nobody compared to him. Don't be a fool, hopefully you learned your lesson.
I\'m saying it\'s not easy to do what LeBron did against an NBA defense, Green or not. Yes, it\'s easier to do it when Green isn\'t playing. Why does it only "remarkable" for Lebron if he\'s going directly up against one of the top 2 defensive players in the league? \n\nFor 35 years people have played in finals games, mostly without having to face Green, and none of them put up 40/15/7. Lebron just did that, while being the best defensive player on the court for either team. It\'s an all time dominant performance regardless, because *no one had done it for 35 years.* He just took the defining Magic Johnson finals game, and added MVP defense onto it. The absence of one player doesn\'t negate how exceptional that is. It can\'t, because in the other 225 or so finals games since Magic\'s game 6\xe2\x80\x94plenty of them without a defender of Green\'s calibre\xe2\x80\x94 it had never been duplicated. There was a year the Nets made the finals. 
In my mind, Barnes will absolutely,  no doubt, get a max contract. Teams will definitely want a player that can disrupt the Warriors' offense like only he can 
Alongside Kevin "Cleveland Kryptonite" Love.
If there is a circlejerk forming around Barnes, I am all for it.
This is a quality analysis 
No matter how much you lost betting on the Warriors the last two games, nobody lost as much money as Harrison Barnes\n
Warriors might be able to sign him for ten bucks and thirty cents. 
I'll give you tree fiddy 
If Harrison Barnes shot Tupac he would still be alive
Harrison Barnes = Stormtrooper confirmed
TIL Harrison Barnes shot Tupac.
Yeah, but Cleveland hasn't played any SEC Defenses 
Ah yes, the Oregon Ducks argument. 
they got some quality losses early tho
SEC SPEEEEEEED
Isn't it obvious? They just don't have the strength of schedule like Alabama.
I'm from Ohio and this isn't even the right sport and I'm still mad
At least you're not from Michigan state. 
Fuck state. Harbough has come and thus their demise is assured.

Seeing that Craig Sager interview almost made me tear up
I think Lebron was choking up at the end too. What a great moment, so much emotion. 
Anyone have a video of it? I was at bdubs
Here's part of it: \nhttps://twitter.com/JimmyTraina/status/743652514608873472?s=09
How the hell did you go 30+ years without getting a finals game
I had tears in my eyes when I saw the tears rolling down his face as Lebron was joking with him.
If you want to cry more, [someone said they know someone w/ cancer and Sager is his inspiration. Sager talked to him via FaceTime right away.](https://twitter.com/LaurenBrill5/status/743644017745924100)

It certainly made Craig tear up. Towards the end you can see tears strolling down his face. Props to LeBron for giving credit to the best reporter in NBA history.

Thanks a lot Warriors. Now we've got Game 7 up against Game of Thrones.
and its the final two episodes of GoT... I have a feeling GoT will be a better watch if LeBron is still possessed.....\n\nDubs have lost their mojo/cool ala OKC... its exact same fucking thing. 
Yeah, because that didn't happen 3 days ago. Oh wait.
I feel like there's only 1 guaranteed and thats GOT. MITB is good on paper but they could easily fuck it up. game 7 is a toss up.
And Money In The Bank. \n\nSeth Rollins vs Roman Reigns will be awesome...but not this awesome.
They should just cancel money in the bank and do it next werk
Not even Styles/Cena, and that's saying something.
This might be the stiffest competition WWE has ever been against on a ppv day. 
Has to be. They never schedule against major NFL games and this is probably the biggest NBA game in 20 years.
Up against father's day...\n\nWho am I kidding, my father left

Oof. That's terrible for viewership on both sides.
I'm out here trying to get people to start watching Preacher and then they go and do this.

I feel like its the other way around. Steph is Ramsey and Lebron is Jon trying to take back his crown/Winterfell

Love had a concussion, that's still quite the injury 
Oh shit I forgot, I got caught up in the memeing and now I feel bad :(
I bet he's super fatigued right now. If this were the NFL he'd still be questionable for game 7

I dunno. He still has never been able to demonstrate consistent performance. That's always been his knock, that he's hot one day and literally worthless the next.\n\nThis series is just going to solidify that and leave that idea real fucking fresh in the minds of GMs. He'll probably get it, but I don't think it's a guarantee anymore.

MAX CONTRACT TIME
The game felt over at 6-0 in the first.
As a Warriors fan with other buddies, all who are die hard Dubs fans, we all felt this way. The crowd at quickenloans was so punped after LeBron scored to go up 6-0.
Game was sealed by the end of Q1
It felt like that for a while, at the end of the 3rd when the Cavs were throwing three's up, I expected a GS run. 
we just came out lookling like we didnt want to win this one. fucking disgraceful effort
ohh i gauran-fuckin-tee your boys wanted to win
I'm a cavs fan, but I think Golden State looked even worse at the end of the game. The look on their faces wouldn't lead me to think they will go into game 7 with any confidence at all. 
Game was over when Kevin Love got benched for foul trouble.
Ha, I told my SO that was probably good for the Cavs
Refs rigged the game and helped Cavs by calling that BS 3rd foul on Kevin love
Steve Kerr gonna suspend Draymond for Game 7 for drawing the foul on Love 
That's what I told my dad in the first half. Shumpert was trying his best in the first half to keep Golden State in it.
Seriously. Shumpert plays like such a dumbass 
I think when the trade happened the Cavs wanted Shumpert and the Knicks forced them to take J.R. with him. Weird how things worked out. 
Even last year... Honored Shump with a respectable contract and locked him up but JR we risked him walking. JRs so invaluable this year its incredible. 
i felt bad for love he had a nice block to open the game and got to the line a couple times and a few nice box outs for rebounds then he has to send his ass to the bench for 12 minutes
Yeah kev came out strong. I think he was about to have a good game
Don't forget his 3
LeBron brought Craig Sager to tears, what a moment.
No doubt if that's me courtside with that mouthpiece sitting there I go grab it. No shame.
... and put it in your mouth?
*shows grandchildren his sports memorabilia*\n\n'This is the mouthpiece from the 'Tantrum Game''
If it hit me I would have acted like I got shot. 
courtside flopping next level
I gotta win one for the land
We know, Varejao.
I'd probably keep it until Curry makes HOF. Sell that for a pretty penny.
Nah! gotta sell that while the saliva is still fresh!!!
If you put it in your mouth you gain his powers

Harrison "Max" Barnes. 16 mins, 0-8, 2 rebounds, 0 assists, 2 fouls and 0 pts. 
And Cavs got shit for the deal Tristan Thompson got, look who laughing now :>
Barnes is inconsistent as fuck he doesn't deserve 20m that's laughable. As the 3-4 option he gets wide open shots and still plays like shit...
Brah 2/22 in 2 games. \n\nThat's consistent
That's horrible
Consistently horrible
For those of you worried/hopeful that Curry gets suspended - He could have punched that fan in the face, pulled his pants down and tea bagged him, called the ref every homophobic slur known to man and I guarantee you the NBA does **not** suspend Curry in game 7.
I honestly think he deserves to be suspended, but I don't want the cavs to win that way. Rooting for the cavs I want to defeat GSW at full strength. 
He's definitely not even close to being suspended. However, that was atrocious. I'm not a Steph or Warriors hater at all (I hate their fans, I think the team is great) but intention or not, to loose his cool like that was inexcusable. There's a lot of uppity assholes that sit in those floor seats especially during the finals. If that hits one of them in the eye, the league might have been looking at a legal issue. For the record if that hit me I would've been totally cool with it. Would've kept the mouth guard too. Someone else might not be so cool about it.
I'm a Cavs fan and I'd hate it if Curry was suspended. I want a real Game 7.
Zero chance he gets suspended. 1. He didn't do anything to warrant it. 2. The next game is going to destroy any previous game in history
1. The league suspended Haslam for a playoff game for the doing the same damn thing. 
There is precedent for players getting suspended for throwing their mouthpiece 
> 1. He didn't do anything to warrant it\n\n[Halem got suspended for for throwing his mouth guard and he didn't even hit anybody.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjCLYqTp6F4) I'm not saying they'll suspend Steph (they won't) but it's definitely something that's been suspension worthy in the past. 
He whipped it at the ref though. The league never looks kindly on aggression towards refs. No league does, the NHL suspended a defenceman on the Calgary Flames 20 games this season for hitting a ref. For reference, Stephen Jackson only got 30 games for the Malice at the Palace and he punched the shit out of multiple fans.
to be fair, it looked like Haslem was aiming it at the ref.
He won't get suspended but in any other circumstance, throwing something at a fan like that could warrant suspension.
Yes the mouthpiece just launched itself at the fan.  Curry had nothing to do with it 
I wouldn\'t call it an "accident." It\'s not like the mouth guard slipped out of his hand. He threw it purposely. Not trying to hit a fan, but without care or regard to where it hit or landed.
No it's not.  \n
Idk that fan was taunting the shit out of Curry 
He threw it in a direction it could only hit fans. If I throw a rock aimlessly towards the ocean when I'm on the edge of a beach then I can't act like I didn't expect it to hit the water.
exactly. I know there's zero chance he gets suspended, but people need to stop acting like he's done nothing to warrant it.
Lebron would not let them suspend his baby boy.
He's got kids man
he's a father of 3, and a man
LeBron disowned one of his kids just so he could son Steph
In that scenario, Draymond is suspended as tribute.
But his donkey face can't compete with Steph Babyface curry in terms of selling NBA to a wider audience
no pun intended
Anderson Verajao has already flopped at that suggestion.
Says the fellow Cavs fan. Come on man, we subjected 29 other teams to that for 10ish years while we laughed uproariously. Let's not bitch about it when we have to put up with it for a series, infuriating as it may be. It's really just our own medicine coming back to us.
Draymond is allowed to punch the fans' dick and balls to be fair to him as well.
can't they suspend Harrison Barnes? letting this dude play is more egregious than letting OJ walk.
Daaaaamn! Harsh and topical! You know it's bad when K-Love shoots better than you.

Lmao i don't even get it but i laughed
I got you on the explanation: \nBlurry picture of a goat, \nwipes off dirty glasses to see better, \nturns out the GOAT (greatest of all time) is Lebron.\n
OWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW\n\nty honeybun
No, no, no. LeBron cleans his glasses and smiles cuz he can see goat now
It could have been great with the same goat pic and a Lelbron face on it
Quality postgame interview by LeBron there. 
Not knocking on LeBron personally but it's easy to stay classy/humble when you're winning.
LBJ is a billion dollar brand. Its easy to stay classy with all that money :D
Went and listened to it again for ya, here is what I got. "First of all, Lemme ask you a question, how in the hell you gone 30 plus years without getting a Finals game? That don\'t make no sense!" \n\nAll transcription errors can be blamed on Bombay Sapphire.

wheeew boy, dusty in here
He showed much class and refused to take the trash talk bait. I was saying all along golden state needs to stop talking shit in the press.  Doesn't anyone ever learn. You don't give great players extra motivation. Ever.
Man's a pro with media. He's had more experience there than playing in the NBA
Two NBA legends right there. Props to Lebron for that end of his speech.
Dude was looking pretty damn chill for just dropping an all-time performance. Dunno how people hate him sometimes.
That was also likely the final interview of Craig Sager's career.
He isn't doing game 7?
A post game interview with one of the all time greats after a classic finals performance is a great way to go out. Props to ESPN and TNT for making it happen, lovely gesture.
He knows how to talk to the media that's for sure. Idk what I would have said when they asked me about steph curry!
Why? He doesn\'t make many media blunders ever since the decision and the  "not one not two"  stuff. 
Something along the lines of Curry was the first ever unanimous MVP, and you're dominating him in the finals. How do you feel about that?
I agree with you. He didn't just smash a record. He put one on the outside of the records for three points. It's gonna be a looooooong time before some one comes close. 
He led a team to 73. And it was far from just a good 3 point shot. Ball handling, steals, drives, you name it. He has been a complete jaw dropping phenom. But yes, his 3 point and win record alone makes it a no brainer. He didn't just smash the record, he made previous records (his own) look like it belonged in high school. The circus level he played at all season is not that of a normal elite basketball MVP.
One thing is certain, though. Win or lose he will not be the finals MVP
Lebron 
[This is what I would've said.](https://youtu.be/UTCOQ-qQIPw?t=7s)
Y'all see Varejo hit the ground when Curry threw his mouthpiece? He didn't realize who's it was.
So salty 
Jesus it's just a game. Don't take it so seriously. All this salt is bad for your health 
The only cum being put on anyone's face was Lebrons on yours and all the other salty warriors fans 
With the way your acting, you might as well be a living sterotype of a warriors bandwagoner.
Y'all see varejao roll around in pain when Cavs player grabbed his hand to help him up?

My girlfriend literally just asked if it was the Georgia State Warriors. 
To be fair to her, Golden is not a State and is a stupid name for a team
Georgia State would never play this bad.
I think we can all agree that if RJ Hunter was on the Warriors, this series would be over.\n\nGo Panthers.
Break up with her 
How long has she been rooting for them?
We can only assume another lifelong fan
Longer than most warriors fans
I enjoyed reading this, thanks. 
Count it! 
Couple of points:\n\nWhat the fuck was Draymond doing yelling at the ref when the game was practically over? You know there's a game seven, just don't do anything dumb.\n\nEvery Warrior not named Steph or Klay should be embarrassed. No-one showed up tonight.\n\nLeBron is incredible.\n\nHarrison Barnes has to be trying to trash his FA value, there's no other explanation.
Ehh, after those last five minutes I would say Steph and Klay have plenty to embarassed of. Steph threw his mouth piece into the stands and hit a front row fan, and Thompson after boldly stating that this was a "man\'s game" went to the locker room early.
If I'm Steph I absolutely would have been angry too, it's not like he lined the fan up and threw it at him, he was angry over a bullshit foul in a game that meant something too him and he made a spur of the moment mistake. Then went directly to the fan and apologised. \n\nCan't really comment too much on Klay, he probably should have stayed out there. In saying that I don't particularly care that he left early.
To be honest, I'm surprised the refs gave him the tech. Not because it wasn't a good call - I've seen players get techs for less than that - but just because they actually had the balls to call it and eject the MVP. I get the feeling he probably said something to regret too which probably contributed.
I'd say Barbosa was pretty solid. He scored 14 points in 18 minutes with 4-6 fg shooting.
If James can pull off a game 7 win, in Oakland, after being down 3-1, bringing his down trodden home town it\'s first title in most fans life time.... I mean holy shit. I can\'t wait to watch that "30 for 30" 20 years from now.
Fuck
Don't blown yet young buck. Hold it in that'll make it extra special when it happens. 
Against a 73 win team. I'd say it'd be in the running for biggest comeback/upset ever. 
With the first ever unanimous MVP. After all "the decision", drama and the homecoming. I mean it is an amazing story if they lose, it is a damn real life fairy tale if they win.
Silence in the Roaracle
If lebron fulfills the prophecy on Sunday, you can bet your ass there's going to be a 5 part ESPN documentary
If he wins, I think he could walk the streets of Cleveland randomly shooting strangers in the chest for the rest of his life, and never get arrested or even questioned by a cop. He would Really be the king of this city.
When the king took his throne- or something GoT related given the fact that GoT takes place at the same time.
That\'s a good one. Or "King Me" works pretty good. 
'Sup Ayesha
I like "The once and future King" myself.
Plus, Winds of Winter will have finally come out in 20 years, making the title even more relevant.

So happy to see LeBron giving Craig Sager some love there at the end of the interview, a moment to be savored
I would expect someone of Lebron's stature to be totally unaware of something like that. One of the reasons I'm a Lebron fan is his overall appreciation for basketball and everything/everyone who goes into it.
It looked like Craig teared up a bit.
No shit I started to cry. Sager had a couple tears as well. He's one of a kind and a great man and in my opinion has brought more to reporting sports that anyone else. God Bless him

http://imgur.com/zccoJWM   I Swear this was not photoshop lol.. Its the Lebron Smile
I will never doubt your greatness again Lebron... Until next season when this happens all over again 
Lebron is too soft
Can everyone who said LeBron/Kyrie wouldn't sustain their scoring please stand up
Kyrie was considerably worse than 5 (still really good), so I'm fine with being in that camp.
Yeah there was no way he'd continue shooting 70% on ridiculous turnaround j's
I'll admit I soured a bit on kyrie
I'll admit it. I knew LeBron would LeBron but gotta give Kyrie props. This dude been balling and straight up abusing Curry
Well, they didnt. Kyrie shot 7/18 and had 23 points. Kyrie was unrealistically hot last game. LeBron though..\n\nThe scary thing for GS, is that LeBron didn't hit a bunch of circus shots in either game. Sure, he might not shoot 50% on threes again in game 7, but that still leaves him with what, a 35 point triple double? Nothing LeBron is doing is unrepeatable. He's LeBron James-ing. 3 days off, and then GS gets 45 minutes of 100% effort LeBron again.
I remember one GSW flair sayin he wasn't even watching the finals cause they were too easy compared to OKC
I need to go find all of the comments from Warrior fans saying that POR would beat us and that we don't belong in the finals lol
Can everyone who said this was a man's league please stand up?\n\nI'm looking at you Klay Thompson hahahahaha
walking off the court before the game is over after calling it a man's league seems silly
Agree to disagree. \n\nWalking off like that shows immaturity befitting a boy, not a man.
Klay has easily been the Warriors best player this playoffs. Without his game 6 performance vs the Thunder they aren't in the Finals.
He's getting outplayed by LeBron who he unwisely called out. Not the smartest move questioning the mental toughness of the best player in the world
All Steph is, and all he ever will be, is the best shooter in the world. He's got a pretty shit inside game, he has no defense worth mentioning (have you seen Kyrie make him just look fucking silly?) and his rebounding leaves much to be desired. Hell, Klay is a better all-around basketball player than Steph is; at least he plays high level defense as well as being a world-class shooter. LeBron is a pure all-around superstar.
I think you got your feelings hurt. 
Bruh he isn't even the best player on his team in both finals...
GSW might win, but Steph aint better than LBJ. He got the MVP cause GSW had the best season in the history of the NBA, not because hes better than everyone else individually.\n\nLBJ, KD, maybe even RWD are all > Steph imo.
Balling straight off the bench before the game is even over
ayyyyy
Him walking out before the whistle sealed his fate. 
I lol'd when he couldn't even watch the rest of the game. I think his feelings were hurt.
I guess he got his feelings hurt
I need some popcorn to go with all the salt in this thread
So much salt that even I could walk on water.
Important to note that although the Warriors are still favored on Sunday, they\'ve never been under this amount of pressure to win. If the Cavs lose it\'s going to be "oh well, what do you expect the W\'s won 73 games and LeBron really played his heart out". The Warriors have a lot more riding on game 7 and I really can\'t wait to see how they respond
> The Warriors have a lot more riding on game 7\n\nWhat? It's the deciding game for the NBA championship. Both teams have everything riding on it.
Nobody expected this series to go to 7... keep in mind that the Warriors are a 73-9 team with two of the best 3-point shooters in NBA history, one of which happens to be a back-to-back league MVP. They've broken record after record this season and were the heavy title favorites. The Cavs were down 1-3 and most NBA viewers expected them to lose in 5 or 6. It would be a great story if they won the series and the championship, but it wouldn't be exactly unexpected if they lost considering who they're up against.
I'm a Patriots fan for football. Last night I couldn't help but feel like if the Warriors lose game 7 they're going to be compared to the 07 Patriots by some.
idk I think game 7 of the WCS had enough pressure. They were even down 13pts at one point
This is way more pressure than that. They've come all this way. And to be fair, the Thunder gave that game away. The Cavs showed tonight they aren't going to give games away like that

What do we think about Marc Jackson sounding off on Klay leaving early? I think he's right. You can't preach manhood then proceed to walk away like a boy.
Dude I am sure he was told too\n\nEverybody was about to flip their shit\n\nNo problem with him and other walking away before they did something stupid\n\nJackson is the last that should be talking about manhood since he got someone fire because he felt threatened 
Wow the entire website got fired?!?
The entire team including Kerr kind of turn into children when things aren't going their way.\n\nIt seems embedded in their team culture.
based Dempsey and the great wall of Brooks
I thought it was interesting they shit him down. He was clearly going to elaborate then just stopped. It fuels all the "Golden State is the media\'s golden child" narrative. Any one have video of this?
I guess his feelings just got hurt.
Klay looks mentally defeated honestly. Talking shit and then pulling that. That's not the attitude of a winner
He's the only reason they beat OKC though. Maybe he's exhausted because he's been carrying this team and the MVP on his shoulders the entire playoffs. 
It\'s a man\'s game. As long as I\'m winning
This is so delicious I Can barely take it. I never thought I'd have felt so strongly negative against Klay but that comment rubbed me the wrong way, like he was spitting in a possible GOAT's face.\n\nAnd then Lebron gives him the Dad Dick to hell and back and Klay and steph act like children....\n\nIts so delicious I think imma get Diabetes
He stopped mid sentence like some one tapped him on the shoulder while shaking there head.
I interpreted it as him not wanting to clown too hard because he loves Klay - he just couldn't think of a way to back out of the statement.
Lol r/warriors was saying that Jackson is the number one warrior hater and de facto mayor of r/NBA after every warriors loss.
He may very well have beef with the organization, but I have no doubt he still loves the players.
He's exactly right though. had that been kobe or lebron or westbrook or, hheaven forbid, Nowitzki, he would have been roasted.
The second string RB for the Steelers got cut for that two years ago, a guy with a significant amount of carries too. 
I can never decide if it hurts worse that he got a ring for being a chucklefuck, or that Polamalu and Keisel ended their careers with a loss to the Ravens because we had no competent back up RB that knew the system after injuries.\n\nFuck Blount.
LaGarrette Blount
LeGarrette Blount is a weird example all around. Does pretty decently for the Pats, signs a deal with the Steelers for 2 years, then almost immediately gets suspended for getting high with their #1 RB LeVeon Bell. Comes back and doesn't do much, walks off early in a game against the Titans, gets released, then goes back to the Pats and just goes off.\n\nPlus he got suspended in college for punching a Boise State player after they beat his Oregon team.
Yeah I remember watching that punch live lol. Blount clocked his ass
Belichick cut a RB who score like 30 Fantasy points (so a lot of yards and TDs, forget exact numbers) for being late to a team meeting.\n\nNBA is too soft on calling out unprofessionalism. Remember Pistons walk-off against the Bulls? Klay should be called the fuck out just like Isiah was.
I am not saying Klay gets cut, but the media should call him the fuck out on it. You don't say that LeBron's feelings are hurt then walk off like he did. That's being a bitch 101 and he should get ripped.
I have plenty of doubt that Curry will reach that top 10 all-time level. At this point, he's a tier above Nash and T-Mac, but still several rungs below Kobe and Byrd.
Why is no one making a big deal about Klay leaving early? I seem to remember a guard from a reigning champ leaving a game early, and it being a HUGE deal.
I think maybe he got his feelings hurt.
i wonder if his feelings got hurt
Biggest sore loser in the league. Remember the hate LeBron got at the end of his first CLE stint, just for not shaking hands? Klay can't even stick with his team til the game ends, smh
Fuck that guy, Klay could get a pass for that kind of shit, but he did it all throughout the season. He gave the Bucks crap for beating the Warriors, he gave the Blazers craps for beating the Warriors, I'm sure there's one or two other examples out there. Complete sore loser, give your opponent credit, they beat you in a game of basketball in 48 minutes. Now all of a sudden his team is getting the opposite end of the media, and he's going to act like a child about it, especially making the bitter comments that he's made previously in the series.
If there's time on the clock the game isn't over. Any good coach will teach you that in any peewee level sport. 
Ah more reasons to hate the Warriors.
Really though, I have no horse in this race and generally rooted for the Warriors all season because they were fun to watch. This post season though has made me despise them. Between their family members coming out and talking shit, draymond s antics against the thunder, and now curry and klay acting like spoiled little kids I'm having a real hard time rooting for them. Maybe it's just the additional media coverage on them, maybe it's just they expected the title to be gifted to them after being the Golden child all season, or maybe they just forgot what it's like to lose, but all of them need to grow up and act like adults. 
Isiah Thomas?
Thought it was pretty classless TBH
Especially given his recent comments about it being a man's game lol
Don't worry. His daddy will do the talking for him.

CLG is a league of legends team in the NALCS. In the past, they have look promising at the beginning at the split (season) and collapsed near the end. Combined with other throws, the false hope meme was born.
This is the hardest deja vu I've ever had. I swear to god I read this exact comment chain in game 4's thread.
CLG (Counter Logic Gaming) is a professional League of Legends Team.  The picture was from a wheel jokingly created by their former coach MonteCristo.  [Here's the video about the wheel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdkffhjcKj0).  Context starts at about a minute in.

In a turn of events, Curry gets suspended Game 7 and all hope is lost for the Warriors\xe2\x80\xa6until Barnes has the redemption game of his life leading Golden State to the win. He gets the Finals MVP Award and that max contract. 
Proceeds to average 10/2/2 for the rest of his career 
They'd have to remake Believeland to put that in there.

Wouldn't even be mad that'd be amazing and hilarious

I was alive when Harrison Barnes dropped 60 over LeBron 
If I learned anything from watching the 30 for 30 on Cleveland, there's a very good chance this will actually happen
I'd be mad 
yeah cause one of you is an actual Cavs fan
i gotchu bruh
Forever. Least clutch warrior ever. 
He has hit a few very clutch shots in the past. He's just going through a drought at the worst moment...
Stat from NBA.com:\n>Harrison Barnes is the only NBA player to never make a shot in his entire life
I can't believe the title is coming down to Harrison Barnes missing shots with literally nobody guarding him
So yes, you need Kevin Durant
my condolences for the team who maxes him
Lakers it is!
2 for 22 the last two games, just terrible. 
Dude seriously is playing more shit then Kevin  Love
At least he's playing
16. With 0-13 shooting 
But Barnes hurts his team when hes on the floor. At least Love fouls himself out of playing 
Love at least hit 1 shot and drew some fouls.  I'm going to miss picking on him for being the worst player.  Seriously though, 0-8 on mostly wide open shots.  
Shumpert has definitely been worse these finals but Love has definitely been the worst in terms of expectations these finals
BREAKING: Game 7 to be decided by a game of HORSE between Barnes and Love.
By the time that game was over you'd have to call the winners the 2017 champs
We all owe an apology to /u/Rabsho
What was his prophecy?
Fuck that, I've been on board with /u/Rabsho. Harrison Barnes is a pile of hot dogshit.  When he has a good game it is the exception not the rule. Dude might have the worst handle of any SF, SG, or PG in the league.
mods please unban him. He was simply a misunderstood prophet.
Why did they ban him?
For throwing his mouthpiece
I think he should actually be made a mod for his prophecy.

And I'll do it for half of a max contract!
I'll do it for the minimum.
AMA Request:  The Cavs fan who got hit with a mouthpiece. 
Forbes, not Gilbert
A real Cavs fan would've flopped to try and get Curry suspended for Game 7.
Just today I saw someone selling a mouthpiece Curry threw to the floor during a game for $5000. \n\nThis one must be worth even more because it's the Finals and Curry fouled out etc. So yeah, I bet he's making fucking bank if he picked it up and kept it.
[Sell it for 5k](http://www.sbnation.com/lookit/2016/6/15/11948830/you-can-now-own-stephen-currys-mouthguard).\n\nThen again, this is a special Finals mouthguard that commemorates Steph's first ejection. So 20k.

How much did you sell it for?\n\n"Reserve not met"\n\n
 "Sir, we asked how it was to get hit by Steph\'s mouthpiece, not how Ayesha feels every time she sees LeBron block another of Steph\'s shots."
Looks like it's a perfect set-up for Love to drop 65 in Game 7 and get finals MVP
I said this today to a co-worker. If there's a game 7, Love will have a good game. Usually happens when people stop expecting the world from you. 
he is going to need too. Cavs will need something else to get this last win.
I think Steph will play well next game. Plus he probably won't foul out on his own floor.

Welp, all down hill from here
Man I miss that team.
californian lol, i\'m born and raised la, and fuck golden state. dodger fan in me will never appreciate a bay area team.
Why would being from California obligate you to hate Lebron?
no
speak for yourself 
Its a bad one fam
hell no we don't
So you are a fan of 4 NBA, 5 MLB, and 4 NFL teams?
usc and ucla are both california. let's root for both of them at the same time too.
And while we're at it, Mets and Yankees fans can start rooting for each other's teams\n\n^^^^when ^^^^hell ^^^^freezes ^^^^over
This makes me so freaking mad.
Oakland
fuck no, i'd rather wear a celtics IT jersey before i put on anything warriors\n\nanyway, the lebron hate comes from all those years of having to put up with the debate of kobe vs lebron. now that kobe's retired, i can finally let that rest
The flair in you should say kobe is the one true god
I want to compare both to the Hype Sparrow and King Tommen Slayer of Hype but it would be kinda dick to both.\n\nKobe is Barristan the Bold. LeBron is Ser Arthur Dayne.
Why be a king, when you can be a God.

yeah this is a good time to call it a night. 
Seriously it's amazing...I didn't even realize it was looping for a while.
Bruh.... for all the people who said LeBron "only" dropped 40+ when Draymond was suspended.\n\n* **Game #5:** 41 points, 16 rebounds, 7 assists, 3 steals, 3 blocks, Game #6:** 41 points, 8 rebounds, 11 assists, 4 steals, 3 blocks, WHAT THE FUCK MAN.... GREATNESS. Sunday night will be legendary.
They also dropped love that's why they're winning
Imagine if he has an even better performance in game 7... the case could be made.... that he's better than... Mike?
If you told LeBron it was an elimination game, i don't think even Mike could stop him.
**Don't hate, appreciate.**\n\nThis is a once in a lifetime player y'all. Recognize greatness
Lebron scored 18 points, 20/25 and assisted or scored on 28/30 points at one point.
He's on another level right now. 
Lol remember when everyone kept saying Cavs would lose in 4 or 5 max\n\nEvery single one of r/NBA's subscribers should send LeBron a personal apology.
How about games three and five? That was embarrassing for you bandwagon warriors fans huh
To be fair, after the abysmal Games 1 + 2, you can't blame em.
I apologise (I said Cavs in 6 tho)
All you western teams. Imagine dealing with fucking Lebron James for OVER TEN YEARS. The last team that could beat him in the east was the fucking 2010 CELTICS.\n\nGreat team. Miss you paul pierce.
LOL "objectivity"
keep that salt flowing :)
I mean we all had to deal with him in the finals cuz he made it every year
I always have a soft spot for that team after they knocked the lakers out
Man, I'm so proud of the Magic team that made the finals. Never really thought how much LeBron has dominated the east.
I feel vidicated by this win. Yes, a fucking alien rapes and pillages our conference year after year. To put into terms you Western Conference teams can understand, it's like if Shaq maximized his potential and stayed in one conference for his entire career. 
Or kobe x2
> a fucking alien rapes and pillages our conference \n\nSam Cassell has been retired for a while now dude.
Rajon rondo carries the torch
The last 6 years of LeBron has made me able to understand Bills, Dolphins, and Jets fans a little better. 
Me fuckin' too.\n
Highest game score for a player EVER in the finals, gonna be a legacy defining performance for LeBron if the Cavs pull this off in 7
I've never been a big Lebron fan, but damn, even if they lose he deserves the Finals MVP. Just passed Magic on the all time list for mine.
didn't magic go 42/15/7 in an elimination game 6, where he replaced an injured Kareem?  
as a rookie, starting at center.
Uphill, both ways.
if we win game 7 its the most fairy tale shit I've ever heard of
You need something like that to break your "curse". Hell look at what the Redsoxs did in 2004. 
I was about to say. Redsox won the championship the same way. Came back from down 3-1. It does happen!
Actually was 3-0 which no baseball team has ever done. 
That wasn't the WS, that was the ALCS
Once upon a Lebron...
Once Lebron a time...
I can only hope you are as baked as I am, you just blew my mind
No way am I preparing myself for that disappointment. Cavs gonna get blown out as far as im concerned.
If Cavs win game 7, I think every Finals loss for LeBron should be forgotten. 
Failures
Just give him 2 rings
I'd honestly be fine if he retired right after. The prophecy would've been fulfilled.
But what if he then tried out with the Indians?
Major League 4 confirmed.
He could switch to playing baseball I suppose.
He'll switch to football and lead the Browns to a championship.
The king who was promised
Shouts out to everyone who told me LeBron could only do that with Draymond in the game, despite him scoring 40+ on Draymond in the Finals four times.
Lol k
It hurts when you pee cuz you jerk off to Curry too much. 
And last year the Warriors beat a full strength cavs team? Seems like the same type of situation but flipped.
NO EXCUSES.
Shout out to all the people talking shit about Lebron on /nba when they were 3-1 but now pull the "i knew all along" bullshit and flip like a bitch to the other side when the tides change. Youre doing an excellent job at it
I been hating the Warriors all year, go fuck around on someone else bitch
Real talk i just checked ur post history and you have been hating. My bad homie i thought you were like the majority of /nba but you keeping it real\xe2\x9c\x8a
Dude forreal. On the Game #5 post it was downvoted but soooo many people were saying that. It's like, did they not see the 2015 NBA Finals? LeBron is fucking brilliant. Any moron who doesn't see it by this point REGARDLESS of what happens in Game #7 will never accept it. 
Lebron is an all time great man, but game 7 is going to define a major piece of his legacy. This is actually the most important game in his career lol. 
So true Iguodala got Lebrons finals MVP last year because he limited James and thus stopped what had been the most amazing single player performance in the finals.  Win or Lose Lebron is the MVP of this finals.  Be better if he wins though so Cleveland can get a championship and be the only team to win after being down 3-1 while James takes the MVP.  It would close the gap to a manageable distance for Lebron to overtake MJ.
Sunday will be the biggest game of Lebrons Career.  Jordan is still my all time greatest, but Lebron stands alone in the conversation with him.  
Have they not watched his career? He was also putting up monster numbers against Kawhi, and he's dubbed a Lebron stopper.
We\n\nAre\n\nAll\n\nWitnesses
He is a fucking lion
He actually qualifies for being built different 
The King in the North 
He is a basketball god, jesus christ he is incredible
You could even say he's good at basketball.
Some may even say he's great.
Don't be ridiculous
sometimes you just gotta stand up and destroy all the jackals 
I loved the part where they said hyenas and immediately cut to Draymond Green 
And the donkeys.
Lebron fucking eats
This guy FUCKS.
Lebron eating fucks
From the 5 minute mark of the 3rd quarter to the 2:26 minute mark of the 4th quarter [14 minutes 34 seconds], Lebron James scored or assisted on every single Cavs point [With the Exception of the Kyrie Irving Techincal Free Throw]. His stats during that time 25 pts 4 assists 3 rebounds 1 block. Wow.
That's a fucking great game's worth of stats in 14 minutes. \n\nLeBron is my favorite player man.
And people got angry with him not agreeing that Curry was the undisputed MVP
He's leading BOTH teams in Points, Rebounds, Assists, Blocks, and Steals. \n\nIf there was any doubt who the best player in the world was, there isn't now. It's Lebron James. \n\nEDIT: He's probably leading both team in Minutes too which is even more astounding. 
Not just now, but serious consideration for all time. I have not seen a better or greater player in my lifetime - and I'm not a 12 year old like a third of this sub
This is the game that convinced me he's the best player of all time. 
That's not unreasonable. Have you heard of a guy named Michael Jordan? 
Was there any?
I mean usually winning back-to-back MVPs fuels a lot of speculation about being the best in the league...
All the sports shows spent this season talking about curry being best I n the world. Lebron talked about the mvp award going to curry with a chip on his shoulder. These finals show lebron is just going ham.
this is some hakeem vs david robinson shit, lebron is comin for dat ass
There should have never been a doubt. Not to mention his defense, which has been absolutely incredible.
Averaging 31 ppg, 11.3 rpg, 8.5 apg this series. Unquestionably the best player in the league. 
Again.  Last finals he was the first player to ever do that...
Your are correct.  He was the first player to lead in P/R/A last year.\n\nNow he might be first to lead in P/R/A/B/S.
Have you seen the stats he is averaging between this and last years finals? Dude is an absolute monster
The greatest ever. \n\nReally.
His finals appearance is making a case for greatest ever yes, but Lebron still has more to do to pass MJ for GOAT.\n\nLebron is certainly playing like a GOAT rn but recency bias is huge in this thread rn.
No, you're wrong. No one has ever had a 10 year stretch like this. Ever. 
There's no need to ignore either of those things - but you're ignoring his game 6 and 7 performances in 2013.\n\nHe's not 1-5, end of story. \n\nHe's also had the best 2 year finals performance, ever. \n\nChampionships are a team metric. \n\nThere's literally nothing more he could have done, outside of 2011, ever. \n\nBy a slew of metrics, he's the best elimination game performer in NBA history. After 13 years and in his 6th consecutive Finals appeareance, he puts up the #1 and #3 game scores in Finals history, while facing elimination against the best record team in NBA history.\n\nIf you want to shortsell him, that's your prerogative, but you're wrong, and also missing out on appreciating something that's never been done before, not my Michael or Magic or anyone else. \n\n
Loosing in the finals is better than loosing in earlier playoff rounds.
I've been around a long time. \n\nI saw the 96 Bulls in person. \n\nLeBron is the best I've ever seen. 
It's just the all around impact he has.
It is. There's been nothing like it, ever. 
I think the point is that even if Lebron is better than Jordan was, he hasn\'t proven that confidently enough to overshadow Jordan\'s greater career accomplishments (and I don\'t just mean rings). \n\nBut he\'s definitely on pace, if he maintains anywhere near this level of play through the coming years. Plus, if they do take game 7, beating the "best team ever" is a HUGE feather in his cap as far as legacy is concerned.
One of the best individual Finals performances ever imo 
I mean last year he almost averaged a 30 pt triple double his team was just maimed 
efficiency is much better this year
I can't even blame him for the bad efficiency last year. When you're scoring option 1,2, and 3 for a team you're going to have to take some shitty shots. 
There's no question, putting up those numbers is incredible regardless of efficiency. \n\nBut putting up those same numbers efficiently, while still leaving plenty of offensive touches for teammates that are actually performing this time around (and then making a greater defensive impact with the added stamina of taking plays off on offense) is even MORE impressive.
Defense too
Flashbacks for Detroit fans.
:( \n\nDude is fucking great
Die. 
This one was a *lot* more fun for me to watch.
I was driving on 75 in downtown Detroit during the game, listening to it on the radio. Flashbacks so intense I almost drove into a wall. Flight of the Conchords were great tonight though so I can't complain. \n\n\n
Not even mad
I've just come to accept that we're LeBron's bitch.
We are all Lebron's bitch on this blessed day
Is it ok that Im rooting for the Cavs even though it's Cleveland and LeBron is an OSU fan? I'm looking for a release from my self hatred. 
I've been rooting for him for years now, not even all of that can force my hatred for Ohio to overcome how great it is to watch this man play.
We all are 
We are all LeBron's children.

No one is acting like that,he grabbed LeBrons hand clearly on foul 6 and then goes after the ref, don't try to spin that
yeah #6 was ticky-tack but probably legit. the kyrie foul was garbage tho.
That is completely true
I'll give you the 5th, but he got Lebron on the arm how is that not a foul? Or you just think it shouldn't be called because he has 5 already?
He never said they weren't bullshit calls. Because they were. That's the game, Cavs have had shit calls, so have the Dubs. Fact is if the Warriors hadn't laid a goose egg in the first then we very well might be crowning them right now. Calls go both ways, no point in complaining about it. 
It's fine cause it's a man's game

best reply "curry stop tweeting from your girls phone"
Someone please upload the Lebron highlights! As a Bulls fan I despised Lebron for years but wow... he made the Finals his showcase, MJ style. It was a privilege to watch that game. Just completely took over in the 4th - it was like he looked at his teammates and said "Alright fellas, I got this. Let me take over and follow me to the promise land". He was involved on every play on both ends of the floor, creating chances for himself & his teammates while also playing stellar D. What a display of physicality, accuracy and perennial basketball IQ. I can\'t begin to think how people hate this man - we are witnessing greatness, people! Enjoy it while we lasts. I felt like a kid in a candy store watching this game, it might be one of my favourite games ever & I said that after watching him erupt with Kyrie in Game 5! Definitely my favourite Lebron performance ever. I can\'t wait for Game 7, I think its going to be a special one. 
Reporters: What did LeBron say?\n\nCurry: Nothing\n\nLeBron: I said he\'s "nothing".
Steph Curry throws mouthguard at fans while being ejected. Klay walks off the court early. Can't wait to watch ESPN tomorrow.
Stephen a will be \xf0\x9f\x94\xa5
I hope they get into it. \n\nthis series took a huge swing when Dray swung, but the bigger story should be LeBron saving his best for the highest stage. I wish I could be mad, but the Warriors fell into a canyon and spent most of the game trying to get back in. \n\nHere's to Game 7. Both teams have had their moments and now we get to see who has what it takes. 
As a relatively neutral fan I just want the game to be close.
Both teams are 2-1 at home this series and both Steph and Lebron have had great games on the road. I have no idea what to expect, but I hope there's a legit crunch time. These double digit victories have been pretty brutal. 
Don't understand Warriors fans saying this was rigged. We got a couple tough ones, but were mostly just outplayed by LeBron. The worst calls for us were the ones against Kevin Love. We need that guy in the game, can't have him getting in early foul trouble.
Because Steph's defense is just so great
Funny.. I was saying the worst calls in the game were against Kevin Love... Huh thats interesting.. I guess we'll see his Game 7 performance
When was the last time a star player got his 6th foul during an NBA game, let alone in the finals?
Wasn't that Kevin Durant in that crazy win that the dubs had over the thunder during regular season?
I always think people that complain about calls are new to the game. The home team always looks like they're getting more calls but usually they're always the aggressor.\n\nThere was a stretch there where the Warriors looked like trash and we're lucky that curry and klay were just being themselves
Especially the calls on Curry. Yes they were bad, but you can't put yourself in that position. He played dumb and got hammered for it.
It was funny seeing him react so strongly and then on slowmo you could easily see it was a foul (apart from that steal on kyrie which maybe had a foul before the  steal)
That first Q submarined Golden State. Everyone was scared and Cleveland rightfully put the pressure on Steph to play defense since he was going to be working them on the other end. \n\nThey got rattled and the rest of the game was just playing catch up. Barnes might not be the same after this series, win or lose. 2-20 in the last two games. 
Steph deserved the MVP for the regular season, but LeBron deserves the Finals MVP, no matter who wins game 7.
This is a 5 game series without all of the shit he pulled off. I think Lebron has earned Finals MVP, unless Klay goes the fuck off and wins it for the Dubs.
Should've won it last finals also.
Dude, Lebron deserved Finals MVPs for putting the team on his back last year when Kevin and Kyrie were out. It'd mean a lot more if the award didn't automatically go to a member of the winning team.
1. LeBron 2. Kyrie 3. Klay 
I don't know. I mean I agree with you, he's obviously the best player here, but Klay's holding the Warrios afloat right now
he was garbage the first 3 ganes
Like who on the Warriors could you even give it to? Livingston?  I'd rather drink bleach than live in a world where Shaun fucking Livingston got a Finals MVP over the performance Lebron has put on.
Steph has played well these last 2 games, and Klay has probably been the mvl of the playoffs for the warriors so far; however, they aren't even close to Lebron's level right now. I know they probably won't give it to him but he definitely deserves it, just like last year.
Curry is averaging like 24 ppg on 43% shooting.\n\nCompared to LeBron's stats it should still go to LeBron, but they could justify giving it to Curry (which I would disagree with).
Klay Thompson has been a 3rd Quarter god this entire playoffs. Even when the Warriors lose, he's the only reason they ever have a sniff at a comeback. Thompson has been GOAT while Curry has been lackluster.
Klay is the clear answer here. He' the only dude bringing it somewhat consistently, but can't carry the whole team on his back.
Klay?
It'll probably go to Curry I guess?\n\nI can't believe I'm saying this two years in a row, but Lebron deserves the FMVP no matter who wins.  Two fucking years in a row.  What the fuck.
35.8/13.3/8.8. I'm sorry that's just like a 2k line. I'm not pissed Iggy got it, he was great, and definitely my second choice. But he won it because he way outperformed expectations. Nobody saw him coming. Without that, LeBron would have had it.
**2014-15 Finals**\n\nIguodala: 16.3pts 5.8reb 4.0ast 0.3blk 1.3stl\n\nLeBron: 35.8pts 13.3reb 8.8ast 0.5blk 1.3stl\n\nCome on man. \n
I completely agree with you; however, I can kinda accept Iggy with the FMVP.  This year is completely different, there is only one FMVP, and that is Lebron James.
Klay. He's been their best player this playoffs. Lebron no doubt deserves it tho.
Jerry West already won a finals MVP without his team winning in 1969.
Yeah, Klay was my second choice.  I'm really not sure because Curry has scored decently well in the last two games.
Last 3, he had 38 in game 4. Game 5 he was alright but worse than average.
After tonight's game? Livingston should get the co-MVP with Barnes for helping the Cavs win the series.
But Livingston pretty much single handedly won game 1 lol
Ouch
Don't worry, we can include Kevin love in that co MVPs
No matter who you wanted to win we all won tonight because Craig Sager gets to work another Finals Game.
Stephen A Smith *blank face emoji*
He won't be on for game 7.
If that's the case then how unfortunate. They should let him.
I read he was going to be playing golf for father's day

2007 Detroit Game 5. Almost a decade later, didn't know if Lebron would bring out another performance like that in a do or die game. We are all witnesses.
To be fair if cavs lost that game 5 against the pistons they wouldn't have been eliminated because there was still a game 6 to be played. These warriors game 5 and 6 was actually a do or die game for him. 
And dont get it twisted he did it two times in a row(Game 5,6)
And game five. 
As is game 7
Harrison Barnes is totally worth the max contract said no one ever.
Dude like half of the warriors fans said he was worth it after game 4
Said everyone a couple months ago. *Now* no one ever
I don't get how anybody could have bought into his skill. He was sucking all season long, and he is just terribly inconsistent at getting 3s, yet keeps shooting that like that one kid in high school who HAS to go for the long shot and always misses.\n\nHe can't even hit jumpers like Livingston can, and he scored less points with more minutes compared to Ezeli.  Watching those shots in the first quarter were so cringe; I have no idea what Kerr was thinking passing the ball to Barnes for the shot just for him to miss every fucking time.\n\nI just want the Lakers to take him. You know, because he's obviously too good for the Dubs\n\n

Loving the Lebron love for Sager 
Kerr saying that curry\'s fouls were "inappropriate for the league MVP" is annoying me more than it should. He doesn\'t deserve free passes because he\'s the mvp
But he\'s saying "Curry is the MVP so he shouldn\'t be called for fouls", which is asinine and just makes me lose respect for him honestly. 
During he post game presser. He was pretty noticeably pissed about them and said a few times that the refs were wrong/shouldn't call those types of fouls on the league mvp. \n\nI think some of them were weak calls, but it just really annoys me that he keeps bringing up the MVP thing. 
That being said, Curry played absoltutely stupidly. Going for balls he had no business going for, gamblig on plays, pressuring in absolutely weird situations. Mark Jackson likes to say you have to trust a guy to play with foul trouble, Curry did not play like somebody you can trust.
I hate even more that the league is going to fine Kerr and anyone else's for criticizing the refs and alleging unfair treatment but will then let bad ref call key games and treat players unfairly. You can't knowingly do some shit and then fine people for accusing you of doing it.\n\nHonestly I feel like people's faith in the integrity of league is really low this postseason because of stuff like this.
Warriors wouldn't be in the Finals if it weren't for the refs
Exactly. You're the MVP, you should be held to a higher standard. 
Is that what he meant? Or did he just mean the MVP shouldn't be playing in a way that gets him those fouls
Kerr's inability to develop Curry's D is inappropriate for the league MVP. 
Its more annoying that this is already a thing.we all know superstar calls exist.Kerr is right on something that shouldnt exist.You see it in soccer too.You tackle messi or ronaldo and you're an axe that doesnt deserve to play the game.Seriously when was the last time you've seen a superstar foul out.A point guard at that..goin on on a lil rant as knick fan melo is the only superstar player that never had any favors.After that suckerpunch in denver his image for the refs was ruined
any any ecuadorian warriors fans out there? a rather shit night for you guys 
Warriors lost to Cavs.\n\nEcuador was eliminated from Copa America by USA.
Fuck yeah I was watching both games at B-dubs.\n\nWhat a time to be alive!\n\nMaybe this will make up for the shit Crew season so far.
USA probably gonna get steamrolled by Argentina, but who cares.  USA playing the best team and the best player in the world on home soil... and there's always a chance.  Awesome.
I blame the new kit

The league made the Cavs shoot 52% and Warriors 40%.
Let's not pretend some of those calls were soft as FUCK. Just like the call on K.Love for his 3rd. Still, terrible fucking Refs on the biggest stage is absolutely unacceptable. Soccer/Football refs miss calls because they have no video replay, what in God's name is the NBAs excuse? 
But the thing is we're 6 games in to the referees sucking in the Finals.  This is really the first game to be fair rather than favor the\nWarriors heavily outright.

Lebron is a man. The Warriors are children. 
You got downvoted but I don't see Cavs players throwing temper tantrums on the court throwing their mouth pieces.
So what do you call the game 4 press conference?
No idea.  What do you call it?
Their coach literally called lebron a flopper in the postgame presser and said he's ok with curry throwing his mouthpiece.\n\nThey are soft, and they are whiners. \n\nLeBron is laying GOAT pipe on them.

Are you ready?
i cant believe it is going to game 7. I cant believe kryie is 1 game away from a ring. I cant believe the city of Cleveland is 1 game away from a championship. After being down 3-1......I just cant believe it...\n\n
Lmfao he can't even average 40 ppg in the finals. What a scrub.
Honestly I feel like he drops a 50-20-10 game in game 7
I would cum.
30.2 but yeah still crazy impressive.
Never, ever piss off Lebron and make him angry. Warriors had to talk shit and call him a bitch. They out this on themselves. 
Even if they lose, he has to be MVP
Yeah no one on the Golden State team is playing well enough in this series consistently to justify one of them winning the award.
We all were saying this last year.\n\nbut this year he has been as prolific AND efficient.\n\nIt is insane.
Should have had it last year to.
How'd you get 37.5?
Easy, you take the point total from the wins, subtract 1.5 and divide by three.  =37.5ppg
Yeah, props to LeBron but it's 30 right now.

I'm feeling a little uneasy right now...\n\n- Curry fouled out; lost his composure\n\n- Iggy doesn't look healthy\n\n- Bogut done for the series after Game 5\n\n- Harrison Barnes ain't making wide open shots\n\nSo many things going wrong!

Suh dude
yess
It's hard not to say the Warriors are choking. They look like they are choking. They look beaten. They'll string together a spurt but it's almost entirely led by Curry or Thompson being as good as they are. But everything else about their performance just looks shook. Yes. Losing Bogut was a huge blow. Yes, Iguodala is clearly hurt and the Cavs are exploiting that. For all we know Curry *is* still less than 100% or whatever. But Barnes? Livingston? Green? Even Curry looks to be working harder to get his normal or less results while both he and Klay keep falling into somewhat predictable patterns. But the bottomline, for whatever reasons or excuses, they're simply not competing at a level high enough to win an NBA championship and they basically haven't been for about 6 out of the last 8 quarters they've played. \n\nThe Cavs, meanwhile, have complete confidence and certainty that they can win. They know exactly what they are doing, they're hustling, they're outrunning and out-jumping their opponent. They're trying to *win* \n\nThe entire season, the Warriors looked unbeatable, their style of play was too mobile, too versatile, too unpredictable. It knocked teams off rhythm and left some of the best players in the league stunned. But the Cavs look like they're just quite simply figured it out and the Warriors are going to have to really come up with some answers at this point to validate their season.\n\nUnbelievable turnaround. \n
Let's be honest. Golden State hasn't played well consistently since the Portland Series.  Remember they were down 3-1 to OKC.  The role players won games 1 and 2 for them in this series as Steph and Klay were not very good. Now the role players have returned to earth and Harrison Barnes is just ridiculously bad.\n\n
OMG, Kerr totally bitching out the refs hardcore.  Literally said LeBron flopping and refs were garbage.  Said the MVP deserves more foul calls.\n\nThat's gonna cost him like $500,000 at least
As good owners should!
Between Ayesha saying the game was rigged, curry's mouth guard throwing and Kerr losing it on the refs, I hope the refs stick it to the warriors in game 7. Long live Lebron!
These Warriors are proving to be a bunch of classless dudes.\n\nTHey "won too early". Dont they know how fucking horrible it looks for the defending champs to be acting like children?\n\nA group that has never experienced losing together, losing their collective minds.
Mvp deserves more foul calls hahahahahhahaja 
Can we agree that if the Cavs win game 7, Draymond\'s groin hit will forever be called as "The Swipe"?
You're right, and I'm amazed people are downvoting you. Klay talking about mans game and then walking out before the game is over, Curry throwing his mouthpiece, Kerr talking about Lebron's flops and Curry being okay to the media, and that's just from this game. Draymond and Bogut being dirty players, all the illegal screens they do, the fact that they hold and play physical every game but then whine when a team does it back to them and beats them at it. They're young and stacked, so they're arrogant and think they should always be winning. And when they don't, they get pissy and throw tantrums.
LeBron just showed that Draymond's suspension didn't matter a whole lot.
Eh, I'm not going to disagree with the idea that if you only need to win 1 game out of 3, you fucking ought to and not bitch about the NBA. But tbf to the other side, Game 5 was pretty close until the third quarter and when they lost Bogut. \n\nDraymond's there, maybe Bogut doesn't get injured. Cavs might still even win, but a different turn of events. Same with if Draymond got suspended in the OKC series instead. Maybe it all works out evenly in the end but I think you can't just say that without context.\n\nEither way, Harrison Barnes should definitely keep forcing up shots.
I would refer to it as the stepover
30 for 30: The Swipe
What if I told you.... 
...A man just could not stop hitting other men's dick and balls?
He could have. Just didn't want to.\n\n30 for 30: The Donkey\n\nWhat if I told you...\n\nAn insatiable lust for dick and balls cost his team the championship.

Hey /u/bootum , Barnes wanted another video
Kerr's getting fined. 
Craig Sager looked ready to burst into tears when Lebron thanked him. Now I want to cry. I was as mad as anyone back in '08 but right now I think I would sacrifice a goat / small child to an altar of Lebron. 
You could tell Craig had no idea what was coming, and then LeBron said just about the nicest thing anyone could've said in such a jovial way too. And Craig almost looked like a kid at the end there.
GET ME A CLIP OF THE FALLING CAMERAMAN!
I've never wanted a player whom I don't like to win a game so bad. C'mon bron, get game 7 for the land.
Crappy foul calls or not Steve Kerr should not be bringing up Curry being MVP.\n You can't on one hand complain about inconsistent officiating then imply that the MVP of the league should be getting special consideration regarding fouls being called. (This is in reference to post game interview quotes. )
Dude what if Lebron drops 50 to win a title for Cleveland in Game 7 against the best regular season team ever?
I would bet obscene amounts of money that Lebron does not score below 10 points 
Then we will be the best team. Ever. 
why anyone would fuck with lebron is beyond me
So are we gonna talk about how Klay Thompson went to the locker room before the game was over? The Cavs broke them emotionally 
There were bad calls both ways. The Warriors have gotten the benefit of the doubt for all of the playoffs. Bad excuse.
Why did he leave? Because his team got beaten badly. Who beat them? The Cavs. The Cavs broke them.
It's a mans game dude

Depends - have you only been following them for 2 seasons?
Yeah man that Steven Curry guy looks like he's pretty good l
Draymond Green pouting on the bench might be better TV than Game of Thrones.
Mouthpieces flying like arrows from bows. Maybe it *is* better than Game of Thrones
I was disappointed that Curry hit a fan with his mouthguard tonight.  If only he followed the example of his teammate Harrison Barnes, who refuses to hit anything at all.  
We mustn't forget: Fuck Draymond Green.
I feel like Game 7 is going to be the absolute culmination for LeBron's entire career. Been labeled aa bit of a choker (by some) his whole career and always a very polarizing figure with where he falls on the list of all-time greatest NBA players. Now here he is, coming back from down 3-1, against the best regular season team in history, playing Game 7 on the road, and a chance to finally get Cleveland (his hometown team) a title. All year we thought this season was about the Warriors, but I think we might have been wrong. The Warriors were only a part of LeBron's story.\n\nNow having said that, the Cavs will maybe throw a stinker and it will wind up being about the Warriors and their resiliency after they win Game 7, but man I feel like we are living in the middle of what will become one of the greatest NBA stories ever. Just feels like a storybook ending is coming our way on Sunday...
reading this gave me the chills. so true

How does Klay make those comments about this being a man's game and head for the showers before the final whistle? Did he get his feelings hurt?
They said dejected if I heard right. 
Definatly wasn't respected. Maybe he thoughts need to be collected. Otherwise his performance will be affected but I think it's all connected.
MAYBE HE NEEDS A BABY BOTTLE 
That's splash Bros\nBasketball 
I love how ever since the draymond fiasco lebron has been in full on "fuck you I\'m lebron james" mode
LeBron is a fucking god. Holy shit.
what's a God to a King 
From the 5 minute mark of the 3rd quarter to the 2:26 minute mark of the 4th quarter [14 minutes 34 seconds], Lebron James scored or assisted on every single Cavs point [With the Exception of the Kyrie Irving Techincal Free Throw]. His stats during that time 25 pts 4 assists 3 rebounds 1 block. Wow.
GSW has yet to lose 3 in a row. So they've got that going for them I guess.
One of two teams to have defeated the Kerr Warriors twice in a row \n\nOne of two teams to have defeated the Kerr Warriors three times in a single season \n\nThe only team to have defeated the Kerr Warriors four times (they've now done it five times)\n\nThe only team to have defeated the Kerr Warriors on the road in both seasons with Kerr at the helm \n\nThe only team to have defeated the Kerr Warriors twice in a row in both seasons with Kerr at the helm \n\nThe only team to have defeated the Kerr Warriors twice in a row with one of those victories coming on the road, a feat they have now accomplished twice \n\nThe only team to have defeated the Kerr Warriors by double digits three times \n\nThe only team to have defeated the Kerr Warriors by double digits three times in a single season \n\nAnd the only team to have defeated the Kerr Warriors in a Game 6\n\nFor what it's worth, I think this says more about the Warriors than the Cavs, but goddamn if we aren't privileged to witness LeBron James.
Steve Kerr getting fined...
I don't think he's not expecting it. 
pump your brakes bro. 
that's not a thing people say\n\n*edit: he edited it and now i look dumb but ill embrace it
Slow down your brakes    \n     \nYea man, totally, slow down your apparatus that slows you down
Careful... I posted that when they were down 3-1
True, but you probably shouldn't bring that jinxiness upon yourself
Lol I highly doubt you would be happy with losing game 7
I wouldn't, but I didn't say that. I said I'd be happy with how we fought back.
LeBron only played great because Draymond was suspended!
I will now go to the no Bogut excuse personally. 
But Warriors fans told me that injuries were not an excuse for last Finals.
I like you, and at the end of the day it's not like anyone was killed or maimed, except for Harrison Barnes' negotiating tactics
He's your version of Kevin Love apparently 
BRO NO LIE, I WOULD RATHER HAVE A TRASHCAN PLAY INSTEAD OF HARRISON BARNES

#All those "Cavs when healthy" jokes sure backfired didn\'t they?\n\nLeBron Fucking James with yet another career-defining game. He just needed the help this year. \n\nCrazy how much his efficiency goes up when he\'s not responsible for literally every offensive possession huh? 
Yes, because as we all know the Finals are a 1 on 1 streetball game where the best player wins every single time. Benches do not exist. Teams do not exist. There is only I in basketball.\n\nI would think the Mavs would be the least salty of the Lebron haters...
He's got more rings and MVP awards than Dirk.
A lot of those losses have been against the greatest teams of this generation.
Wait. Are we talking about Mark Cuban?
Wow this is mind numbingly dumb
Yes, but I don't see why he brought up that he can't finish series when he's already won twice 
> he's got a point.\n\nI don't think so. It's a ridiculous assertion. But then, those who downvote him are probably of the opinion that 73-9 don't matter for shit if you don't win the ring (I also disagree with that) which is kinda hypocritical. 
Wait is the NBA suddenly 1v1? Because if it was LeBron would be like an 8 time champ by now.
They always come out at the funniest times, lmao.
He's 2-4
3-4 would sound a hell of a lot better especially when you look at who he played and with who.  The only series you can say he straight up choked was against you guys, last year he should have gotten mvp and this year he should regardless of what happens in 7.
But he was responsible for nearly every offensive possession in the second half.
To be fair the Cavs would probably be better if Love was injured again lol
As a casual fan, I just want the city of Cleveland to get SOMETHING good this generation.
Kerr already campaigning for the refs favor in Game 7 as that fine keeps rising.
HE\'S THE MVP, HE SHOULD GET BULLSHIT CALLS
I just want to watch the NBA completely fuck with everyone and suspend Steph for Game 7
I still can't believe he let his emotions get to him like that. While I doubt the NBA does anything, he couldn't completely fucked over the Warriors in game 7... Same with draymond after yelling at the ref
No reason to, they already got their g7. Who wins is irrelevant. Hype already sufficiently generated. 
Literally nothing anyone would say after that moment would make any sense from here to the end of time. They'd fuck up every single possible narrative lol
Steve Kerr gonna get one big fine for this press.\n\nEdit: watch the press conference again, he argues by saying Steph is the MVP of the league. It shouldn't matter how good or bad a player is.
So glad i've stopped my irrational hatred of LeBron and am now able to enjoy his greatness.
Why do you refer to yourself in the third person?
Kerr decided if he's going to be fined...he's really going to earn that fine 
It's hard for a finals game, but objectively speaking the calls did seem pretty bad. Not unbalanced though. 
Close enough for it to not matter. 
Kind of surprised no one is really talking about how curry is being targeted on defense. The cavs are abusing him right now and the warriors haven't really been able to adjust yet.
Warriors played like Lil Bow Wow did after he lost his Jordans in Like Mike.

If Iguodala isn't 100% by Sunday Cavs roll. No Bogut for rim protection, and Draymond has 0 chance at stopping LeBron. 
Everyone still giving Kevin Love a hard time. Apparently no one here has ever had a concussion. Takes longer than 6 days to feel back at 100% after one guys. He isn't playing up to his normal standard either but damn guys. 
Mo Speights in 2 minutes outscored Barnes, Iggy and Livingston. Fucking deplorable
Lebron got in curry's head. Stop saying it was rigged when both teams nearly had the same fouls, yall are just salty af 
Refs have been equally shit all series more or less. But ya people forget refs took Kevin love out of the game quick as fuck and just because he's having a shit series it gets no attention.
Dude you can't say that curry fouled out on those fouls. At least 3 were pure bullshit. 
The fouls on curry were ridiculous, and he and klay were the only bright spots on the Warriors team. I feel like the game would have been much closer had be not been screwed by fouls 
That sequence where steph fouls out and that offensive foul on klay. Fucking ridiculous. 
You could almost argue that 6 fouls against the Cavs in the first 5.5 minutes of the 2nd was what prevented the blowout from continuing.
So true. This dude is the definition of golden child. Why the hell would you even reach like that with 5 fouls and you're in the back court? Curry can only blame himself
It's an even more questionable decision to reach. He was surrounded by 3 Cavs players, best case scenario they get 1 extra half court (not fast break) possession. Worst case, you lose your top scorer.
Honestly bscause he's used to getting away with reaches 
This is the correct answer. He was reaching all night, but it\'s "fuck it, let em play" basketball during the finals. 
And Warriors fans bitching about that call... need to check their privilege. 
Exactly. People go on and on about how it was a bad call, and I agree, but you gotta be smarter than that. 
Total fouls isn't always the best indicator it'd when they happen. Curry getting two quick was huge, first one an obvious foul on him, second could have been a charge on lebron. Congrats you now have the two time MVP on the bench for more than half the quarter. Fouls 5 and 6 were super soft too.
It's always the last fouls everyone remembers. What about Love basically fouling out straight away on a phantom call?
> Lebron got in curry's head. Stop saying it was rigged when both teams nearly had the same fouls, yall are just salty af \n\nNa man its clearly rigged. Lebron called up Silver and was like yo, suspend Dray and he got on his knees and did it. Then he said kick Steph out with 6 fouls and he made it so. Lebron just has too many connections. He told silver to make it so he puts up 40+ points, and it was so.
He also asked Barnes very politely to go 2-27 the last two games. 
Shaq was 1/22 from 3 for his career...I feel like he could hit 1 of his next 5 at this age\n\n
Shit, I think I could make at least two open shots if you gave me 27 tries. 
I shoot like ten percent from the arc when I'm dicking around at my local gym. Max contract for me pls.
Lmfao  Chauncey and the crew looking at SAS like he's a homeless guy ranting at pigeons
If LeBron puts up another 40 point game and is near a triple double, would this be the greatest performance in NBA finals history?\n\nhttp://www.basketball-reference.com/awards/finals_mvp.html\n\nHard to best Jordan's 93 season, but:\n\nhttp://espn.go.com/nba/player/gamelog/_/id/1966/lebron-james
PLAYOFF LEBRON is flat-out ridiculous.
LeBron James is good at basketball.
Lebron with 41 points (16-27), 8 Rebounds, 11 Assists, 4 Steals, 3 Block, 1 TO. What a performance even by his standards.
Kerr is getting out coached. I like that he preaches patience but at what time will it light a fire underneath the Warriors? Cavs have found the same height weakness OKC had yet Kerr still is not adjusting to it. Varejao might flop a lot but he's the only big right now that gives Thompson any trouble. Barnes and Festus struggled on both ends of the floor tonight and Kerr kept them in too long. Barbosa has continuously proved he can handle more than garbage time minutes yet Kerr puts him in late af every game. Livingston should get more minutes solely so he can help on the defensive end. Curry/Green pick and roll which was their bread and butter during the season has all but mysteriously disappeared. We can keep being patient but that means we'll be patient through the Cavs lifting the trophy as well. 
Awe it looked like Sager was tearing up. 
oh ayesha you dope - your husband's team has been babycoddled by the league for 73 wins this season... get a fucking grip on yourself... the whole damn team has imploded
Both her and Steph starting to look like they literally don't know how to react to defeat. Embarrassing honestly.  
No one ever could have played better in that game than Lebron just did. So much respect for him. \n\nFuck Draymond.
Now I also hate Draymond, but shouldn't we thank him for awakening the beast with his trash talk?
Game 7 will be really good, last time warriors were put against the wall in do or die they play their hearts out, so should the cavs, oh baby
How is LBJ going to get robbed of Finals MVP if they lose Sunday? 
I have a huge nagging feeling that we're gonna get a real classic. Like somebody hits a game winning 3 down 2 or some shit
GREEN: THIS AIN'T A LEGIT WIN - WE UP 6-0 AND ABOUT TO CLOSE IT OUT 7-0 BITCH
Lil B's curse was too strong it spread to the warriors
LeBron also had 5 blks and 3 stls... Jesus. 
In Steve Kerr\'s post game interview he kept mentioning how he couldn\'t believe they\'d call "the MVP of the league" on specific fouls. Is he implying that Steph, as great a player as he is, is supposed to get special treatment in terms of officiating? I\'m having trouble wrapping my head around this.
who knew richard jefferson would become so important? he's just like shane battier out there.
Why is it that when the dubs lose to any teams this playoffs, it always seems that they aren't the same team who got a historic 73-9 in the regular season?
Finals predictions: LeBron dunks on Curry in overtime for the win so hard that Ayesha divorces him.
Neutral guy at the game here. Just seeing the Cleveland fans after the game really makes me want the Cavs to get the title. There was so much fucking joy on the way back
After watching Believeland I'm rooting for Cleveland too. 
You should\'ve seen it. Every damn car was honking with fans cheering. There were chants and a ton of "fuck steph curry"s. I gave high fives to hundreds of people I\'ve never met and will probably never see again. It was unreal
Ayesha Curry now playing victim in these new tweets: https://mobile.twitter.com/ayeshacurry/status/743656952710967296
Spends all week insinuating shit against Cleveland, plays the victim card for sympathy\n\n"Why are you picking on me!"
Like it\'s one thing to say something stupid, but how in heck do you tweet something stupid. I mean you have to type that shit out on your phone, correct all your errors, re-read it, and then you go "yeah I should tweet this out for the world to see"
Lebron talking to Craig after the game was amazing. Two of the all-time greats.
LeBron was a beast tonight. Back to back 41 point games? Damn!
Kerr should have put Barnes out there for the garbage minutes. \n\n"This is where you belong right now."
Goddamn I can't stand Steven A Smith. 
Remember, [the NBA app had declared the champions way before](http://imgur.com/BzD3dob)
Warriors crying about Barnes he is like their 4-5th best player. Look how awful Love is playing. Cavs stars are outplaying the Warriors stars its not rocket science. 
There was a moment when Craig Saiger painted a mental picture of a victorious homecoming for Lebron and you could see him almost tear up at the thought.  Cavs fan or not you have to respect that kind of drive.
They havent made a SportsScience on the Curry mouthpiece throw yet?
The average player only shows his mouth piece only once or twice a game, but Curry shows it an incredible 573 per game at an average angle of mouthpiece to lip of 57 degrees
Everyone talking about how the officials rigged it... Both teams had 25 fouls, how is calling the same amount of fouls for both teams rigging it?
The Cavs might actually make history winning after 3-1
Can you imagine how big that would be for Lebron's legacy? Beating a 73-9 team in the finals after going down 3-1? Jesus
Until you remember it's Cleveland, and the universe would implode if they win. 
It was fun while it lasted.
Warriors have no right to cry conspiracy after the series with OKC. 
A lot of the overreaction is because they are used to the benefit of the doubt. And not used to losing. 
Yes, but their fans don't know that. 
Varejao doing some camera work I see. 
Lebron being all classy to Craig Sager, nice.
Dude, that was awesome. Did you see Craig's face? He was almost in shock. He just got a compliment and a hug from one of the greatest in history of the game. No one was expecting that less than him, Lebron came out of nowhere with that. 
Yo, if Golden State pulls a Cleveland and absolutely blows this series, does Cleveland's curse is broken and all their bad sports mojo just up and move to the Bay Area?\n\nEither way, if the Cavs win this I'm betting a hunnid on the Browns winning the Super Bowl.
Wow Steve Kerr sounding like a jackass.
Holy shit, Ayesha just tweeted \n>I've lost all respect sorry this is absolutely rigged for money... Or ratings in not sure which. I won't be silent. Just saw it live sry.\n\nClass act
Steve Kerr is so salty. \n\n
I'm for the Warriors. I want them to win. I seriously am in absolute awe at these cavs though. As far as I'm concerned this series is over. No matter who wins the cavs absolutely unequivocally deserve it. And I know that the cavs will win it. In fact I will donate $500 dollars to the charity of the top comments choice on the next game thread if the Warriors win. I will shave my eyebrows and wax my whole body too. The cavs will 100% win. I guarantee it.  
ESPN is literally talking about the refs, Steve Kerr did nothing but bitch about refs, klay Thompson is bitching about the refs... How is LeBron James the bitch? These guys can't take a loss and Ayesha curry fuck! Cleveland please fuckin win. 
Steve Kerr calling out Cavs players for flopping and yet he has Anderson Varejeo on his team.
Kerr: "I\'m happy he threw his mouthpiece"\n\nKerr\'s gonna suspended along with Curry. 
damn good game cavs. you guys buried us in the 1st and that was the difference. nothing to do with refs. even if people believe calls were one sided, that wasn't why we lost. 31-11 is why we lost.\n\nwe are gonna come out firing in game 7 and hopefully we get a close game.
Whoa... A logical Warriors fan... Jesus tits, they do exist.. \xf0\x9f\x98\xae
I love seeing level headed fans. I'd buy you a beer
[removed]
Cavs only shot 3 more FT's. 
In as much as it hurts to say it, good game by the Cavs. Hopefully the Dubs win game 7.
Game 7's are usually always blowouts, but at the same time it's at Oracle but Clelveland is 1 game away from a title and that means CLeveland is going to play like their lives depend on it. This shit will be a good game I feel, but I think Cavs might barely pull out with a win, even though I want GSW to win It's hard to see Cavs lose now with all their effort.
I didn't see the press with Kerr. Can someone tell me if when he said Curry's fouls were inappropriate, did he mean BECAUSE he was MVP or did he mean an MVP shouldn't commit fouls like that?
Curry: I'm worried because LeBron is the best basketball player in the world!
The Chosen One is finally fulfilling The Prophecy from 2003.
If game 5 was given to the Cavs to extend the series, game 6 was *taken* by the Cavs. Right from the start, they were switched on and ready to fight. Warriors looked a bit stunned, as if having Green back in itself was going to secure them another easy win.\n\nReally can't wait for game 7 now. Great series!
I'm rooting for the Warriors but the refs didn't cost them the game, their bad habits did.  \n\nThey gambled on steals, swiped at balls in the back court, shot hero shot balls, and just didn't get back on defense.  \n\nEvery run they made was ended by one or more of those habits and that's why they lost.    
I think it looks really bad when a coach is trying to call out players on the opposing team for flopping like Steve Kerr just did in the post game. Varejoa is on you're freaking team dude. Not to mention curry has been flopping quiet a lot this series, and it was a foul. Pompous as fuck. 
I'm losing respect for Kerr right now.
Shitty that we've lost two straight but so proud of the comeback the Dubs put on. Great couple of games for the Cavs, this game 7 is gonna be brutal
JOIN THE DELLY SIDE OF THE FINALS 
I know this thread will all be memes so I'll give my assessment of the game:\n\n* Not having Bogut is killer. LeBron carved the paint easily.\n\n* Warriors shooting was garbage, aside from Curry. No more explanation needed.\n\n* Thompson was godlike on the glass. Best player on the court besides LeBron.\n\n* Love was effective in limited time.\n\n* Draymond Green complaining all game long (screaming) shows who the real bitch is.\n\n* Steph Curry *should* be suspended for throwing his mouthguard into the stands. Any other player at any other point would be suspended. He won't be.\n\n\n**Side Note outside of game**\n\n* Ayesha Curry calling the Finals rigged for ratings is probably the funniest thing of this entire series.\n\n
He is out for 2 months minimum.
thanks.
So....you're saying theres a chance.
How many overtimes do we need in Game 7?
24 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 1440 minutes in a day. 1440 times 60 for two months is 17280 minutes total, divided by 5 since 5 minutes per overtime quarter....3456 quarters of play until we get BOGUT BACK CAVS FUCKD!!!\n
> Steph Curry should be suspended for throwing his mouthguard into the stands. Any other player at any other point would be suspended. He won't be.\n\nI'd agree in any other game.  But game 7 of the Finals between GOAT-status Lebron and the winningest single-season team of all time?  No.
No fucking way should Curry be suspended, I'm rooting for Cleveland but that would be the biggest disgrace in sports if they take out the biggest key player for something so chicken shit and meaningless.
>Love was effective in limited time.\n\nMaybe on offense, but once again, dude was a massive liability on defense. He just doesn't know how to guard klay/steph. He is either over aggressive or not aggressive enough and creates a lane for them to drive in. 
LeBron is undisputed top 5 to ever play even if he never wins another title
I don't know if it's recency or what but I'm fully convinced he's better than Kobe
Bryant is a better volume scorer. That's it. LeBron is superior in every other aspect.
This is the defining line. Not only is he better in other aspects, he's leaps and bounds better.
Really not a question. 
Sets the stage for the most anticipated game in NBA history. That's right, I said it.
I'm glad Draymond sat this game out to allow LeBron to score 41 again
LeBron James, the poor kid sleeping on a couches in middle and high school vs. a privileged pre-madonna Steph Curry in game 7. I for one vote LeBron. Dude has fought against the odds and haters. Curry reminds me of all the rich entitled kids I grew up playing against. 
*scans*  \n  \nPrimadonna. Not the singer before her first recording contract. 
LMAO at all the people crying "RIGGED" in the game thread
God, angry Warriors fans are the best 
NBA, why are you making us choose between Game of Thrones and Game 7?
Its not even a choice man, there\'s this new thing called "on demand." Watch Game of thrones later.
Guys I think the lion is awake
don't care if cavs win game 7 or not, Lebron has successfully defended the land and proved that he's still the king
I'm actually amazed. People really think this series is fixed. I don't have any words
Even if GSW win Game 7, I still feel they don't deserve it. \n\nI felt OKC outplayed them 24 quarters out of 28 quarters in that WCF series.\n\nNow in the Finals, I see that Lebron and Kyrie are much, much hungrier and showed more heart than anybody on the Warriors team.  
I'm just sitting here in the office, upvoting everything.
I'd like to take this time to ask the basketball gods to please allow LeBron to have a monster game 7 and win one for the land. Also basketball gods, if I'm not asking too much, could you please make Curry have a bad game? Amen.\n
Lebron played amazing, but I really think Tristan Thompson deserves a shoutout for his play. Dude is all hustle. 
I'm not gonna get much sleep before Sunday. This feels like the apex for Lebron in terms of legacy. I know the Warriors are at home but I feel like Lebron is on a mission and there's nothing you can do. 
GS played like the kids at my gym lmao 
inb4 ayesha gets hit with a technical for this tweet http://i.imgur.com/fhmI13v.png
Kerr getting fined for this lol
Why does he keep saying that the mvp of the league shouldn't get calls on him? I agree that at least one of those calls wasn't a good call but it shouldn't matter if he is mvp or not? 
I legit don't understand how people are going to talk themselves into wagering on game 7. JVG said the Warriors would be heavily favored at home and I understand why but holy shit, good luck slowing down a pissed off 4 time MVP with a hobbled Iguodala.
Now golden state knows how OKC felt
Fuck yes! King James brings down 41 pts again 
JR Smith is such an entertaining personality, lol.
Thanks Lebron now I can't watch Money in the Bank this Sunday.
Very low key, Steph set the record for 3s made in a NBA finals
So if the Cavs end up losing on Sunday (not saying they will) will LeBron still be known as "choker"? I personally have never really considered him a "choker", but I just wanted here your thoughts. 
This game 7 has the potential to be an all time classic. So much on the line: Gsw validating their 73 win season or Lebron bringing the championship back home. Whatever the result, I just wanna see a great game and am thankful for such an epic series that has been surprisingly tight despite the blowouts.
Cavs will win game 7. With Bogut out it's so easy for Lebron and Kyrie to get to the rim.
Warriors best players literally hitting people in the nuts, throwing mouth guards at fans, having their daddies and wives complain about refs and Lebron and still it'll be Lebron that the media tears to shreds if he scores under 30 in game 7. Fuck the Warriors. Go cavs
Klay also left the game early, because he got his feelings hurt.
FULL CIRCLE YOU GUYS, OKC UP 3-1 only to lose the series, time for Cavs to do the same!
Fuck those asshole fans who booed Kevin Love. He put his body and mind on the line and came through. We\'re going to Game 7 because of a team effort that included him. Once again, fuck those cunt "fans" 
Literally the most unsportsmanlike group... I cannot believe it.\n\nCurry - yelling and throwing his mouth guard, hitting a FAN\n\nKlay - literally LEAVING the game\n\nKerr - publicly saying that the league MVP shouldn\'t have calls like that made against him (is that what he\'s saying? regardless it\'s tacky)\n\nMrs. Curry - tweeting how the NBA is rigged and promptly deleting it... Like after she is constantly preaching being "classy" \n\n\nI get it. It\'s the Finals. The Warriors are frustrated, they got outplayed. But this... These are your most public faces and they are not serving you well AT ALL. Honestly, I expect more from them, just as players, coaches, and family. \n\n\n\nJesus. Christ.\n\n~rant over~
They are making Draymond Green look downright classy.
Craig about to cry b/c of LeBron
I'M JUST HERE FOR THE KARMA
Lebron + Craig interview is legendary
Holy shit this was the most satisfying past two games\n
Lebron should be finals mvp even if the cavs lose for real this year
Hm I don't know how anyone can watch the NBA and think Lebron isn't the best player in the NBA. I hate the guy but you have to give him his due.
 It's funny how James is a bitch but steph has his wife and klay had his dad send out their beefs...
Jesus, the Warriors sub is unbearable after a loss.
http://i.imgur.com/OJzRdFG.jpg
Usually I'd say motherfuck Lebron & the city of Cleveland but damn I think I'm starting to really believe.
I will say one thing..IF the Cavs lose Game 7, Lebron will take that loss harder than he's ever taken one. He's thrown his heart and soul into this series.
I've always made choke jokes about LeBron. Never again. What a machine. \n\nI've also never been a fan of the Cavs but I'll be cheering them on in Game 7 to beat the Golden State Children/Nutcrackers. 
So much love for LeBron from these reporters... Curry was seething while being asked about how well LeBron was playing... can feel that all the shit that's happened in the past year has gotten way deep into his head. He actually believed his own hype...
Dub nation is high in sodium
Lebron dad dicked us all night and it was incredible to watch.
LeBron if you read this, the GS gameplan is letting you score assuming your jumper sucks. If you make jumpers, we win the series. Every time they have a press conference they make a point of saying how much they don't care about him scoring. He needs to be 70% from 2 or hit outside shots and apparently they have no gameplan. 
Imagine the shitestorm this subreddit will be if the Warriors blow a 3-1 series lead to lose it in 7 just like OKC in the Conference Finals
With Steph Curry fully exposed as 100% bitchmade? Couldn't have written a better Hollywood ending.
The award goes to Harrison Barnes
I'm sorry but there's no way in hell curry is better than lebron. lebron just coasts through the reg season now because he's old.
Tonight, Steph was a fuccboi, and LeBron was a fuccman
Steph was the only Warrior who actually showed up
Steph gets hate for being "too perfect" and "too civil," now he gets hate for being so competitive that he\'s pissed off at a BS foul. Dude can\'t win.
I disagree entirely that they were correct. There were some objectively bad calls.
Lebron being such a nice/civil guy in post interview game, he literately counters all the haters here.
Fouls: 25-25\n\nBut clearly, it's rigged because Curry gambles multiple times and gets judgement calls against him that we see get called every game in the NBA. 
http://i.imgur.com/TEAzQFx.png
Ayesha looking dumb out here, claiming this shit is rigged. She's great normally but don't be a sore loser after that OKC series. 
Steve Kerr filling buckets with his tears during press conference
Kerr being the ultimate sore loser right now.
The Warriors subreddit is so salty right now. They're blaming the whole loss on refs. Pathetic.
That Bay Area entitlement 
Bron still the best player in the NBA...fight me
Is it safe to say that this game is a legacy defining performance for Lebron and if they win game 7 then it would just bring him to a new holy shit, Michael Jordan level? Like I wasn't around for Jordan when he was awesome, but I'm pretty sure he never had to go up against a team as stacked as the Warriors. And what Lebron has done already (just in the last 2 years, not to mention his career before The Return) is just amazing to watch. Idk, I'm kinda drunk right now, but oh my god... Somebody say something...
IMO if the Cavs score more points than the Warriors on Sunday they're gonna win the championship
The motherfucking King. All the hate. The disrespect. The utter indifference that people have shown throughout the years as Lebron continued cementing himself as one of the greatest players this sport has ever seen. It's come down to the most important game of his career. A game 7 against the winningest team of all time. In their house. What will he do next? Drop 50? Stay tuned. 
Wow, People are destroying Ayesha Curry's twitter with stuff like this.\n\nhttps://pbs.twimg.com/media/ClIAGYEVYAQm1Et.jpg:orig
haha, LeBron just said he's chill... he's in chill-mode... THERE'S ANOTHER LEVEL
Draymond going to blame this loss on the fact he played this game.
please let JR drop 12 3's in the way that only JR can.
Double T and LeBron's play. oh lawd\n\nguys help i think my erection is gonna last for a year\n\nAlso, shoutout to Steph for apologizing to the fans who got hit with his mouthpiece lmao
Draymond should absolutely be suspended for Steph's mouthguard throw
HOLY SHIT LEBRON.\n\nThat was legendary. It feels phenomenal to witness greatness like this. \n\nThat was a GOAT level dad-dicking performance. 
Kerr talking about flops? He is coaching varejao and crying about flops? Are you kidding me?
Regardless of what happens in game 7, fuck everyone who disrespected us and said we had no business playing with this team.  
After all those years getting abused by my boy Elway, then Jordan. I really do hope Cleveland get a championship in something. I'm rooting for you! 
lmao Kerr complaining about flops when he has Curry and Varejao.
Curry flopped on every shot coming around a screen.
CLEVELAND CAVS PERSONAL FOULS: 25\nGOLDEN STATE WARRIORS PERSONAL FOULS: 25\n\nso fuck the fuck right off with your excuses you idiots.
Bruh..... NSFW\n\nhttps://twitter.com/bertskicks/status/743656840085573636
Wow Steve Kerr losing respect from me right now in the press conference. He literally said Steph doesn't deserve foul calls because he's the MVP. No wonder these dudes act so entitled. I like Steve Kerr but what the hell
OH MY GOD FUCK STEVE KERR FOR THIS POST GAME INTERVIEW\n\nSeriously saying you're not allowed to call fouls on a guy just because he's the MVP. He used to be cool and level-headed, but that's because he hadn't felt the sting of failure before. Now that he's on the cusp of choking away a ring, he's showing his true colors. Fuck this fucking guy. \n\nI hope to GOD the Cavs win game 7, if ONLY for the epic shitstorm baby fucking tantrum he's going to throw. 
Gotta love the "NBA is rigged" Golden State crowd. It sure as hell wasn\'t rigged when they came back from a 3-1 deficit against OKC right? 
I remember the rigged posts then, too. "Gotta hand-deliver Steph to the Cavs! NBA needs its ratings!!!!"
Kerr is acting like a bitch in the press conference. He forgets the phantom calls in the first half that benefitted his team. Not to mention the first few games of the series when Iggy was getting away with slapdowns.
LeBron found playoff lebron!
Perfect set up for another disappointment in Cleveland sports history.
Lebron is going absolute beast mode. He has literally dad dicked the entire Warriors team in back to back games.
I hope game 7 is called fairly
There isn't a single Cleveland fan that is confident right now.\n\nWarriors could have half their team out for 7 and we still wouldn't be confident lol
They are ruthless on Twitter right now. She might want to just log off for the next couple days.
Reporter to Curry:  "Have you felt his (Lebron) juices directed at you this series?"\n\n*PHRASING*
Game 7 is on Father's Day. Lebron is going to whip out his dad dick again boys. 
Stat leaders through six Finals games:\n\nPoints: LeBron\n\nRebounds: LeBron\n\nAssists: LeBron\n\nBlocks: LeBron\n\nSteals: LeBron\n\nThat\'s both teams.
Cav's gonna be champions... book it.
It is so fun to be a fan of the losing team on this sub
Fuck Kerr for his whole "he should get special treatment because he\'s MVP!!" attitude, he\'s a great coach and I respect him but that presser was just a whole lot of nonsense
Warriors fans are made of salt
I was told this would be a slaughter. A sweep. East weak. But a King rose with his mended Knight and said \n\n"No more. I am Lebron Targyeran of house The Land, first of his name. Breaker of rims, father of 3 kids, and dunker of oops. This Iron Throne is rightfully mine and I will not surrender my blood right. Tell the usurpers Lebron Detriot Game 5 is coming."
Can we just play Game 7 without referees?
Draymond might literally murder someone if that happened 
Kerr is such a bitch. MVP shouldn't get special treatment, which is what he's asking for. Furthermore its shameful that he's okay with the mouthpiece throw. I get that Steph was frustrated and got caught in the moment, but thats not something your coach should be encouraging. 
The last two fouls on Curry were bad calls
The steal on Irving was not a foul.
Even though he got all ball, it was still a foul. He was all over his body.
I thought he was fouling Irving before the actual steal. 
He had to go cross body while holding him with his off hand to pick the ball, I know the last play was controversial, but you just can't do that, it's not only piss poor defense, it costs your team. That is a foul. You can state that it's the finals blah blah, but that only is useful if it supports your views, the fouls on Love and Smith were jokes as well, but they also didn't consistently gamble and grab all game.
Yep. It was a reach, not the worst I've ever seen, but foul five was a reach to me. 
This right here.   Curry tries to hold hands through almost every screen and almost never gets called 
Of course it was. Contact all over Irving's left arm helps Curry make that steal. It's a foul. 
I'd say three of them were actually fouls, 2 were complete bullshit, and one was close.
To be fair, he got away with a lot of them tonight.
Yeah the NBA obviously calls the game hard against curry. \n\n\nAre you fucking high? 
So was this earlier in the game: https://streamable.com/ij5z. It was bad both ways. 
Depends who gets blown out. Bias aside, if Cleveland blows out the Warriors it will be considered one of the best comeback and ultimate collapse stories of all time. 
Warriors fans are some of the sorest losers I have ever seen and that's saying something. Especially for a team that has home court for game 7. You guys not only didn't lose the series yet, but still are the favorites.
did lebron really curbstomp that poor cameraman? no regard for human life!
Kerr making a total ass out of himself right now...
for the first time, coach Kerr is shook in a press conference. Never seem him look nervous before.
ITT: People who can't handle a loss.
Cavs were the better team tonight, simple as that. 
My dog scored as many points as **Harrison Barnes** did
Ayesha crying about her boo and saying the league is rigged lmfao
This game wasn't rigged. Stats over fiction. Game 7 should be one for the ages
I used to be one of the fans who didnt want the Warriors to try sign Durant because it would mean losing Barnes and Ezeli.... I dont think that anymore
The narrative based on which team wins or loses game 7 will be very interesting going forward.\n\nIf the Cavs win, talk about a memorable first chip for the land. Coming back from 3-1 against the team with the best regular season record. On top of that, doing it mostly with an ineffective Kevin Love who is supposed to be your third best player. If they lose, you really can't blame anyone barring LeBron and Kyrie freeze up.\n\n\nIf the Warriors win, they will have a chance to three peat and this team will be in the discussion for best team ever. If they lose, I imagine there will be a lot of criticism given towards various players. Some on Curry, some on Klay, some on Green, most definitely on Barnes. However, they will also be the laughing stock of trolls for having that unbelievable season, unanimous MVP and coming up with nothing in the end.
This wasn't bad offense by GS, this was the Cavs stepping up their defense to the next level.  This was great to watch.  Can't wait for game 7.
http://imgur.com/1H01bqs
Eerily calm. Like he knows he's not in his final form yet....
LeBron James too OP. Please nerf
 Cavs shot 12% better from the field, had 10 more rebounds, 5 fewer shot attempts, 2 fewer turnovers, 5 fewer 3-pointers and only 3 more free throw attempts. Rigged my ass. Let me know what the refs have to do with any of those stats.
I almost started to like Draymond Green near the end of that game. They are down ~20, Klay and Steph are out, and Green is still running the ball down the court, and barking out play calls. His heart was in it until the end, unlike Klay Thompson.\n\nUnfortunately, he is a dirty unlikable asshole.
The game was most likely over but fuck that 6th foul call on Curry. 
It was iffy but he should've been smarter. He shouldn't be reaching 50 feet from the basket with 5 fouls
Yeah that foul was questionable but it was too late for it to matter anyways. I've never seen Curry so aggravated. He's usually able to keep his composure even in the worst of times.
I mean it was a foul...he did hit arm. I think the ref should've waited to see if LeBron lost ball, and if he did then should've called foul.
Kerr being a crybaby in the postgame conference.
[Stay classy, Warriors fans](http://i.imgur.com/jixCk0A.png) 
That last one was especially unnecessary, but to be fair there was a massive amount of hatred thrown around by Cavs fans too. The whole thread is a shit show and fun to watch for people who don't care who wins. 
Right because not every fan base does this same exact thing?
LeBron is a monster. Best player in the world easily still\n\nJust gotta respect the mans game
Steve Kerr is actually kind of a moron, IMO.\n\nEDIT: yeah, you're talking out your ass now chief. Cry on.
Kerr... bro... you serious right now? Sounds like he's saying it wasn't a foul cuz he was the mvp...
I love comparing post-game comments.\n\nDurant and Westbrook: Take the bait and insult Curry's defense.\n\nKlay Thompson: Question LeBron's manhood.\n\nLeBron James: Steph Curry is a great player, and the Warriors were the best team in the NBA because of him.\n\nLeBron does not get nearly enough credit for being the most respectful grounded superstar in the NBA. He's come a long way from he and Wade mocking Nowitzki in the 2011 Finals. Hopefully these younger guys follow his lead.
Can we talk about Love's 3rd foul? It was late, and complete bullshit that kicked him out for the whol quarter. 
Amazing... I haven't seen it mentioned yet but LeBron only had 1 TO and 2 in the last game.
twitter got ayesha on full blast right now
Ladies and gentlemen the 96 Bulls record is safe.. 73-9 means nothing without a ring... 
Lebron James is the best player in the world. easily. sure there are some gimmicky dudes who can shoot the ball from far away, but when the game is on the line, when it counts the most there has never been a better player than James.\n\nHe made the entire Golden State team his stepsons tonight.
Klay Thompson all class after the game man. Much respect
The Warriors have revealed themselves as what I always knew they were... a bunch of entitled, sourpuss, sore loser, overachieving bitches who only won last year thanks to injuries and were basically gifted win after win by the league all year long this season to give the networks something for their $27B. And now that they getting exposed hard, the wheels are coming off the bus hard. They have already lost the series, they just don't know it yet.
Kerr complaining about fouls again like a bitch
I'm not sure about that.  I don't think it even breaks top 5 or 10 but in terms of current events, I think it ranks pretty closely behind the 07 Giants taking down the Patriots - and keep in mind, that Giants team didn't have a 'LeBron' either.
Paging /u/bootum\n\nI think you're already at work on the sequel to [Barnes-O-Mac](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgqmCpQkQkk): 0 for fucking 8 with 0 points.\n\nAlso, I'm eating the biggest fucking plate of crow regarding Tristan Thompson. Sorry for clowning on you beginning of the season after getting a huge ass contract. No hard feelings bruh.
**GAME** **7**
When you really look at clay Thompson...he's ugly af
DOES STEPH GET SUSPENDED?! DRAMA
Curry made contact with LeBron twice on that play. No, Steve Kerr, you can't hit another player's arm to get the ball.
Curry showed on a screen, was moving, and reaching blocking James path. That is called on literally anyone.
Yes, the Warriors in the Finals. We were all there.
Salt?
The better team won tonight. Accept it.
None of his fouls were outrageous. And if draymon got his due when he should have, the Warriors wouldn't even be playing right now.\n\nHold the salt.
Oh yeah, you salty as fuck.  Curry did all that shit to himself and you're showing your ignorance for saying Draymond shouldn't have been suspended because he wasn't for what he did to Adams.  *That played a part in his suspension*.  When will you guys understand that?\n\nSo no, that's not the only word I know you salty bastard.
Nah you're just filled with sodium 
No it wont. Either you're a kid or you don't watch basketball
Let's be honest. There were shit calls both way, especially the ones on Love and Shumpert in the first half. Don't act like it was one sided. 
Let's be honest, Lebron is a God.
You tell em Ayesha!!
Cavs had like three key players with three fouls on them at the start of the second? Kids claiming refs are fixing the game when the only they sending Cavs to the bench.
You'll still be able to wear your Warriors gear. It's ok, friend.
Most Warriors fans haven't been Warriors fans for long. It's cool.
There was no fuckery with Green's suspension. The only fuckery was Green being a dumbass. GS fans made fun of Cavs fans last year for complaining about losing players, GS has no right to do the same.
Oh shut up you people look for everything. This is so stupid lebron can do no right. Or are you also mad at steph for going out in a totally disgraceful way? 
Cool story bro.
No one cares. Bye 
Your tears are delicious.
If its rigged why aren't major market teams like the Nets, Sixers, and Knicks relevant?
Hey if you decide to pay triple price for a ticket, you can watch Lebron do that to the Bay Area on Sunday!
He is dying from Cancer. 
And those people are stupid
NaCl
If that's why you want the Warriors to win then you don't deserve to be their fan during the success.
What if Varejao came out in Cavs gear right now\n\n"hey guys what I miss?"
So you're saying Dan Gilbert wouldn't give a ring to a player who played for his team for 12 years and only doesn't now because he was traded?  There's no bad blood.  He played for them this season.  He was part of the championship and will get the ring he deserves.  Even if Gilbert for some crazy reason didn't want him to get one, LeBron loves him and LeBron runs the organization. 
[Uh...](http://deadspin.com/whatever-happens-anderson-varejao-is-going-to-be-a-dud-1780225024)
They shouldn't even give him a ring after that flopping shitshow.
Varejao be like \n\n"I got the job done for y\'all"
Long con

That was my evil cousin Sanderson
Sanderson Varebad
Lol imagine he tries to join in for the team photo.
Falls over due to a slight breeze and isn't included in the picture anyway
But they let him, because "It was me, Steve! It was me all along." \\**rips off his shirt to reveal Cavs jersey beneath Warriors one*\\*
He cashes in his money in the bank that allows him to join any championship team.
Then proceeds to fall on the floor
I dislike some guys on the Warriors, but there's probably no one I dislike in basketball more than him. He just ruins the game with all that BS
Clutching his ear
The only reason he rocks that hair is because it exagerates his floppage.
The much-maligned Kevin Love with the defensive possession of his life.
He wanted a three or nothing
That was the best defense I've seen, and at the best time imaginable.
I thought love has been getting a lot of over exaggerated hate in this sub, it was good to see him close out strong
Steph Curry, unanimous MVP, forced into taking a contested pull up three by an unathletic big man who is constantly criticized for defense. Absolutely insane defense from Love, he wanted the win just as bad as anyone out there
The negative reddit comments really motivated him to greatness. \n\nWe did it!
My heart dropped when I saw he switched the pick onto Curry, but damn if he didn't step up big time in the clutch.
I thought it was over. I couldn't believe Love was doing such a good job there. He was seriously playing D like his life depended on him. He was zoned in
I could not believe that. Draymond got that screen to ensure the switch and love ended up FORCING STEPH CURRY into a terrible three.
Terrible 3s were curry's preferred shot in the second half
Terrible 3's sounds like his next shoe
Pretty much all season he's taken a lot of awful 3's, his magic just ran out I guess.
When people say "Why is Stephen Curry so hated", that\'s why I dislike him a lot. Not his wife, or mouthguard, or being arrogant, or any of that shit. \n\nIt was that all season, he chucks up these god-awful shots from 25, 30+ feet with 10+ seconds on the shot clock, and even though they are terrible shots for anyone else except Klay Thompson, all people would say is "Well those aren\'t bad shots for Curry!!!"
and its not just his shots, he made some terrible behind the back passes
Because a player can't go an entire season making those shots and still be proclaimed as terrible shots. \n\nI get it. He didn't even play at an All-Star level, let alone MVP level, this series. Or last year either if we're being honest. But similar to LeBron in 2010, that doesn't somehow negate how good of a player he is. It just means he has something to answer for next year. Are we just going to assume Curry forgets how to shoot and he becomes a 38% 3 PT shooter the rest of his career? I would hope not. 
Personally that's what I'm hoping for.\n\nI'm aware this will not be popular.
A voice of reason on r/nba?
I have such an anti-Curry boner right now it's not even funny
Go see a doctor if it lasts longer than 7 games
its called priapism ppl
Imagine if LeBron actually made that dunk at the end. 
I would've spontaneously combusted on my couch.
I might have ran to Cleveland.
I actually prefer that he didn't. The drama of Lebron stepping to the line with a hurt wrist with a chance to put the game out of reach was so dramatic. So dramatic that it probably took a year off my life, but it was worth it.
Nah, that award goes to Varejao.
We're debating which of his plays at the end should be iconic, that's how great that guy is
It would be the iconic image of his career. That would have been unreal. 
the play from a couple games ago where he trips and gets the pass off only to slam it down is also up there
Yeah, but he'll have to settle for the iconic image of sinking that free throw after hurting his wrist with all the pressure in the world on his shoulders. 
Nah the block is now the iconic moment.\n\n
Yeah I remember thinking as he was leaping up, **this is it**, but then he missed and I was like damn. 
That effort still sealed the game. Draymond's foul was actually a great play on his part. But holy shit if he made it for the and one...
missed. He was straight up hacked to stop that dunk.
We still have The Block. I think that will be his iconic image for a long time.\n
http://media.gettyimages.com/photos/lebron-james-of-the-cleveland-cavaliers-blocks-a-shot-by-andre-of-picture-id541546580
I hope it becomes known as The Block. Would complement The Shot so nicely.
That block was clean as my momma's floors.
LeBlock
To be honest, his signature play in my mind all these years are all those awesome playoff blocks sprinting down the court, much more than any layup or dunk he's gotten. Not just tonight.
He's gotten like 5 of those during this series alone.
Yea but that one makes the league mvp look like a high school player. 
Be nice, we all know Curry stopped in the middle of puberty, you don't have to point it out.
Good news Warriors fans, you can get a free Dorito Locos Taco because of your Game 4 win! 
I feel like your comment is incredibly underrated. 
it'll be the soggiest, saltiest taco i've ever had... Fuck it I'll take it. 
That reminds me, say hi to your mom for me.
She also has a soggy, salty taco... is the joke he was making
Ah. Haven't heard it referred to as a taco in a while hahaha damn. My overwhelming sadness must be getting the better of me lol
So, a regular taco bell taco?
That block by LeBron on Iggy at the end ... Man that is a man willing his team to a victory. Came from no where 
Had barely sat a minute and still went all the way down and blocked it at the top of the square. 
[If anyone hasn't seen it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QJ4iwqnLKc) (Edit: about 20 seconds in)
The second I saw that I knew the game was over. LeBron absolutely dominated that game. Ho-ly fuck.
well it was actually kyrie who hit the winning shot and love who didnt let curry get a shot off on the switch
True. I think it was just the emotional indicator for me.
After that block, the Golden State Warriors (who score any number of points whenever the fuck they feel like it) did not score a single point in 113 seconds. \n\nAs you said, that block ended the game.
lebron was god dam legendary today. when nba 2k 30 comes out, youll play as lebron and replay this game. the block, the crying, the fall, this was the game that define a player. \n\ni thought the pinnacle of lebrons career was 2013 game 7, but yet again he tops it. i feel this is truly his pinnacle because of the circumstances
I think that saved the game. That had a classic Warriors run written all over it. He gets that to go, they get the momentum and might run away with the game.
I lost my mind when he got that block. If he would have dunked over Draymond there at the end, I'm pretty sure Steph would have had to give back his MVP award.
Dude I know.  That dunk would have been insane.  I can't stop thinking about it. 
Every play since the 3:00 mark or so my reaction was "Oh my fucking god"
I swear the score was stuck at 89-89 for like 6 hours
Everyone Fed on his energy I swear to god. KLove cuffed curry up for 10+ seconds of clock. 
After a season and a playoff where the two supporters were questioned,  Love and Irving finally came through tonight.  Love was like "every rebound belongs to me" for the first 8 minutes. 
That was a play you make when you just straight up REFUSE to lose the most important game in your life. Gave me chills.
Petty ass bitch
Surrounded by GOT fans I had to lose it there. They legit think I'm insane for saying game 7 was better than episode 9.
Episode 9 was legit great, tho. That Sansa smirk. 
This and Boston game 6. One to avoid infamy, and one for all the glory. Big time players make big time plays
mama, there goes that man
> Big time players make big time plays\n\nI hear this in Stacey King's voice, every time.
For all the crap Draymond gets he's still out here congratulating the cavs. Klay is already in the locker room
Honestly Draymond was the only warrior who showed up.
Dray is a competitor. Klay is a great player but he's got some growing up to do. 
Because klay is an ass hat. 
Is he really? Because I'm looking for a new player to hate on since draymond seemed like a decent guy at the end
Klay is a bitch \n\nHe was poking fun at LeBron in post match conferences when they were 3 - 1 up too 
This is the reason hes a bitch. I dont havfe a problem with players walking off the court early generally speaking. I get it, you just lost game 7 of the NBA finals. I dont expect them to be perfect.\n\nBut if you are gonna talk shit when you're up 3-1, call your opponents babies, exc exc, You gotta man up when you get dad dicked
It's easy to talk shit when you're winning. Klay needs to put on his big boy pants and act like an adult.
Hope his dad gets in his ear about this.  
Well his dad was talking shit too
It's one thing to talk shit, it's another thing to not congratulate your opponent when they beat you. I'm fine with shit talking,  I'm not fine with being a bitch when it's thrown right back at your face.  
My dad said something that stuck with me after the ECSF: "Never ever give your opponent something they can stick on their wall and be reminded of." \n\nThis is exactly what Klay did. He should have saved the trash talk until after the Finals were over. Instead, he gave the Cavs (and especially LeBron) some extra fuel to burn.
Hot Take City
Reminds you that you can be a good dude when you're not competing.
I give dray a lot of shit but that was classy. Klay is a sore loser
His feelings were hurt. 
I think he felt disappointed in himself.  It probably wasn't disrespect.    If Green had a shit game, he probably went to the locker room crying too. \n\nEdit:  He probably was mad he fucked up the play before the last one. 
I think it's okay to be a sore loser after you lose a close grand final game 7 you've dedicated most of your life to. \n\nI get sore when Junkrat kills me in Overwatch...
Idk man, it must be pretty overwhelming. Maybe he just knew he couldn't handle being out there and thought it would be better for him to be in the locker. \n\nIt's easy to criticize, but it's hard to say how many of us would react in that situation. \n\nAwesome of Draymond though. 
For all we know he went back there to cry his eyes out and he just didn't want everyone to see that it isn't automatically disrespectful
Exactly. No one is berating him because he was emotionally devastated after the loss, any loss is painful and a game 7 this close would b gut wrenching.\n\nPeople are on him because he called out LeBron for basically being soft, then he *hypocritically* expresses the same sentiment.
> it's hard to say how many of us would react in that situation. \n\nWe would all be exquisite gentlemen, holding the door for Ser LeBron and tipping our vicu\xc3\xb1a fedoras at each and every fine lady Cavali\xc3\xa8res fan in the Oakland crowd, allst while cutting down feckless weaklings like Klay Thompson with the cold taste of Nippon *Hagane* (\xe7\x8e\x89\xe9\x8b\xbc, or steel, for the ignorami).
99% of the users here would lose their shit
Not me. I'm a man, and a father of three children.
I hate the Warriors but there's nothing wrong with going to the locker room after a tough playoff series loss come on man. 
You can't say it's a man's league and that someone got their feelings then take off cause your feelings hurt. 
klay has done this every time they lost
I couldn't handle it for sure. I'd go right into the locker room and bawl. \n\nBut I also wouldn't have called out LeBron James for being too sensitive, either.
Doesn\'t matter, he showed that he was a cocky kid without emotional control. You don\'t goad a guy that has owned basketball for more than the last decade after game 4. You go out and say these things happen, things get heated, out of my control, yada yada yada, and then you win game 5. You don\'t say shit about it being a "man\'s game." Any player with an ounce of self control should know the slightest insult can set off a superstar and be able to steer clear of doing so. Instead, he blabbered, and we got the greatest comeback in NBA finals history.
I agree, when watching of Splash Bro's i always thought Steph and Klay were really humble and whatnot. Whilst the MVP has proved that he's human also a pretty good and chilled guy, the latter showed he's just a world class player with little common sense. \n\nReally sucks because now he'll get demolished by both sets of fans for a) poor performance since G3 and b) his cocky attitude that went straight down LeBron's path where him Kyrie owned him and his team for the last 4 games. Feeling sorry? Yes, because he worked hard but not because he was cocky. 
I love this narrative
It's also at least the 2nd game this series that he's gone to the locker room after the game without saying a word to anyone.
Steph and Dray really were classy after the loss. Klay on the other hand...
I saw Steph talking with Irving for a bit and then handshake/hug.  Klay immediately power-walked to the locker room with his bitch face on.  Draymond blew my mind by powering through the sea of people on the court right up to Lebron and hugging and congratulating him.\n\nIt kind of makes sense though,  Draymond just threw down a monster game, I wouldn't be too upset if I was him.  Klay seriously under-performed and I think he's mad at himself.
Well. Considering what klay said after they got stomped by the blazers this year. It's pretty clear that he's an asshole.
What did he say? 
That it was a Fluke. This was back when they didn't lose all the time. 
He did the same thing after the Bucks beat them.
Can't forget Klay walking to the lockers before everyone else before game 6 ended.
Technically Curry went to the lockers first.
Klay Thompson\n\nsalt level: oceanic
>dead sea
Dude has resting bitch hair. Never looks happy.
Klay looks like the sensitive backstreet boy.
Yeah, like I don't know what he's out there for on the court cuz after all, its a man's game. Take your hurt feelings outta here!
Draymond is a piece of shit on the court but a good dude before tip off and after the final buzzer. 
Nah, Draymond is the new KG
I think when he is thinking about what he is doing he is a great guy.  When his mouth or his foot gets away from him he can be a prick, but when he\'s "paying attention" he\'s a solid dude.  He has that little kid ADD sometimes.
He handled himself well tonight.\n\nAfter winning the championship last year he handled himself poorly.\n\nI hope that means he's, like, learning life lessons and shit. Becoming better.
he's the epitome of the guy that you love when he's on your team, but hate if he's on the other team. Can't help but respect him- he's earned everything the hard way, and is incredibly driven.
> Can't help but respect him\n\nWe talking about the same player? How the hell have people made a complete 180 already? Dude is dirty, you can respect his hustle and drive, but he's dirty, makes illegal plays (screens) all the time, and worst of all, he gets away with it since hes a good actor. You're free to like him, but he's one of the dirtier players in the league. \n\nI have no respect for someone who intentionally hits people in the nuts.
Exactly, he's basically a Noah 
Noah with an offensive game. 
He probably is good at ark building and animal gathering now that you mention it. 
Draymond...fucking played like a king today. steph and klay did SHIT.
Showed who the real MVP for the warriors.
Dude was on point for his 3 game.\n\nGreat series though, all in all.
No one should be disappointed, this game 7 is one of the best games all time.
Yeah gotta give Draymond credit for hanging round to congratulate the Cavs. You just know it was the last place he would want to be but he stayed and did the right thing
I saw some clips of Curry talking with Irving on the court and stuff too, I think he stuck around some.
Curry did stay. They showed Klay walking into the locker room earlier though.
Ah okay, I thought people were implying Curry had left. TY for the assist.
Even tho im a dubs fan, this series has shown what a one trick pony curry is. He was outplayed by Irving the whole series.   
Currys been exposed
Dude what... I'm not even a Warriors fan but I'll defend Curry against someone saying he's a one trick pony. He absolutely played shitty this series but he still won regular season MVP for a reason. He lost the championship so now he's a one trick pony? Lol 
If he does not make his threes, he has a super bad game. He is the definition of a chucker. I will give it to him that he is a great finisher and decent passer, but he takes really bad shots and when he is off from 3, the whole team is going down. 
Cmon man that's an overreaction. His bread and butter is his 3 point shot but he's still an incredible ball handler, play maker, and great at going to the rim. Sure the rest of his skills really shine when he's hitting his 3s but he's definitely not a one trick pony.
he did get outplayed though. curry is a great player who showed his weaknesses this series.
He was a one trick pony in this series. He hasn't been finishing around the rim nearly as good as he does during the regular season and has been making lazy passes. Like so many times he'd try to bank it off the glass but it won't even hit rim. Whether it's due to fatigue or injuries slowing him down, he isn't the same
He has to get rid of those dumb passes he attempts to make. I think he said himself that turnovers are his biggest problem. And then he does that stupid behind the back that completely went out of bounds. 
Seriously, I told my buddy while watching that stupid pass that this is the finals and to win the finals you gotta take a page out of the Spurs book and play fundamental, showboating won't win in a 7 game grind like this series was.
At that juncture of the game too. Don't make a 1st quarter pass in the 4th quarter. 
I AM HERE TO OVERREACT
/r/nba is the only place where an unanimous MVP, who was one of the handful of players in nba history to go 30, 5 and 5, who was in the 50/40/90 club, who lead the NBA in steals, can be called a "one trick pony" and be met with unimaginable support. But you\'re right, not an overreaction at all. No one this entire year was calling Steph a one trick pony until the playoffs. But you\'re right, Steph is complete filth without the three ball.
Feels like a breath of fresh air seeing a Warriors fan admit that
Lol, its not true. He's a one trick pony because he lost in the finals...makes sense. 
Yeah seriously. He's a one trick pony because of a bad couple of series where his team was one game away from winning a championship. He must be the first one-trick pony to be a top 2 player in the league who can pass, shoot, and drive.
So then does the fact that Lebron is three for seven in the finals tarnish his legacy in your mind? I'm not trying to diminish what Wade has accomplished, he's the best two guard outside of Kobe since Jordan played. But the season that Curry just had was astronomical and just because it isn't 'worth' anything doesn't mean it isn't the strongest indicator we have of a player's abilities. Someone loses in the finals every year. Its a team sport. The Cavs outplayed the Warriors when it mattered most but that doesn't define the type of player Steph Curry is. To say that is as big of an overreaction as people calling him the GOAT during the regular season.
>But the player he turned into is without a doubt better than prime Wade and its really not that close.
He's just bad on d and you can gas him with bigger defenders.  Not a perfect player, but great player.
I don't think HGH is allowed
He\'s as much of a one-trick pony as Dirk Nowitzki is.  Both of them just have a huge advantage in one area and they tend to "spam" it accordingly
He's as elite a passer as Joe Flacco is
He was a Heat fan 2 years ago
Is he a Cavs fan now?
I hate Draymond, but he played great... I give him props.
he earned my respect with his play today, as well as his post game attitude.
I found a lot of respect for him, seeing how he fought through the crowd to congratulate LeBron and the Cavs.\n\nStill think he's a bit of a dirty player, but good to see that he's more than a decent man.
Being a dirty player doesn't make you a bad person. Adams, T. Thompson, D. Green, all great people.
Generally agree, with at least one caveat: Bruce Bowen. He is a total piece of shit. Has no issue with trying to ruin guys' careers with his fucking bullshit.
Yo that body check on to Steve Nash is still maybe the hardest hit ive seen in an NBA game, Nash was so fucked up like his free throw air balled 3 feet away from the net.
The way athletes play their sports doesn't always reflect their personality. Off the court he's always struck me as a good guy. 
Steph stuck around too. Klay was too busy angry fucking Varejao while he just flopped around like a rag doll in the locker room. 
I fucking lost it. Good lord that's an image I didn't need in my head lol 
God dammit I'm never getting that image out of my head. 
3-1 is a bitch this season! OKC leads it and now GSW and they both fucked up!
had no dogs in the fight until GS was 3-1... then i wanted their fans to feel my pain.
Clippers are the NBA hipsters and started the 3-1 trend first. 
At least we didnt choke at the biggest stage, with homecourt advantage, and after having a historic season, and a "Unanimous" MVP.
Congrats on your 2nd place!  History makers!
You're bragging about not being able to get a lead? Lol props for not choking quite as hard I guess.
That clutch 3 at the end by Irving was huge. They finally did it. Wow.
BALLS. OF. STEEL.
STEPHANIE CURRY HOLD MAH DICK\n\nEdit. Lmao. Stupid auto fill in. Although  Kyrie did make curry his bitch 
Not a Cleveland fan but uncle drew killed it. Now I have a reason to buy his shoe.
Best part is how smug GS fans were after games 1 & 2 talking about how last year Kyrie and Love being hurt didn't mean anything. 
The biggest fuck you to curry, the Warriors and the Bay Area 
He outplayed curry all series minus game 1/2\n\nCurry deserves a fuck you.\n\nRegular season shooting god, MVP.\n\nPlayoff time? Nah, not even remotely close.\n\nHe's exposed.\n\nHe could barely outplay the  cavs last year without kyrie (HE HAD DELLY ON HIM AND HE COULDNT WIN MVP COME ON)\n\nThis year, kyrie proves who's the SMARTER Pg\n\nI'll take a smart PG like kyrie any day over a guy who takes and makes bad shots and tries cute passes all the time. \n\nCurrys ascension is amazing to behold, but he's a product of lazy defenses in the regular season\n\nCome playoff time he's not consistent enough,  and players actually play tough D. \n\neven if he can string together a couple hot shooting nights. \n\nHes a shooter. Not a true PG.
This is ridiculously reactionary. He was everything more than a shooter for 164 games counting last seasons regular season \n\nAnd then 2 bad series and he isn't a true point guard? The fuck is this shit idk how people can up vote this 
In fairness the Warriors offense doesn't particularly lend itself to assists; Curry gets a lot of hockey assists, similar to how the Spurs point guards don't have high assist rates.\n\nAssists don't neccessarily indicate an ability to pass and move the ball,Curry is a fantastic ball mover; he's not Steve Nash, he's not even Ricky Rubio and his cocky and lazy passes really damaged his team this postseason. \n\nHowever I wouldn't say he's a one-trick pony.
Oh reactionary
You're on the championship post game thread. The responses aren't exactly going to be measured.
Yeah I can't tell if that dude is serious or if he's just listing all the incoming hot takes
We have a whooooole offseason of reactionary incoming friend. 
You guys played a one man team last year. 
Nah Steph legit got outplayed. Accept it
how many "open" threes did he really miss? maybe like 5-6 in the last 3 games. that\'s normal. He also missed lot\'s when he was forced into bad shots. That\'s playoff defense and intensity. It\'s not like he hit every open three in the regular season either.
I mean, he set the all-time record for most three pointers in a Finals series. But okay. 
He also tried to get stupidly cute with passing. And it led to points for the cavs\n\nLook the man is a an all time great shooter.\n\n But if he's not hitting shots, what good has he been???\n\nI'm talking this series. This playoffs. \n\nHe's defense? Mediocre. His passing and setting up his team? Mediocre. \n\nSet all the records he wants for shooting. All that matters is what he did in the end.\n\n
if this isn't a joke its one of the dumbest comments ive seen
This sub has the memory of a gold fish
> tries cute passes all the time\n\nHis behind-the-back pass attempt to Klay near the end was hard to believe. It wouldn't even have gotten Klay that great of a shot.
Kyrie does some pretty dumb shit too from time to time. Even if a majority of this series he was a maestro. 
The game winning 3 over the 3 King.
That three in his face, he will remember it for a long time coming. 
I'd argue that Love locking up Steph at the end there was just as big
Yep, for all the shit he took, he was all over him there at the end to shut it down FTW.
Hey Steph, hold my beer and watch this...
all the needy kids in Africa can now get some dope 73-9 + 2 titles warriors gear thanks to Kyrie
Those african kids gon be like damn the Warriors finally dethroned the King after his back to back championships w the Heat and Cavs!
I hope they get really comfy, unused UA shoes too.
*Shuffleboard Lows
A couple weeks later they show up on Curry\'s doorstep marked "return to sender"
I\'d rather go barefoot
They\'re going to be *super* confused when the "back to back" gear comes in and they look at last year\'s line that says "2015 NBA CHAMPS: CLEVELAND CAVALIERS."
Those kids are gonna learn a lot about the world that day. 
Clutch block by Lebron too.
To me, this was the bigger play down the stretch. Completely changed the game. Would have played out very differently if gsw went up two on that layup.\nImage how tired LeBron had to have been playing all those minutes and sprints to make a monster play. Unreal.
It flashed to LeBron right after that block and he was clearly tired.\n
I mean Kyrie did score the only basket in the last 4:39 of the game, but that was a great block by Lebron.
Kevin Love also locked down curry one possession for a full shot clock
I love that all 3 of the big 3 had their moments in the closing seconds
How does LeBron always have a big three when most teams cant even get a big one. 
He didn't to start his career.  After that he chose the teams based on what they could get/had.  Cleveland had to trade for Love if they wanted LeBron back, so they traded for Love and 'Bron signed.  Miami had to trade Beasley's cap for seconds to clear space for vet signings.  James basically called the shots and got who he wanted. 
Look at the roster of his first finals team with Cleveland vs. San Antonio and you tell me if you wouldn't look for some help.
I'm glad Love played well enough that people would stop saying he hasn't contributed much in the finals.
Wow to his +19
What does the +/- column represent? 
the difference in points your team scored vs conceded during the minutes you played
Double wow that it wasn't for his shooting but for his defense
Lebron fucked around, got a triple double.
Along with two steals and three blocks...such a shitty, championship clinching triple double.
Damn, I thought people could see sarcasm. 
It would've been amazing if he had flushed down that dunk in the final moments. It would have been the highlight of his highlight reel.
Bruhhhh I don't think a human had ever jumped that high and cocked back a dunk so powerfully in all of history. That would have been so gnarly. 
It would probably the most memorable dunk in all of basketball history. A dunk over Draymond to secure a championship? Shiiiit...
But it made the game so much more intense that he had to hit two free throws and missed one, leaving the W's with a chance. 
I can't believe, today was the Cav's day
That's fucking greatness. Everyone would say meh to this game, but it is a fucking td 
The Lakers beat the Supersonics.
Didn't even have to use his AK
I'm sitting here saying Lebron had a bad game, then see he has 27 points. Just goes to show how high our expectations are of Lebron. 
I thought so too, he even scored more than Kyrie (26) while getting a triple double. 
27 points, 11 assists, 11 rebounds, 3 blocks and 2 steals. \n\nFuckin scrub.
3 blocks, but THE block was worth 10
The block that impregnated half the arena. 
New saying for Clevelanders to say: Where were you when The Block happened?
It\'s impressive rewatching it in slow mo but every time he gets one of those blocks live he seems to come out of no where and just be like "NOOOOOOO"
LeBlock
https://i.sli.mg/eoigeL.gif
$10 says it already happened in the last hour, twice.\n\nEdit; We're pretty fucking classy like that.
It was truly a good day. 
Didn't even have to use his AK. 
What a fucking Game 7\n\n\nEdit: what a fucking season too
Yeah as an outside fan it was everything I had hoped for. Really close, and right down to the last seconds. 
Couldn't ask for anything more as an NBA fan. What an awesome season, and what a spectacular Game 7. So much for the Warriors' immaculate regular season. Congrats Cleveland, you deserve this! LeBron definitely commands the respect of every single critic now. 
Nobody can deny how good he is. \n\nWe are still allowed to hate his fucking guts though. 
Don't you mean you don't like him as a player?? He's a good person out of the court.
I don't get why people hate Lebron so much. Is it just because he wins all the time? Is he just like Tom Brady or Derek Jeter? 
... The NBA is a for-profit business. The fact people are talking so much about the move to Miami so much even today proves how extravagant of a move that was. So yeah, there is a need to milk it. Especially since the 6 million he made from that all went to charity.
Dude but that shit happened what like 6 years ago? Get over it
Yeah, and if you look at the way he talks now he's calmed down a lot from his early years. The dude has been hyped as the second coming of Jesus since he was 16, and you don't expect it to go to his head? I know if I were in my early 20s and had the world at my feet I'd probably revel in it a bit more than I should.
I think people regard "The Decision" as one of the more selfish and douchebag moves in sports. 
Well at least that $6mil went to charity, which trumps any personal opinion about someone seeming selfish. That good outweighs a lot of the butthurtedness 
Yeah, but he admitted that was handled badly. And you should read his letter when he came back - it was adorable and fixed it all in my book. People need to let that one thing he did so long ago go.
I think people get bitter that he keeps eliminating their teams. I personally like him though. 
From Ohio here, as I\'ve said to people around here that complain about Lebron. He doesn\'t owe his home state shit. He\'s an athlete he can do whatever he pleases. Nearly every one in this state would leave in a heart beat if you told them "Hey I\'ll give you hundreds of millions to do what you love in any place and you can probably be the best at it / win the championship version of it." 
I would have been super pissed at the Cavs organization if I was LeBron. Years and years he got no help from his front office who expected him to do it all on his own. It's impressive to me that he handled leaving as well as he did, even if it was messy.
He met my friend when he had a stroke at a young age, back when the cavs were here in the bay area for their last championship series. He'll always be ok in my book.
I can't right now, not for a couple days. I watched him play his first game, and the journey...\n\nI'm happy for Cleveland. I have no more words. 
I have to wake up for school in 4 hours but I'm so fucking glad I stayed up to watch this game.
Once in a lifetime game. \n\nGet some potent coffee and swallow a no doze in the morning. \n\nTake a map after class. You'll be good. 
This was the first ever start to finish NBA game I have watched in my entire life. This was an amazing game, so back and forth. Are games normally like this? You can consider me a basketball fan from now on.
Welcome aboard, took you long enough, get ready for a new hobby. 
This was probably the most exciting game of this past decade.
You're not kidding. This is an all-time great game. We are witnesses.
I like the heat spurs game too
Heat-Spurs was crazier for me, but that was more because of the environment where I was watching it.\n
Yeah, that game 6 in 2013 was my all-time favorite NBA game ever.  Game 2 of the 2011 Finals was also pretty great.
I'm still putting game 6 of the 2013 finals above it, but I'm pretty sure this one is 2nd.
Pause what about Game 6 of Heat/Spurs when that last 3 pointer hit to force a game 7 
No that game sucked and we don't need to talk about it really...
Recency bias
If the Warriors could have come back from 4 down then that would have topped it. But yeah game 6 2013 best game of all time. 
**[*TRIGGERED*]**
No they are not always like this. But there are a ton of games on every night during the regular season so you are bound to catch some great games often if you watch all of them. 
Found Adam silver. Nice try man..

It had everything a neutral fan wants in this kind of games.

I WAS TOLD THE FINALS IS THE WESTERN CONFERENCE. 
WARRIORS VS. SPURS WILL BE THE REAL FINALS THIS YEAR
the finals is the western conference... AND THEN THERES LEBRON JAMES!
LEASTERN CONFERENCE AMIRITE?
BEASTERN CONFERENCE
Lebron is the bonus boss level. 
More like red at the real ending of gold/silver
He's one of those bullshit bosses where you're feeling good after winning the game and then he just wipes your whole party out by himself, causing you to rage inarticulately about how stupidly overpowered the devs made him.\n\nFor Eastern Conference diversity's sake, LeBron nerf pls
The Nameless King
Like the warriors beat the soul of cinder no problem, then thought they'd give nameless king a spin.
my favorite part was when curry throws the ring into the lava at the end.
My favorite part was when Lebron fucked the Warriors like a dirty cunt. 
Based on his throws today, he'd miss the lava
savage as shit\n
I'm pretty sure the mouthguard was his final accurate shot of the series. 
LeBron blocks it
And looks back at him in disgust. 
And we meme about curry getting daddy dicked
Curry will be shooting shots in the driveway, his dad (LeBron) comes out and says he can take one more shot. Then LeBron blocks it, looks at him in disgust, and tells him to get his ass back in the hous.

Seriously, we all just witnessed one of the most memorable seasons and playoffs ever
None of the playoff series will be remembered except the finals and WCF. And people will probably forget just how bad some of these games were
But the ones that mattered were epic.
That was maybe a better game than Spurs-Heat 6. 
And all people did was shit talk instead of appreciate witnessing history. Best season ever and first finals victory after being down 3-1. Just stop hating and be thankful you got to witness history.
i remember my dad waking my up to watch the last play of bulls /jazz game 6 in elementary school and telling me "i was about to watch history"... this feels similar.
I guess the "We Are All Witnesses" poster will be going back up.
Lol Delly looks like that one fan that managed to sneak in to the trophy ceremony and celebrate with the team.
Why didn't he play more? didn't he play a lot more last year?
Irving was out from a game 1 injury
10 seconds left and up by 4. It was all set up for Cleveland to Cleveland in the most Cleveland way in the history of Clevelanding.\n\nBut gosh darn it, they actually held on. They won. By golly.
When Lebron went down I was sure that he had broken his hand, GS would tie the game and win it in overtime. That would have been the most cleveland loss ever. 
Hell I thought Cleveland would be Clevelanded out of a title when James went down holding his wrist just before going up 4. They're up 3, they get the foul... and their superstar hurts his wrist and can't shoot FTs and let the best 3 point shooting team ever get a chance to shoot one more to tie the game, and then he can't play in overtime and it's over.\n\nBut he hit the second. That was bigger than Kyrie's 3, I thought.
As a neutral fan this still would have been the worst possible ending to this game.  Thank you basketball gods for not letting that happen.
That fall scared the shit out of me. But I forgot LeBron has an adamantium skeleton.
The Fall
This went through every Cleveland fans head.\n\n
Can confirm
Seriously all I could think was "man this is going to be absolutely soul crushing," and then it wasn\'t. I kind of don\'t know what to do with myself right now.
Masturbate.\n
When he was setting up to shoot those free throws, triggered Kawhi..
I didn't know how to feel at first. I kept expecting some shit to happen that would make us lose somehow with 0 seconds on The clock
This game took 5 years of my life.  My heart's going to be racing for another hour at least.
I fear tens of thousands of Clevelander will wander the city for the next few days, in awe. God knows we have enough guns and illegal fireworks to create Nam. Everybody in Cleveland will have PTSD.
Kevin Love has never lost an NBA finals game 7
On a Sunday
He had big 14 rebounds and kept them in it in the first quarter with all of those offensive rebounds.
and he stepped the fuck up all jokes aside
His shot wasn't great but his defense was not bad and he was all over the boards. He had a great game, they absolutely do not win this without his 16 rebounds.
Love's performance will go under the radar. He played 100x better than the rest of his game this series.  He remembered he could rebound.
Had a good game today
No he had a great game today, Cleveland would have been a lot more lethal if Kevin Love hadn't had his confidence shattered
Chairman of the Boards! 
That defense on Curry sealed it. For all the shit we gave him 
His defense all series was pretty solid.  Never found an offensive rhythm and seemed to lose his rebounding sense until tonight, but I think a lot of things were overstated about Love.  This was a tough, tough match-up series for him and we're a team that lives or dies by LeBron...and when Kyrie *and* LeBron are hot, Love just wont touch the ball much offensively.\n\nI thought he came up big tonight, even if he only got 9 points.  Glad he got to seriously contribute in one of our wins, because he's a far better player than people gave him credit for most of this series.\n\nAlso a minor shoutout to Barnes, who is obviously far better of a player than the shit he's been getting too.  He didn't really shine today, but he's a solid cog that most teams would love to have.
I was losing my mind watching Kev defend Curry at the end. I've never seen such crazy footwork. Bravo to him for showing up on the biggest stage.
Having watched him in Minnesota for his whole career I was shocked with that defense.  Like he was a completely different guy.
that defensive play + offensive boards in the 1st quarter. dude was a monster and helped the cavs stay in it early on when GSW was knocking down 3s
That fucking one-handed rebound!
That was my favorite! I think that was his 4th rebound and it was still pretty early in the game but that was evidence that he was going to do all he could on the boards tonight
Kevin Love was locked in. He had every part of his body in this game, in every moment, every split second. I felt his intensity through the screen. 
They probably threatened to not let him watch GOT tonight if he doesn't play well hehe.
They threatened to spoil it for him during the fourth quarter.\n\nSeriously though, I'm torrenting it right now and I'm super fucking paranoid that some asshole has left a spoiler on here.
It's all good, downloaded and watched it.\n\nAll I can say is WOW. Between Game 7 and this episode, I think I have more than enough heart trouble to last me the rest of my life.

Sorry Doris I couldn\'t hear that backhanded question over all this championshiping
cannot stand that woman. she has the most stereotypical news personality.\n\ncoash how doesh it feel to be shampion im doris back to you guysh 
Abnoxious voice too.
I don\'t know the exact question but she asked the Cavs owner something like "Two years ago youwrote a letter shaming Lebron...." and Gilbert said "sorry I didn\'t hear all of your question but I\'d love to give a shout out to this team and city...." he basically played it off.
it was a lot longer than 2 years ago
Boss answer to that question. I love how Doris talks about her struggle to compete in her career just to ask that question. Let the man celebrate.
Fuck Dan Gilbert he doesn't deserve to celebrate shit.
Yeah and she also said something backhanded about Love when talking to Kyrie. Usually like her but she was trash during all of that 
hey kyrie kevin was really taking a shit out there most of the series. how did it feel to play with lebron a once in a generation player?
Dude was blatantly lying, but shame on Doris for trying to kill their vibe with a question like that at a time like that 
> James has a Cleveland franchise, his hometown team, one win away from a championship -- one win away from the greatest comeback in NBA Finals history, one win away from upending an opponent that hungers to be known as the greatest ever. Win one game, you win everything. The Cavaliers have never been this close. It is not hyperbole to suggest every step in James\' basketball journey has led to this moment.\n\n> Win Sunday in Oakland, and the dumb, overheated debate about James\' "legacy" disappears from the airwaves forever. There will be no more convenient cherry-picking of his few subpar Big Moment games, no more selective memory to buttress preconceived damnation, no more talk about his emotional fortitude from people who have never had a conversation with him.\n\n> Every NBA Finals carries legacy weight. Every Game 7 lingers somewhere in our memory forever. But this? This is enormous. This is a flashbulb game. This is as big as sports gets.\n\n-Zach Lowe
lol buttress
If you don't mind me asking, do you have a link for this?\n\nEDIT: after a lot of searching here you go http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/id/16312235/2016-nba-finals-how-got-game-7 \n\nGo Cavs
Interesting paragraph \n\n>If the Warriors lose Game 7 on Sunday in Oakland, Green and his teammates will have to absorb the very real possibility that his temper cost them a championship.\n\nBut nope, he made up for it by having an insane game 7 and now Steph and Klay shoulder that blame almost completely in the eyes of most fans, it seems
I still think Green is shouldering a lot of internal blame on himself right now. If he is there for Game 5 this could've been a much different series all around. He played like a madman last night though. I don't like him for his temper and how he seeminglygets away with murder on the court, but I will admit he gave 200% last night and it sucked to see that effort go to waste.\n\nSteph and Klay blew it no doubt. But I think we did a a lot as a team to limit their effectiveness. Either way, a Unanimous MVP should've performed better. Still a great series and game. Can't wait to see The Land defend the title next season.
Maybe he'll stop going after people's nuts.
That's how you write an emotional quote.
Incredibly eloquent.
Lowe is the best NBA writer out there. Absolutely incredible article. Can't wait to see if he writes one after this game.
And he was spot on. Lebron is now squarely on the level of the very greatest legends in NBA history. Jordan, Russell, Bird, Magic, Lebron, etc. will be what people say 15 years from now when they start rattling off all-time greats. \n\nLiterally everything he has ever done as a basketball player was hanging in the balance during that game. A loss could have signaled the end of his era and the cementing of Curry's. And there's a good chance that without another title he would have been defined as a brilliant player who could not get it done in the clutch, who more often than not failed on the biggest stage. \n\nAll of that is dead now. He was a god among men, literally superhuman in that series. I have never seen anything like it. His legacy is set in stone.
I'm so glad the nitpicking can stop. However, I wish there was another way
73-9 isn't bad. But 72-10 just has a better ring to it
They won the same amount of games.\n\n73 + 15 = 88\n\n72 + 16 = 88
with the only minor difference being the Bulls won a title, then again who's counting 
\xc2\xaf\\_(\xe3\x83\x84)_/\xc2\xaf  not me. (I'm so happy right now)
Amen to that brother. 
The Bulls only won 15 games in the playoffs. The first round was only a best of five back then
Ignore me then
Win
Fuck that's clever. 
I'm here from /r/all, sorry if I'm being stupid but this is going over my head. What's so great about that comment? I'm not a big basketball fan.
Basically golden state beat the bulls for the best ever record in a regular season going 73-9 but unlike the bulls they never won the championship aka a ring (winning players get a ring for winning the finals). The joke is that 73-9 is good but 72-10 has a ring (championship victory) to it.
That is clever! Thanks!

LEBRON'S WRIST CALLED SERIES 
That would have been the greatest dunk in NBA history
JR SMITH IS AN NBA CHAMPION!
Lebron with several Super Mutant plays in the last minutes. That block was out of control and then that dunk attempt to get to the line was absurd. 
If he hit that dunk to put the game away I would have probably died 
That block was fucking unreal, one of LBJ's biggest moments ever.
The civil rights act was also pretty big.  But yes that block, though.
LECLUTCH 
I won't lie. \n\nWhen he missed that first ft my heart stopped.
HOW DID HE DO IT 
Lebron absolutely deserved this win. Amazing performance throughout this series (and playoffs).
We're gonna talk about LeBron like old people talk about Wilt. Dudes amazing.

73-9 will have an asterisk.
73-9 is the new 18-1.
Shit any other teams that get a hot streak better watch out, or you'll become the 2016 warriors 
It's worse imo. 18-1 fucking sucked (I'm a Pats fan) but football always comes down to one game, and any given Sunday is a thing. Basketball is a series. You have to be consistent for 4 games to clinch it. The 73-9 Warriors proved that they really couldn't deliver when it mattered, when at 3-1 up they had 3 chances to win 1 game. \n\nHave the 2007 Patriots play those Giants for 7 games and I feel pretty confident that they manage to win 4. We just saw what happened when these Warriors played the Cavs for 7 games.
I mean it's not like the Warriors played the equivalent of the New York fucking Giants. But I'll allow it.

don't mean a thing without the ring
Co-signed, 2015 Kentucky :(

I still can't believe that the first team to blow a 3-1 lead in the finals was the best regular season team of all time. Don't mean a thing without the ring.
Can we all just agree this was a fantastic series and one of the best game 7s in recent memory?
Oh come on, warriors players and fans can't talk endless shit and then ask for a civil friendly attitude once they've lost. 
Na fuck that, GS had some nasty bullshit ass fans at the crowd tonight. I started rooting for Cleveland the moment I heard "cavs you suck".
I think this was a storybook ending designed specifically for Lebron's career:\n\n1. Playing for home town Cleveland after spurning it and then returning\n\n2. Against a 73-9 all time best regular season team\n\n3. On the road at enemy's homecourt\n\n4. Down 3-1 in Finals from which no team has ever come back to win\n\nand finally\n\nTo end championship drought in Cleve- at least we're not Detroit -land
The cherry on top would have been if he made that dunk at the end. That would have been beautiful. I'm not even a huge nba fan and tuned in to watch the last couple of finals games. That dunk would have been a thing of beauty.
No, its way better how it actually happened! I mean, think about it:\n\nHe's going for the monster, game-sealing dunk when a clean foul takes him down. He lands hard on his shooting hand, gripping his wrist in pain. His teammates and his city, shocked, fall silent. \n\nHe eventually gets up and heads to the free-throw linel, his shooting wrist clearly an issue. The first shot rattles out - it's still a one-possession game, still easy for the Warriors to tie it up. \n\nHe prepares for his second shot. One chance to make it a two-possession game. Without this shot, the game is a toss-up. With it, victory is a heartbeat away. The weight of 52 years of heartbreak, and that of history, is upon his weary shoulders. \n\nHe takes a breath, dribbles the ball, cocks the ball back with his shooting hand hinged on his throbbing wrist, and sends the ball towards the basket. Half a country away, an entire city holds its breath.\n\nTime seems to slow down as the ball arcs through the air. \n\n*Swish.*\n\n
Except in reality: *back iron*, *front iron*, barely sneaks in a free throw on a gimp wrist. Even better.
I cannot wait until Monday when I get to video conference with my co-workers in San Francisco.  They have been smug assholes this entire year acting as if the title was a guarantee for them.  
San Fran. in a nut shell. 
You obviously gotta wear a Cavs jersey and championship hat.
I'm not a Cavs fan but I sure was pushed into rooting for them purely becasue of my teammates.

Jump shootin' teams Erneh
As much as people hate Draymond, he did as much as he could to try and win GS a finals. Curry and Klay just went cold, and Barnes stopped being able to shoot at the worst moment.
Bogut injury hurts too
As a Cavs fan and a guy angry at Green, his effort and game tonight was impressive. Deserves respect.
Draymond was the best player on the floor in Game 7 and was the only reason the Warriors were even competitive.
No, by almost any metric Draymond was better than LeBron in game seven. \n\nA line of 11/15 with 32 points, 15 rebounds, and 9 assists with excellent defense is better than 9/24 with 27 points, 11 rebounds, and 11 assists with excellent defense.\n\nThe difference is that Draymond's teammates choked and LeBron's didn't. LeBron was for sure better in the series as a whole but Draymond was better in game seven.
Draymond earned something back on the court tonight.\n\nHowever, the narrative will be that GS should have closed it out in Game 5 with Draymond on the court.\n\nThat's gonna haunt him.
Draymond was on fire this game and nearly carried this Warriors team to victory.\n\n\nI dunno if Curry's injury is as bad as the rumors say but him, Klay, and Barnes didn't step up when the Warriors needed them to.
>But when they win no one says anything about an injury\n\nLet\'s be honest why would they? If Lebron had a fever and had an amazing game no one would bat an eye and say stuff like "Lebron so good he\'s beating the fever like MJ" but if he lost people would say "oh Lebron was playing sick so of course he wouldn\'t do as well".\n\n\nIt\'s just a common response to these type of situations that isn\'t fanbase specific at all.
>...except that he isn\'t hurt?\n\nWe don\'t know the details so I\'m going to give the benefit of the doubt that Curry has something wrong considering he didn\'t look anything even close to the same guy from the regular season.\n\n\n>NO ONE mentioned this "injury".\n\nOkay we\'re back at square one because I already provided my response to this and I cannot fully understand what you\'re trying to say. Can you reword it? 
>He literally just said in his press conference "I\'m not injured, there will be no surgery, I have no excuses for how I played on the floor".\n\nI wasn\'t aware of that since I normally don\'t watch press conferences so my bad.\n\n\n>But please, keep on trying to argue lmao\n\nYou didn\'t have to be a douche about it though.
I don't think he is injured to be honest. Not sure what it is though, but he did lose his swagger after the ankle/knee injuries. Now thats all on him though.
Dray having the best game of his life makes the Cavs win even better.  
This makes me so happy
I'm so happy too. Fuck the Warriors!!!!
>dude, show some class.  \n\nWe are talking about a guy who was finally suspended a game after like his third nut shot of the playoffs. Fuck him\n
 http://i.imgur.com/L6zuJ4S.jpg http://i.imgur.com/c75oebi.jpg 
fuck off, you fucks are always screaming FUCK CLIPS or the rockets. If you can't handle what your fans have been dishing out then just fuck off to your team sub
To be fair, he played pretty clean tonight.  Plus seeing him out there giving congrats to Lebron gave me a little respect for him.\n\nA little.\n\nA very little.
He was doing everything he could to win. Not only this game but all series long. Lebron was also they just have different ways of going about it.
I hate his donkey face, but a great show of class after the game by draymond. He showed up to play and he was actually admirable in defeat.
The joke is from NBA Mean Tweets.
BS. The dude legit resembles donkey from shrek. Not everything is about race. You can't call every insult racist because you don't like it. Dray himself even laughed it off. Lighten up.
> Lighten up.\n\nI *knew* it!\n\nEdit: You guys! I've never been given gold before! 
Perfect. 
its actually a well known [joke](http://pbs.twimg.com/media/CGwqsBhUYAIfeYa.jpg)
If he would've only gotten kicked in the balls on the final play...
I honestly thought he kicked Lebron in the nuts on the last ridiculous dunk attempt lol
Agreed, it would have been a walkover without him. Such a great performance for Dray
Curry was pretty bad as far as MVP standards go the whole series. 
Curry couldn't sink a shit in the toilet right now.  Completely fell off.
Seriously, that's consecutive Finals where he didn't really show up, as the reigning regular season MVP. I'm not sure he would have been FMVP this year even if the Warriors won.
Turrible
That behind the back turnover in crunch time was pretty cringey
As soon as I saw that I said to myself: "This will be an omen." And sure enough. 
By none other than Kyrie fucking Irving.
He won this game for them.. unbelievable
Draymond almost won it for GS, holy fuck I think he made more threes than da splash bros
Man, all of the big 3 stepped up. Kyrie hit that 3. Kev with the GREAT defense on Curry, and LBJ sacrificing his body to put it out of reach.\n\nIm crying rn!
Lebron with the exclamation point non-dunk. If you needed a metaphor...
LeBron won the series
Wut
Yes he definitely did, but kyrie won that game. 
He did have a LeBron game. 27-11-11. Amazing from both players
Lebron has a triple double 
No ignore that. KYRIE WON IT YOU PLEB
Hear me out guys....but is it possible they both won the game?
I need things simple. Tell me who won the fucking game.
My sources tell me they were on the same team, so it's not absurd to think they worked together to win the game. That's pure speculation though, so don't quote me on it.
Rumors coming in that all players on the court effected the outcome of this game, will continue to update
and I won a free tube of cookie dough at the state fair when I was 8. \n\nSo in a way, we're all champions. 
Minnesota state fair, the best fair
Sweet Martha's? 
Raw cookie dough can give you Salmonella.  Be careful 8 year old you.
I had salmonella last summer and it was fucking terrible. Worst I've felt in my entire 29 years.  Not even another bout with it could break my smile right now. 
Upvoted for visibility.
Cookie dough danger awarness. I have learned something today
Diarrhea is worth raw cookie dough imo
Iunno, that block by Lebron was clutch as fuck too.
His iso possessions in the 4th were shit, kyrie saved em. Even his run earlier in the game saved em
I lost my fucking shit at that block. This game was fucking intense. As you can tell I am still full of fucking adrenaline.
That block won them the game imo. Killed momentum
That dunk would have been murder.
I can only imagine. Murdering Green for the win of Game 7 Finals. Just think of the 30 for 30 in a few years if that went down.
Did you see how flustered the warriors got after?  What a game!
The best won tonight.
I'd argue that clutch as fuck defense by Love on STEPH in the final moments clinched it! So nasty!
I was surprised by how well he managed to stay in front of him! I was so afraid of Curry blowing by Love or doing a step-back 3 but Love did really well
Fortunately Curry only wanted the three at the time. Otherwise, it may not have panned out as well.
But, you know, LeBrons triple double didn't hurt. 
I can't believe he took it. Balls of steel.
mr 4th Quarter for a reason\n
Why don't you believe he took it?  The game was tied, so it really wasn't that risky.  Did you see how many missed shots in a row had occurred before that?  Felt like the score was stuck at 89 for 3 or 4 mins.\n\nFor the record, not taking anything away from Irving.  Was definitely THE shot of the game.  So much props for nailing it at that point.
Kyrie is pure clutch.
championship tier player. Shot the three ball in the face of the best shooter in the league. 
Kyrie's balls were so big Curry's shots were stuck orbiting them
He did it! The absolute madman! 
/r/madlads
So i told Kyrie to take a 3 for the championship, and he did it!\n\nAboslute madman!
*shades of "PAXSON FOR 3!"*
Lebron James take a fucking bow. Coming back from 3-1 to this Warriors team is incredible. They will make a 30 for 30 on this one day, no doubt. What a series.
I appreciate how the benchmark for historic sports moments is whether ESPN memorializes them in a 30:30 documentary. 
If he never hits another shot in his career, he's still immortal in Cleveland now.
Funny how times change. Just a few years ago they were burning his jerseys and cursing his name.
I, for one, never thought I\'d see the day that I was rooting for Lebron after the whole "Descision" bit. But goddammit if I didn\'t sit there cheering for him the whole time.
Really solidified his career narrative.  Also the fact that he may have just had two of the like 7-8 best performances in finals history against record setting teams doesn't hurt.  
One of the best game 7s I've seen. Too bad Curry didn't show up. I swear I thought Curry was going to go off for 30 but Draymond had to go shit I do it then. This game would have been of epic proportions seeing Curry go off like he did the regular season. CURRY HAS NO CLUTCH GENE. - Skip somewhere 
The "Believeland" 30/30 is outdated and I love it!
At least I can pretend this never happened until I see it on classics in 20 years. 
As a Pats fan, be ready for random sports center countdowns to give you PTSD.  
Yes life must be tough as a Pats fan. Stfu. 
Can't wait for future JR Smith to do his 30 for 30 interview on a hoverboard
wearing whatever those goggles were during the champagne popping
JR just gave maybe the best post-game press conference ever. Amazing.
http://screengrabber.deadspin.com/j-r-smith-breaks-down-when-asked-to-describe-the-inspi-1782261705
Dude, you're fucking amazing. Thank you for that.
Oh man that was so emotional. I teared up when he was talking about his parents and broke down.
AS A CAVS FAN SINCE 17 DAYS AGO YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW MUCH THIS MEANS TO ME\n
As a person who has hated Lebron's guts since the High School Phenoms DVD came out, you have no clue how upset I am he just got another ring.\n\n\nWait until they put Kobe back in.
AS A CAVS FAN SINCE 17 MINUTES AGO YOU DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH THIS MEANS TO ME
I JUMPED ON THE BANDWAGON 3 HOURS AGO AND IT'S BEEN A WILD RIDE
As a Cavs fan since game 3 you have no idea how much blood sweat and tears I have put in. I have stayed up till 4am every game just to watch the cavs play. I now know their key 7 players names. 
I've been a fan for nearly this entire series so I know what you mean. 
Me too dude!!!!!!! It's stupid how happy I am about this
Me too. My whole family went berserk. Me, my brother, and my dad were yelling, my mom was crying with joy. Somehow we all got so invested in winning one for THE LAND. We're from Phoenix and all Suns fans, so we empathize with sustained sports misery and heartbreaking near misses.
I never put on that flair, but I was for sure cheering for Bron.  It was like, 60% wanted Lebron to win, 40% wanted Draymond to lose.
And me!
In my eyes, it was like 60% wanted draymond to lose, 40% wanting to see the city of cleveland to win because of believeland .... and then fuck lebron
Similar for me, 50% wanna see Green lose, 40% wanted Bron to win, 10% just didn't want GSW to have a better season than the 95-96 Bulls.
Curry seems to think of himself as a god. So watching him lose is always satisfying
People hyped him up too much. He's good, but not *that* good. Lebron was a beast. 
Curry shattered the all-time threes record that he set himself last season. At the same time, his team went on to win the most regular season games in the history of the sport. He is that good. But that doesn't mean Lebron isn't better.
America loves winners, but even more than that, we love to see winners fall
See: Ronda Rousey
Ever since he beat his chest against the thunder I've wanted to see him lose it all. 
For me it was when Green started kneeing Steven Adams in the nuts, shit was crazy man.
Same position, but also couple that with 100% wanting Golden State to lose
And 100000% seeing Jr get a ring for his pipe
JR for sure coming back next season with a championship cockring 
KYRIE I LOVE YOU
fuck pnd
KYRIE IMPREGNATE ME
Damn, Kyrie taking the shot over Curry really made the picture perfect
What a fucking shot
Him and LeBron deserved this series more than anyone else. They played out of their minds.
My dad was a life long fan of Cleveland sports. He passed away last year, but I am so proud of Cleveland right now, and I couldn't be happier that this could happen on Father's day, I know he would be so happy.
This gave me the FEELS I am so happy you are happy :')
Same my father passed last August.  Had the same thoughts.
I'm sorry for your loss.
In the same boat. My dad grew up in Akron. So happy Cavs won but it's so bittersweet I can't celebrate with him.
I'm sorry for your loss. My old man passed away 4 months before the White Sox won it all in '05. He was a die hard fan. It's something I'll never forget, you're going to cherish this for the rest of your life. 
Paulie, Podsednik and Dye absolutely killed it that series, your old man would be proud. I'm a cards fan and my dad is a Yankees fan but baseball is the sport we bond over while we live in Chicago. RIP 
CURRY THOMPSON 6-24 ON THREES FULL LOWLIGHTS??? WHAT DO
[Let me live fam](http://imgur.com/ma1Zg8p)

DO IT NOW
THE GAME NEEDS TO ARCHIVE ON LEAGUE PASS FIRST
I THOUGHT YOU HAD THE LEAGUE PERSONALLY DELIVER YOU THIS SHIT
hey man don't be mean to Curry he was just getting his Dad a ring for Father's Day that's all :\\^)
Do a lowlights with barkley talking about jump shooting teams.
you have to man, curry was throwing up some real bullshit
Chuck city. But "JR on a bad day" kind of chuck city.
He straight bricked at least 2 and klay air balled one 
Klay air balled one in first half for sure. He was pretty much wide open. 
His magic ran out, shouldn't have wasted it on regular season.
IDK man, that long 3 ball made me reallll quiet.
An L made Curry even more quiet
That was the best block of all time by lebron 
No he pinned it
Nope. Bron got to it a millisecond before it hit the glass. 
How can you watch those two plays and come to that conclusion? That's fucking hilarious. 
I lost my shit when that happened. The icing on the cake is he avenged the Heat by beating Toronto. Best consolation prize for a Heat fan.
Clutch block by a man on a mission. Holy shit. We witnessed Greatness.
I just. I can't even fucking comprehend. He aged backwards these last three games. \n\nThat block may have been the most crucial play of his career.
I think it will be one of the biggest highlights of his career 
> This shit so rigged. Why the NBA let my husband shoot 33% and 4/14 from 3? I won't be silent.\n\n-Ayesha Curry.
She's TOTALLY right.  If it wasn't rigged it would have been the Thunder vs. Cavs in the finals.
I think she came to reddit after Steph closed her twitter account LOL
She just swallowed her words\n
Savannah Brinson's also swallowing tonight, but it's not her words.

As a fan of a 38-1 Kentucky.... It fucking sucks. That's all I can say. Sorry, man. 
I appreciate your dedication to carry it to the very end. 
None of the teams in any of the Big 4 pro sports in America that have the best all-time regular season ~~record~~ win total won the championship...\n\n-2007 New England Patriots (16-0, lost Super Bowl)  \n-2001 Seattle Mariners (116-46, lost ALCS) + 1906 Chicago Cubs (116-36, lost World Series)   \n-1995-1996 Detroit Red Wings (62-13-7, Lost Conference Finals)  \n-2015-2016 Golden State Warriors (73-9, Lost NBA Finals)  \n\nEDIT: Updated it to win total to make it more accurate for NHL and NFL and added 1906 Cubs
Also 1906 Cubs (116-36, lost WS)
That's actually a better record than the Mariners.  Why is Seattle always cited as having had the best MLB record?
Best record for a 162 game season
What about the Bulls
Well, yea, the stat wasn't true up until like 25 minutes ago.
Technically the '72 Dolphins went 14-0 and won the Superbowl. Even if it was a different era of football.
If fans still count Super Bowls going back to SB I, then the Dolphins undefeated season definitely counts.. getting annoyed with this stupid Mariners/Patriots stat.
Well, isn't 16-0 a better regular season than 14-0? The statement was about regular seasons.  \n  \n116-36 (Cubs) *is* better than 116-46 (Mariners), though.
This was false before this year. GG Warriors 
Warriors losing and still setting records smh
'72 Dolphins did it. 
Season was shorter then, the Pats technically won more regular season games. 
Truly a record-breaking season by the GSW!
The LLLarriors :(
They sure know how to streak, don't they?
Jesus dude. Have some respect for the recently deceased. 
Nobody's ever allowed to call a series over when it's 3-1 ever again.
People said "yeah but this is different" compared to OKC up 3-1 when GSW went up 3-1. Said Cleveland just couldn\'t keep up or win two road games against the greatest team by record in history.\n\nYet here we are.
I gave then about a 2% chance. The Draymond debacle helped.
This will go down as the most lopsided finals ever. \n\n\n\n- Stephen A. Smith
3-0 we still got tho
Not if you're the Red Sox.
Or the LA Kings.

Well, Golden State was all about setting records this year. Now they get to be the first to lose after being up 3-1 in the finals.
Savage.
Brutal.\n\nSavage.\n\nRekt.
Nippy.\n\nKind.\n\nLangur.
Are they the only team to win a series after being down 3-1, than also lose a series after being up 3-1?\n\nIf they are, that stat will probably be on the front page tomorrow.
They aren't the only team to win a series down 3-1. The Rockets did it recently against the Clippers.\n\nThis is the only time it happened in a finals series.\n
He's asking if they're the only team to win after being down 3-1 (the Thunder) and then lose after being up 3-1 (the Cavs), not whether they're the first team to win being down 3-1. 
ESPN just tweeted about it https://twitter.com/sportscenter/status/744732362387431425
Well they're the only team to lose a finals after being up 3-1 so probably 
There's 4 rounds in the playoffs, so no

I was already torn cause LeBron is my favorite player. Wouldn't want the Warriors to lose to any other player.
this will be a fucking 30 for 30 in 10 years
Seeing lebron get emotional post game makes me genuinely happy that they won

Ahhh yes, the booing of the commissioner, that most sacred and universal of all fan reactions. 
Tbf it isn't much of a contest to be the best commissioner and the fans were pissed that the league office suspended Draymond. 
love draymonds game, but he hit too many players in the nuts too many times
I think it was a mix of booing him cause he's the commissioner and booing him because he's the representative of the NBA and some warriors fans feel like the NBA favored Cleveland 
Thx for being a class act warriors \n\n"BOOOOOOO"

I know right? I'd die if my team blew a 3-1 lead...
I get this joke because U have a clippers flair and the clippers blew a 3-1 lead. \n\n
Did you get the first joke by the OP as well?
Nope do tell??????
Literally last round the Thunder blew a 3-1 lead to GSW. 
Wow no way! Both the Clips and OKC choked on 3-1 leads. Wonder if that happened any other Time during the playoffs??

yeah but their AHL team just won the Calder cup last week.
Lebron should just run for mayor now.  Cleveland is gonna go nuts when they get back.  So happy for James/Kyrie/etc and the Cleveland fans.

Thats.., a weird stat
I mean I get it...they are trying to say LeBron never plays real good teams. It's just stupid.
I'm pretty sure they're intentionally making shitpost stats just for us now.
Its a shop are you blind?
Curry was a major disappointment. You can't be the regular season MVP and then go 6-19 for 17 points in game 7 of the finals. MVPs just can't do that. But congrats to the Dubs for a great season.
Not just that, he really didn't make up for it in other ways. For example, when Kobe was ice cold in game 7 in 2010, at least he did work on the glass with 15 boards. Steph didn't score and didn't really do anything else well either
he watched Irving drain that game winner in his face
Well shit ya got me there
draymond green is the only dude that showed up for the dubs tonight. he was a beast out there (still can't stand the guy though). \n\nsoooo many bricks for the warriors 
And Klay with 14.. Poor form by both.
Honestly, I didn't even notice Klay on the court tonight. I saw him make a couple big 3s, but that's it. He was invisible the rest of the game.
That is something we can unanimously agree on
Ayyy
Is it funny that every member of the big three was crucial at the end of that game? Lebron James' block and ft's, Love's crunch time play defence on Curry and Irving's 3 pointer?. Funny at the end every member played a part even Kevin Love. 
A lot of role players came through this finals. JR with some crucial threes, Shump with the 4 point play, even Dahntay Jones last game got some work done. And of course TT playing out of his mind on the boards.
Don't forget all the good done by old man RJ

Hahah my man 
Anderson Varejao has to be the saltiest feeling person on earth right now.
He can if they want to give it to him. I think they do, Because he was cavalier for so long, and while sure he flopped In the finals he is just doing what he can to help the team he is currently on win. It's not like he tried to injure anyone or anything, flops are annoying but he wasn't dirty really. I think he earned one by being in Cleveland for so long. 
It personally wouldn't mean much to me to get a physical ring. I think any competitor would feel empty if they didn't actually play (in the Super Bowl, finals series, World series, etc) to help their team actually win it. Even if you're injured or something. 
True, really he can say he has a ring but like you said, whats it really worth if you didn't do anything to earn it in that playoffs. It's basically just a nice gesture from the cavs at this point. Not giving it to him would be super petty though, not like Gilbert has ever done anything petty. 
Ive been feelin bad for David blatt a bit tonight 
Don't feel bad for him, they would've lost if he was still there.
Reminds me of Marian Hossa losing the Stanley Cup with the Penguins against the Red Wings, signing with the Red Wings the next year, and losing the Cup to the Penguins.
I posted this in the game thread, but here is what i hope the Cavs will do. \n\nVarejao is sitting in his house when the doorbell rings. He opens the door to find a package that says "from Cleveland". His heart begins to beat in anticipation of whats inside. \n\nHe tears off the tape and digs though the packing peanuts to find a beautiful velvet ring box. Thousands of emotions run through his brain as he slowly opens the case. \n\nInside is a single note that says "fuck you". Underneath is a plastic toy ring with a mold of Varejao as he is falling to the floor like his been shot. \n\nAfter a few monents Varejao grimaces and clutches his chest. He collapses to the floor and stops moving. The paramedics are called. When they arrive they start taking his vitals. The head paramedic freezes and then says, "i\'m sorry to say this, but he is faking it". 
I love you. 
As a Cleveland fan for years, I want Andy to get his ring. He was our heart for years. Was he a flopping bitch in the finals? Yes. But he played as best he could for his team, even though the opponent was his friends and family. I respect that.
For real though, does Varejao get a ring since he was on this Cleveland team? Or do you have to be on the team in the playoffs?
Really? I can't imagine they wont. Spent his entire career with Cleveland, traded mid-season as a salary credit, signed up as a free agent. My money's on him getting one.
From what i have heard, it's the teams decision
Give one to Barnes.
wow....
I can't stop laughing at this. Well done
this is so stupid  but i can;t stop laughing
[Varejeo getting his ring like](http://www.geeksandcleats.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/klay-smiling.png)
I never noticed this, but Klay's face looks like [the mask Ryan Gosling wore to fuck shit up in Drive](http://i.imgur.com/Xo67dCz.png).
David Blatt died for this
Kevin Love's defense on Curry was incredible on that last possession.
THAT BLOCK WAS THE GREATEST THING IVE EVER SEEN
Can you imagine if he landed that dunk too. Two of the biggest plays in the Finals.\n\nDraymond lucked out nearly on the biggest poster in NBA history lmao..
God damn, If only be landed that dunk 
The only regret I take from that game lol
My eyes dilated and time slowed down when I saw him rise for that. 
Warriors went 73-9 in the regular season.\nLebron and crew became the first team to overcome a finals 3-1 deficit.\nKobe's 60 point farewell game.\n2016. What an incredible year for the NBA. 
MVP chants for lebron in the Oracle. So satisfying.
Boo'ing too which is super annoying.
I'd take booing over shit like getting spit on and yelled at. I remember in High School there was this stuck up town we always go to they had a jerk off parade before every home game and would spit and curse at high school bands and teams as we passed them, even the adults. Shit is unsportsmanlike and pointless. It's a game a bad call or something happens grow up and take it on the chin.\n\nP.S Fuck Rocky River 
Nah. Basketball is just a game, and games are supposed to be fun. I don't begrudge them for having their particular form of fun. 
Now I can tell my kids that I witnessed the rebirth of Cleveland sports domination.\n\n***2037***\n\nChild: "Daddy! Daddy! Tell me again about King James bringing not one, not two, not three, but six championships back to the land!"\n\nMe: "Honey, I\'ve told you that story a thousand times! Don\'t you wanna hear a different story?"\n\nChild: "I\'m sick of hearing about the Cleveland Indians winning four in a row!"\n\nMe: "Well... okay. But next time I get to pick what story to tell. I\'m sure you\'d love to hear about NFL HOF legend RGIII and how he led the dynasty Browns to seven Super Bowl wins in eleven years."
Stop, my penis can only get *so* erect
Please, Lord.
Look on the bright side, Warriors fans. First time y'all lost in the playoffs since you started watching basketball.
Do you really think the majority of the Warriors fan base stuck around for 8 years? I have been seeing people wearing GS jerseys in Maine.
Do not start with that "2007" thing.
Low hanging fruit bro. If the Wizards ever make it to the top, I hope you welcome your bandwagon with open arms.
Yeah, if any of my six teams (DC and UVa) ever manage to win it all, I'll be too busy running down the street chugging every drop of liquor in existence.

OMFG FUCKING KEVIN THE SECOND HAS ONE NOW OMG. YOU SEE HIM PUT CURRY IN FUCKING PRISON OMFGGGGGGGGG
So the trend is this apparently:\n\n1.  Minnesota has an all-star or better player named Kevin.\n2.  After many years, Minnesota trades Kevin to another team.\n3.  Within 2 years, Kevin wins a title on his new team.\n\nDunno how I feel about this...
Karl *is* short for Kevin....as we all know. 
Fuck the clippers\n\nEdit: Sorry Clippers fans just had to let it out
Warriors losing in historical fashion? It might as well be Christmas.

Don't even care. Way too happy

Hey you leave us out of this, I'm just happy the Warriors lost. Also the land got theirs maybe we get one as a franchise. 
I just want to get into the fucking conference finals. 
God damn it...
oh look a little bit of sunshine in all of this...
Anyone but the clippers or boston winning is a little sunshine.
My body is ready.
The best team in the league pitted against the best player in the world... even if you're not a Warriors or Cavs fan, what a time to be a fan of the sport of basketball. Well played by both teams.
72-10 > 73-9
87-13 > 88-18
The Chicago Bulls previously had a record of 72 wins and 10 losses in the 95-96 season, and won the Finals to take home the ring.\n\nThe Golden State Warriors beat that record this season, having 73 wins and 9 losses, but just lost the Finals to the Cleveland Cavaliers.\n\n\nThe warriors might have had the best season of all time, but it don't mean a thing without the ring. \n
72-10 just has a better ring to it
Doesn't even compare man, that bulls team could destroy any team in history
people were already talking about the threepeat next year
Don't mean a thing without the ring
Ex bull players are going to talk so much shit

LOL\n\n
And 100% of Cavs fans experienced their first championship
LOL
COULDNT CARE LESS
50% is putting it nicely.
75% easily.
congrats cavs.  
You guys played amazing this series and delivered one of the greatest Game 7s I've ever seen. Much respect to Golden State. 
Can't be mad at the Cavs. And you know what they 100% deserved this win. \n\nIdk what our offense did for 3 minutes but it obviously wasn't enough to win this game. Fucking joke. But Cavs played good defense as well. Can't just pretend we lost this game. The Cavs won it 
Arrogant bullshit stylish playing cost them the game.\n\nCurry is arrogant as fuck, why the hell else would you do a behind the back pass, near out of bounds, in a Game 7 of the NBA finals?
Too many forced shots.  Also that clutch block by LeBron basically won them the game.  We really needed Bogut because Festus and Andy did not contribute to this game but the Cavs played well.  LeBron played great (as expected).  Kyrie had some crazy clutch shots and KLove actually showed up.
dont forget JR he saved the cavs imo in the beggining of the second half, he had like 8 or 11 points in a min which tied the game
JR SMITH FINALLY HAS A RING 
That natural high!
Before Carmelo!
I never though I would see those words. 
For all the shit he has gotten over the years, I'm super glad he won.  His tears at the end almost made my cry.  (as a Louisville / Chris Smith fan, I always dug JR)
I'm just proud of him for not getting kicked off the team

Lebron won the series. Kyrie won the game. 
In the same boat you could say without the block from Lebron Golden State could have won. It was a complete game by 2 amazing players.
Kyrie did a hell of a lot more than that 3. The man was phenomenal, especially in the last 3 games.
Almost everyone did exactly what their role is. Except Shump. I mean his 4 point play was huge but other than that, he played more than he should. Other than that everyone on the court had a hand in this win
If there was ever a team game, this was it, everyone played their role as needed.

I can't hate him. Dude went in front of all those people and congratulated him. Amazing sportsmanship after giving a hell of a performance. 
I saw that too, classy move.
So anybody up for some WNBA
I mean...that's pretty good money to play a game.
I hear they have better fundamentals than the NBA..

Kyrie was so much better than curry this series
A lot of players were better than Curry this series.
KYRIE CURRYS CURRY KLOVE LOCKS DOWN CURRY WTF IS THIS GAME??!??
Really weird. Thought I'd be way more upset - but seeing how much it means to LeBron, can't hate on that. What a legend, Kyrie just a freak also. Well done Cavs, you fucking earned that champ status. 
I'm with you man.  I've come to realize that myself.  Lebron gave his sweat blood and tears to bring a championship to Cleveland.  I'm happy for the Cavs.
I'm just here to shitpost 
Amazing CAVS THEY DID IT!
The last 5 minutes was just horrible offense by both teams. Save for the play that got Lebron his FT's to seal it.\n\nSeriously 54 seconds left, down 3. Cavs made 1 shot in last 2 minutes. Curry dribbles a full 23 seconds and takes the worst 3 I've ever seen. What's up with that? There was enough time to go for a 2, maybe call a timeout for a quick score.  \n\nWell deserved win for Cleveland
Steph Curry always plays really horrible offense he just makes a shit ton of awful shots 95% of the time. But when they\'re not going down you realize "wow this looks awful"
That's not true he may not be the best at spreading the ball around and playing the point guard position but he's great at getting himself space to make shots. And he's good at driving. He doesnt just stand there and chuck threes 
To be fair, Kevin Love played the best defensive possession of his life on that play
It was rugged on offense those last few minutes, but you might not be giving enough credit to the defenses. Guys were moving like mad, and there were no driving lanes at either end. Everyone seemed to be at a loss on how to get closer to the basket, and the difference in the game is one highly contested Kyrie 3 that happens to drop.\n\nProps to guys playing defense like everything was on the line. At least that's how I saw it.
I fully agree. He had Kevin Love all over him and he was fully guarding the 3 ball, Steph could have taken it to the hole all day, but Love stayed home and refused to bite on the fake (the fake being the crossover then fake drive to hit a stepback 3). Great defense by Love and a horrible decision by Curry. No need to play hero ball when you are on a team that won 73 games, and won by almost 30 without much help from you in game one. All of those weak side help blocks that LeBron had on him got in his head.
That last 4 minutes was the worst three chucking contest ever. The old timers would be rolling in their graves. I was fully expecting Curry to drive the basket for the 2 point lead. I mean sure his percentages overall say the three is better, but after not scoring for that long you just gotta make a bucket and get the lead.
Say whatever you want about a rigged system, the Warriors had plenty of chances to win tonight and didn't hit the shots.
73-9 ain't a thing without the ring
still 73-9 is an unbelievable record.  
Wait, who got 73-9 again? I already forgot. 
Doesn't have the same luster as the 72-10 season though.
That's because that was the best team in NBA history. 
Thank you, now every can shut up saying these guys would beat the bulls.  Have they seen Jordan in the playoffs?  Let me tell you, it isn't anything like watching Curry in the playoffs.
Such an entertaining season/playoffs/series.
Bring on the Jordan's

People will always be talking about Lebron, but Kyrie Irving is the one who really fucking stepped up and turned the heat on this series. Without him, this series would've ended in Game 5
I'd argue Lebron was the best offensive and defensive player this series.  It had to go to him.\n\nKyrie's G5 was incredible, perhaps the most efficient we've ever seen, but playoff Lebron is when his elite defense comes out.
>Kyrie should get FMVP\n\nNO
If only the last shot mattered then maybe. Lebron beat Irving in every stat up there in all three of these last 3 games. Irving had an amazing run, beat out only by the best player in the NBA.
It's not conforming to the narrative, he was easily the best player despite kyrie playing great ball.
Back to back 41 points and then only the 3rd ever triple double in a game 7 final (shout out to the Logo and Big Game James Worthy)\n\nTl;dr L+B+J = FMVP
The math checks out.
Why does it have to be one or the other they both stepped up hugely to get them the wins. 
Congratulations Golden State, \n\nYour **regular** season was one for the ages. You dominated all challenges and comers. You set all kind-of records that highlighted team excellence. Surely this will lead to a championship and a **historic** finish. \n\n*Signed*, \n\n'07 Patriots
This hurts to upvote.
I'm just happy we aren't alone anymore!
Very disappointing that their 73-9 season didn't end in a title
Disappointing to who? This is awesome as a Warriors hater
Disappointing to Warriors fans?  I mean, it's not that hard to think who would be disappointed by this if you remove your bias.
Shit I'm not even a Warriors fan and I'm disappointed. Obviously I'm happy Lebron won and the narrative is great and all, but I was pissed to see the 07 Patriots go down just like I'm pissed to see this. I like to see perfection, I like to see perfect games, I like to see records broken, I like to see the pinnacle of a sport. Who but haters wouldn't like that?\n\nSincerely congratulations to LBJ, the team, the organization and the city, but as an outsider I'd have been disappointed and elated for different reasons, if either team won this. That's part of what made this game so hype, so big, the narratives were compelling in both directions.
From what I've seen, the Warriors haters have been way worse than Warriors fans.
why do i have to be reminded of this

#It don't mean a thing without the ring
#95-96 BULLS BACK ON TOP
But now LeBron coming for MJ's throne
Yeah ok
Jordan never had to do that cause he had competent management that got him Scottie freaking Pippen whereas at first the best Cleveland could do was Mo Williams.\n\nJordan's supporting cast was just as good if not better than anything LeBron has had.\n\nLet's not forget Jordan's lack of team success until Pippen entered the equation.
Not until LeBron stretches out his arm from the half court line for a dunk will he even sniff at MJ.
It's plenty safe but you're right he's getting closer. 
Wooh!
Moral victory FTW!
I won't lie, as a Bulls fan I've spent over a decade rooting against LeBron, but that was just incredible. I was pulling for Cleveland. The city deserves it. Congrats Cavs fans, and thanks for knocking off the team that beat my Bulls' record.

The better player won
are you seriously suggesting steph curry is a better basketball player than lebron james?
Curry might have been injured too but LeBron was a fucking animal in the finals
Ya no way Curry is the better player. Lebron is the better overall athlete and defender. I don't see Curry making superman blocks on Lebron.
Best finals I've seen since I started watching nba, the cavs def are the better team I'm happy for them

Turns out Kyrie is pretty clutch, but Kevin Love's contribution to this better not get overlooked.
Seriously, 14 rebounds tonight, and he was fairly solid defensively throughout the series. 
I love Kyrie so much.\n\nLebron and his hand there got me worried
LeBron just raised his legacy to another level. Truly amazing to watch the Cavs will their way back from down 3-1. Congrats Cleveland and enjoy, this is what sports is all about.
Great game. Congrats to all the Cavs fans that have been waiting for this moment their whole lives. Yall deserve it big time. 
We saw it last year for the first time in 40 years last year, now they get it for the first time in 54 years and the first time ever at the same time, after watching Lebron come and go and come back to win one for the Land. Awesome to finish on a close game too!
My thoughts exactly. They've been through a lot over the last half century, and this was a very long time coming. I'm bummed that we lost, but I couldn't be happier for the Cavs and especially their fans. 
JR's postgame interview, man...the feels. Someone's gotta upload the full video, please. Lotta respect for that man.
LOL HELLA DODGED THE QUESTION 
doris asked the cavs owner on his thoughts about lebron leaving and returning to cleveland 
What the fuck? Dan Gilbert's kids tryna get a taste of the trophy LMAO get the fuck outta here and give that shit to King James
Big props to Draymond for being the first Warrior to congratulate Lebron. Big F'n props. That's their MVP. No doubt in my mind
Last time the city of Cleveland won a title was 1964, when LBJ was in office. Tonight, LBJ clinched the Cavaliers' victory. Illuminati confirmed
Kevin Love is undefeated as a NBA Champion.
No one going to comment on Adam Silver\'s jab at the Oracle arena fans?\n\n"You guys are a class act" -whilst whole arena booing. Sav.

Holy shit, 2000 comments, #1 /r/all in four minutes. Good shit, r/nba. \n\nLebron, you broke reddit, homie. 
Fantastic game regardless of who won
Cleveland. Cleveland won.
How do you blow a 3-1 lead in the finals after winning 73 games
Don't take the credit away from the Cavs
I'm a Bay Area fan, I love the trash that is the 49ers, I love the Giants and I love the Warriors. I'm so proud of what the Warriors did this season, especially Steph, Klay, Draymond and Iggy, but all I can say is Kyrie is something special and Lebron is a once in a lifetime player. I love Steph and I love my Warriors, but congrats to the Cavs and that was amazing basketball...good shit Cleveland.
Niners are the most successful team in the bay tho
They are, but I was born in 93 so I can't take too joy in our success and we are still a shit show! We hold season tickets and I'm a diehard fan, but lets call thew 49ers what they were this past season. Here's to hoping that Chip turns them into something special though!
That JR  Smith postgame interview was intense. 
As much as it hurts right now, I'll admit it: one MVP showed up and the other did not. I'm a fan of the Warriors, but a fan of the game too...and you cannot deny the play of LeBron. Congrats to Cleveland, they earned it. But Warriors will be back, and I expect them to compete just as hard if not harder for another ring!
Can we also talk about Timofey Mozgov? He was on the Cavs team last year when they were going by "Lebron & Friends" and had many great performances that helped them not get obliterated last season. This year he was def good enough to go and start for a lot of other teams but instead he stays with the Cavs and barely gets any game time at all. Is he mad though? Nope, he\'s the first one jumping off the bench to celebrate whenever his team scores. I\'m happy he got to be a part of this in some way.
I didn't [do too bad](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/4a4e0e/what_are_your_no_guts_no_glory_predictions_for/d0xgdgv). In fact, I fuckin' nailed it.

Kyrie won the game but that Lebron block probably saved their season

Fucking please. Those two were the only reason GSW were there in the first place after the bullshit Green got away with against OKC.
Yeah blame everyone but the players. Draymond Green being in didn't stop you from losing games 6 and 7
Go home. Accept your loss. People said all off season cavs fans made excuses about missing players. Everyone else can accept that the Warriors lost. Stfu. 
FEED ME YOUR TEARS
HOIST IT\n\nhttps://streamable.com/lqfz
I am so happy for CLE and for Lebron. Dude worked his ass off for this. Guess the haters can't say LOL 2 rings! Probably still say the refs rigged it though. Unbelievable victory.
I can't stop crying.  This is the best thing ever in my life.
If you watch closely at the end of Finding Dory, you can see all the bandwagon Warriors fans on that truck headed to Cleveland
THIS IS MY FAVORITE COMMENT AND IF I KNEW HOW TO GIVE GOLD I WOULD GIVE IT TO YOU
fucking golden
Well at least Curry can enjoy his free Doritos Locos Taco on Tuesday
I gained tremendous respect for Draymond when he waited for Bron to finish his interview before giving him a bear hug. I think he's the only Warrior I saw congratulating LeBron.\n\nCrazy considering the words he had for Bron a couple games ago. He's so easy to dislike but hard at the same time.
JR Smith is gonna make me fucking cry, you son of a bitch ;__;
The Warriors haven't lost three games in a row since June 19th
[Just saying](http://timtanhuynh.com/wp-content/uploads/72_10.jpg)
Ayesha Curry was spot on in her deleted tweet. The NBA is rigged. The problem is that the officials forgot to put the ball in the hoop for Steph today. 
Lebron's block on Iguodala may be one of the most defining plays in his career to me. Hopefully it isn't overlooked.

My goodness. KD TO WARRIORS
You shut your damn mouth
We'll take him if you want him back in a couple years for a chip.
JUMPSHOOTING TEAMS ERNEH
Just imagine ESPN tomorrow.  God help us non-Cleveland fans 
Bet the media won't even mention how hard Curry choked this series away 
Found out klay was wearing custom shoes "back to back" on them since game 5...\nAbit premature Klay...
LeBron finally did it. He won it for The Land. \n\nIt's so cool to see someone's greatest wish come true. Congratulations City of Cleveland. Y'all showed some serious heart. 
72-10 Bulls, still the greatest team ever
[yep](http://i.imgur.com/CLgeTAn.jpg)
Steph Curry was completely exposed these final three games. You cannot rely on a player whose only offensive ability is to shoot three pointers because it becomes extremely predictable. That last 5 minute stretch was Curry doing everything he could to try and get a three off. Just horrid offense from the "unanimous MVP."\n\nYou need to have more ways to create shots than running around screens and attempting step back 28 FT+ threes. In fact, Kyrie Irving vastly outplayed Curry this entire series, both offensively AND defensively, and it\'s only fitting he hits the huge dagger three over the heavily criticized defense of Curry.
What about when he erupted versus Portland?  Was that the same Curry or a different one?
You're the one making medical assessments that you have no idea about.  Curry himself said he was fine and that his injuries weren't a problem.  He just wasn't good enough.   That's all there is to it.  No need for injury excuses.  I'm sure Curry would say the same thing himself. 
here we go. "he was injured"
Seriously he did not use the excuse himself in the post game at all. He even said no surgeries planned. 
Nah, let\'s be real here. I strongly dislike Curry, but he\'s more than you\'re giving him. He\'s collapsing under pressure. He is one of the league\'s best finishers, an above average midrange shooter, and the best 3point shooter of all time. The issue with this is that when his threes don\'t fall, he loses confidence. And "shooters", even though they have other stellar abilities, literally cannot succeed without confidence. It was obvious he was doubting himself. \n\nWas he shit this series? Yeah. Is he maybe overrated a bit? Yeah. Is his only skill shooting 3s? Fuck no. 
Nah. Skill wise he is. Does he have the greatest career ever? No, that\'s Ray Allen. But you\'re telling me that the dude who makes 400 fucking 3s in a season-- 100 MORE THAN ANY OTHER PLAYER IN ANY OTHER SEASON-- at a ~45% clip isn\'t the best shooter of all time? No, he is, and talent wise that\'s a fact and its undebateable. His 402 this season is 116 more than the next best season; guess what? That next best season is his record too. Yes, Ray has the career record. So for the moment he is the "Greatest" shooter of all time. But if you don\'t think Steph is the "Best" shooter of all time then fuck outta here, cause a dude who has made 1.5 times as many 3s in a season as the next closest player (Klay Thompson) is the indisputable most talented shooter ever. 
Yeah he took a ton of credit for the loss post game. He definitely let it get to him and the pressure was huge on him to deliver as the de facto 'leader' of the team. \n\nEven Lebron acknowledged it's not easy to lead and be the calm person even when you don't feel calm yourself. Unbelievable to me that the cavs kept their composure so well when this is a few of their first times to the finals, and GSW literally were here last year. \n\nJust a masterpiece by the cavs. 
Although they lost, I gotta give respect to Harrison Barnes. After all the backlash for making 0 shots in games 5 and 6, he responded tonight by going 3-10. Props to him. 
Amazing.
Fuck Anderson Verejao 
This might be the most historic thing I've ever seen in my life. A 73-9 team winds up 88-18 and doesn't win the title. Cleveland - FUCKING CLEVELAND - gets a title and despite me generally not giving a fuck about them, I am inexplicably happy for them. They fucking earned this. LeBron just cemented his entire legacy as maybe the 4th or 5th best player ever, and he still has more titles to win for that city. What a night. \n
I think we can all say that LeBron is still the best player in the game.\n\nPeople will ask if he'll leave now that he brought the championship home, but I doubt he would after a win.
i give respect green for going out and taking time to congratulate the cavs. we can hate on him but you got to give respect to that.\n\n\nmeanwhile guess who was the first to go to the locker room? the same guy that said that its a mans game. smdh
What we learned from this series is, piss off LeBron James and you'll end up choking a 3-1 series lead.\n\nGreatest NBA playoffs of all time.

im in tears you guys. im so happy for lebron. for cleveland. great season. holy cow you guys. amazing.

Now the comparison to the '96 Bulls is a harder sell. I'm happy.
SUCK IT FIVETHIRYEIGHT 
lmao CSN Bay Area reporter: "Steph, what exactly contributed to you sucking so bad in the Finals?"
If I had the ability to have one super power I could use just once, it would be to Falcon Punch Stephen A. Smith directly in his useless fucking face. 
Holy shit JR is crying his eyes out right now
Klay walked right out without shaking hands. I gained tons of respect for Draymond tonight, but lost a ton for Klay. Shows what kind of a player he really is. He must've gotten his feelings hurt. Oh well, it's a man's league anyway. Go Cavs!
TIL\n\nPlayers with 3 championships, 3 Finals MVPs, 4 NBA MVPs:\n\n1. Michael Jordan \n\n2. LeBron James\n\nEnd of list.
To be fair to Bill Russell, the Finals MVP award didn't exist until 1968-69.
Major respect to Draymond and Steph for sticking around to shake hands.   Fuck Klay Thompson for running away to cry.
Finally, Space Jam 2 can have a good ending.
Draymond Green lost!!!! I'm so happy!!!
Nah, fuck Draymond. Him losing isn't my only source of happiness, but it's doing it for me right now
That's shitty. He was one of the few Warriors players to actually go up and hug and congratulate LeBron, if he's not salty why are you 
Probably because he's a dirty player
Karma is real. No nut kicking NBA champs
GS got what they deserved for what they did to my thunder! never been so happy for a team that wasnt my own
Draymond is the only warrior that wanted to repeat.
Yup. Gotta respect how hard he played tonight. He had an amazing game 
Proving its just ball by giving Lebron the congrats after. That's a huge thing in my opinion and much props to Green. It's hard to give congrats after being so close. 
I hate that guy but he played his ass off on both ends of the court and didn't get into anything at all. Respect for his game 7 performance at least 
He gave it his all tonight.
I'm legitimately emotional and happy for Lebron. 
YOU MOTHER FUCKERS GOT YOUR CLOSE GAME!!!
Before the game started I said that was all I wanted. About at the tip off I realised I actually didn't give a fuck and just wanted LeBron to win. How great is this.
That kid holding the trophy earlier was a disgrace. Get the fuck off the stage
Unanimous Finals MVP: Lebron James\n\nEat your heart out Steph

[Happy Fathers Day to MVP LeBron James!](http://i.imgur.com/wqFvpP8.jpg)
I've said it earlier these playoffs and I'll say it again. When the Warriors aren't hitting their crazy 3s they have almost nothing on offense and it showed tonight going scoreless for the final 4 mins. Give credit to the Cavs excellent defense they didn't give them any easy looks.
As a Bulls fan...now I know EXACTLY how 2007 was for Dolphins fans.
Fuck, JR...that was seriously amazing. All of a sudden my TV ain't HD anymore.
Varejao: "Yo where\'s my ring? Are you guys just gonna send it to me or what?"\n\nCavs: "*Read at 8:02pm*"
I'm so fucking amped still I can't sleep
Lue averages more than one championship per season coached.\n\nIt'll be difficult for him to keep that pace up.
What aggravates me is that if LeBron were to choke away a Finals Series after being up 3-1, everyone would be crushing him. Since it's Curry it's like we give him the benefit of the doubt.
That defensive possession by Love on Curry was fucking absurd. Holy fuck
Love proved his worth out there, got a key rebound, got the Kyrie pass after his awful transition layup attempt, and got the stop on curry.
It was Love earning his contract. Right there.
The 30 for 30 is gonna be sick. The story + beating the 73-9 defending champs.
So awesome seeing this!
Holy shit
Look, obviously I wanted a different result. This really hurts. But as someone who loves basketball and tries to be as fair as possible, this is the least mad I can be in a loss. \n\nI wanted the repeat. I did. But it's hard not to respect what this means to Cleveland, and what LeBron (and Kyrie) did to one of the 5 best teams ever. They lost for visible reasons, and the Cavs deserved this result. \n\nRespect. Party your asses off, Cleveland. You earned it.  
LEBRON FUCKING JAMES
Lebron earned it
I cant wait to see what Curry's dumb ass wife tweets out about this game. 
If you don't like that, you don't like NBA basketball. Fucking amazing
THE RESULTS ARE IN:\nGOLDEN STATE WARRIORS...YOU ARE...NOT THE GREATEST TEAM IN NBA HISTORY!!!!
Kyrie fucking Irving. So proud of the kid. Dude stepped up and didn't fold. 
NEXT TIME YOU CRITICIZE KYRIE AND LOVE, YOU BEST REFER TO THEM AS "KYRIE IRVING AND KEVIN LOVE, NBA CHAMPIONS!"
Kevin Love with the largest +/- of the game. That man showed up tonight.
Lebron's baby girl is too damn adorable! 
LeBron sounds so liberated in this presser. He has a totally different tone to his speech.
The Bulls's Record died for this
Charles Barkley - 1 \n\nJump Shooting Teams - 1
Probably an overstatement, but Steph Curry literally shit the bed. His performance in these Finals was nothing near of what you'd expect from a 2 time reigning MVP.
Unanimous hah
Kevin Love with the freaking Austin 3:16 shirt in his post game interview lol. I love this guy. 
This JR Smith press conference is intense 
Man, respect to JR. So happy for him.
I'll admit I used to think JR was a thug, but don't judge a book by its cover. That was real. 
It's finally next year 
Maybe Klay\'s "Man\'s League" is a secret club for people that disappear in close out games of NBA Finals \xf0\x9f\xa4\x94\xf0\x9f\xa4\x94\xf0\x9f\xa4\x94
But how are Klay's Feelings?
Isiah thomas just said that lebron is probably the best player in the history of our game 
73-9 AIN'T NO THING \n\nWITHOUT THE RING
test post, lemme see that trophy...
[MJ right now](http://www.memecreator.com/static/images/memes/316978.jpg)
There were a few Golden State fans that stayed after the buzzer and were applauding after the Cavs won, so shoutout to them. Whether they were applauding the Cavs win or the great GS season, that's really admirable.  
[Happy Father's Day Lebron!](http://imgur.com/WV4svPv)
[I told y'all](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/46wz7h/how_about_an_unpopular_opinion_thread_from_2/d08mn2r)
So amazing great for LeBron!!!
Klay is such a sore loser. \n\nSwallow your pride and congratulate the opposing team with the rest of your teammates, just like they did for you last year. Or is he not a grown man after all?
it's a mans league - Klay Thompson, leaving the court early twice in a row immediately after
I guess his feelings got hurt.
Imagine if LeBron had a 73 win team with a 3-1 finals lead and lost.
How are the boos towards Silver not louder? Oracle take this L
Had sex with my girlfriend during the game and cavs went on that 11-0 run during. I did my part for Cleveland lasting almost 2 minutes, you're welcome. All about that sports juju.

said this in the game thread, but:\n\ni've been rooting for the warriors for years. had a blast this season. gotta say, if this team had to lose in the finals, i'm glad it was on a performance like lebron's with all this at stake. trumping history with even more impressive history makes it go down a little easier. good hustle lebron and enjoy it, cleveland!
#**73-NEIN**
Did Ayesha delete her Twitter account yet?
Where were you when Curry is kill
LeBron: "they are the greatest regular season team... (and that\'s it)"
Trump should thank Curry for contributing all those bricks to the wall
The Warriors lost as any games in the playoffs (15-9) as they did in the regular season (73-9)... Unbelievable
Space Jam 2 is going to be so lit.
I just wanna say that JR Smith is an NBA Champion! Congrats, Go lay that pipe!
Wonder if Mark Jackson finds silent joy in the Warriors loss
Kevin Love +19
Kyrie Irving's clutch 3 will definitely go down in history as one of the greatest shots of all time
lebron just sold *half a million brake pads!!!*

Can someone please get the gif of love playing d on curry at the end of the game. That was so clutch and will probably get over looked
But can they beat Kentucky? 
LeBron calling out Jose Mesa damn...
kevin love with the austin 3:16 shirt LMAO
If LeBron finished that dunk there would be a new NBA logo
J.R. Smith with the heavy feels.
Damn JR being real. Making me emotional too. 
Kevin Love +19\n\nThis was his JD Drew game.
I know LeBron and Kyrie deserve most of the spotlight, but hot damn did Tristan Thompson do all the thankless things today. He played ball defense on Steph Curry many times and did better than can ever be expected of someone his size. He also got big boards and through them put some key fouls on the Warriors. Gotta appreciate hard work in the paint!
This moment will likely turn Anderson Varejao into a super villain like we've never seen.  
Best Regular season ever\n\nFirst unanimous MVP  \n\nFirst to ever lose the finals being up 3-1\n\nWarriors made history 
THE KING
What an awesome game
FOR THE LANDDDDDDD
Warriors just lost to a father of 3
For all the Warriors bandwagon who thought it was 100% over at 3-1, here is a new challenge for you, no team has come back being down 3-4.
The dream! 
96' bulls > 16' warriors 
Congratulations to the city of Cleveland. We in Philly know the feeling all too well.
I'm so happy for Lebron. The cavs outplayed us in every way and Cleveland deserves this win. Congrats man. 
ironic that a 3 in Curry's face won it...
MY FLAIR HAS A FUCKING TROPHY NEXT TO IT WHAT THE FUCK
As quickly as the Media loved Steph Curry and built him up the last two years, they\'re gonna tear him down.  It\'s going to be crazy to see, they did the same with LeBron with the "decision" and now Curry is going to get it, because of his performance this series and the "mouth guard gate".
Curry choked the whole series. I don't get it. Was Cleveland just the better team last year, except got crippled by injuries?
I'm actually worried about the state of the city of Cleveland and what will be left by tomorrow....
And highest +/- of game 7 goes to... KEVIN LOVE!!!
Mavs fan checking in.. feels pretty good when your team goes up against a hyped Goliath team and wins. It feels really good. With the Cavs down 3-1 this has just go to be even sweeter for their fans. Congrats Cleveland!
Has there been an update on Lebrons wrist? \n\nThat thing flopped so much I thought it was Varejao.
haha Kevin Love with the Austin 3:16 shirt!
 http://i.imgur.com/JETpmAn.jpg 
Pretty powerful presser with JR. You go dude. Fuck all of the naysayers. You did it. 
Each of the big three had their significant moment at the end of the game.\n\nLeBron had one of the greatest blocks ever, and hit the free throw to take the lead to 4.\n\nKyrie hit a shot that will live forever.\n\nKevin Love was switched on Steph Curry and played phenomenal defense to shut him down.
Somebody tell me the West is stacked and the East ain't shit.
I still can't stand Draymond Green but respect to him for congratulating LeBron like that. I wasn't expecting that.
I think we can all safely agree this was the defining moment of LeBron's career.
Great game honestly , one of the most stressful I've watched for sure. Lebron James played incredible tonight , and the block on Iggy with 1minute left left me speechless , like how are you even that clutch? Irving 3 pointer on Curry , man so many great things. Incredible end to an already incredible season.
Mini back door sweep. Believeland.
Did anybody else get caught off-guard by J.R Smith crying at the end? I kind of feel bad for making fun of him now. Props to him for respecting his parents and playing through the haters.
I didn't know my shirt was made out of onions until he started that interview 
Golden State Warriors 9 losses in the regular season... 9 losses in the playoffs. 
I turned on ESPN for fun just now, and sure enough there is Skip Bayless arguing that Kyrie Irving should have received the Finals MVP award over Lebron.  What a troll.
Congrats to Cleveland. This would hurt a lot more if we hadn't won last year, but you can't expect to get it every season. Cavs played well. Irving stepped up and Lebron was a monster. 
Great game by both teams. We choked and the cavs deserved it.
Yea, I agree. I have no excuses or whines. Klay and Steph missed looks that they had been making all season. The only guy who really put his stamp on this game was Draymond and it just wasn't enough. Iggy was clutch on D, but those free throws....ugh. 
Well the good news is that when the East wins, the Democrats win the presidential election.
Fuck. So salty right now but this made me feel better\n\nLose the battle, win the war I guess
FUCK\n\nDRAYMOND\n\nGREEN
These comments are going so fast no one will ever notice that I sleep with a giant stuffed Pikachu.
Get those kids off the damn stage! They didnt do shit to win the championship 
I'm so happy for so many reasons.\n\n* I'm happy Lebron finally brought a championship to Cleveland.\n* I'm happy Love got a ring.\n* I'm happy Kyrie got a ring.\n* I'm happy TT got a ring.\n* I'm happy Delly got a ring.\n* I'm happy Draymond lost.
The icing on the cake at least for this fan is that Draymond Green played his heart out, showed the fuck up in this game 7 and STILL lost.  Love it.
Lebron James biggest babyface comeback ever
This goes to shut up Curry's wife and any conspiracy believer. 
i really lost respect for klay this series. Making the comments about how it's a man's league, then not even sticking around to congratulate your opponent. Wow. at least draymond stuck around.
Its a mans league bitches about Mozgovs screen
Curry choked.
I was at a bar and my friends at home won't confirm:  Did Klove successfully defend curry on the 2nd to last warriors possession?  Big if true.
Why the hell does Doris Burk get to be there over Craig Sager?
I couldn\'t hear you Doris\n\nGilbert is so full of it
Why are these kids up there
Wasn't Bill Russell supposed to present it? Why is he even there if he's not?
Lue was born in Mexico, Missouri, just in case anyone else was wondering about those shout outs. Not sure if there is any backstory beyond that
Lebron has solidified his place in NBA Greatest players to ever play the game at #2 All-time behind MJ
I haven't seen anyone hold the Finals trophy since LeBron took it. He's gonna kick Savannah out of bed and sleep with the trophy tonight. The King is back!!!! 
[Meanwhile in Cleveland](https://twitter.com/ByCasagrande/status/744725946247221249)
This dude on ESPN legit just said that there are reports of a fire truck being stolen LMAO. 
at the end of the day  x175 
Damn that JR post game . The feels!
I've been a Cleveland sports fan for the short 19 years of my life and I couldn't even picture this happening earlier today. I could only imagine what the players are feeling right now.
Does anyone happen to have Varejao flopping twice when he was defending Kevin Love? that had me in stitches man...
I was happy for LeBron since he delivered on his promise to win for Cleveland. At the same time, watching Curry and Thompson only hitting 25% on three-pointers in game 7 was gratifying in a Schadenfreude kind of way.

Savage
Ain't a thing without that ring
[removed]
Holy fuck, NSFW 
For the Land
73 wins and no championship. Well that's embarrassing...
This has to solidify the career of James, I mean 3 rings 6 straight finals, James Jones is truly the GOAT.
#73 AND NO
This is gonna get buried, but just wanted to see my trophy flair! Woot Woot!
73 AND NEIN!!!
FUCK THE WARRIORS
lmao better buy your Lebron jersey for next season mate ;)
WE FUCKING DID IT!!!
FUCK DRAYMOND!!!
#FUCK DRAYMOND GREEN
Literally fuck the Warriors, fuck curry, fuck Ayesha, fuck Draymond, fuck their fans (I can hear them booing over the trophy ceremony)\n\nI've been watching the NBA for 10+ years and I've never hated a team, but I only wish bad things on the Warriors. What a story for Lebron to win one for the land. Can't make this shit up.
Kerr lost dubs the game by playing ezeli too much
**73 wins without a ring is nothing.**
**CASUALS HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED FROM THE /R/NBA CONTENTION**
FUCK YOUR 73-9 SEASON FUCK YOUR UNANIMOUS MVP!!!! FOR THE LAND!!!!!
The booing is frankly distasteful 
A Cleveland team won a championship. What a time to be alive.
Well at least we don't have to hear about the warriors being better than the 96 Bulls. Way to choke it away guys.
I'm not even mad. Congrats to Cleveland. And an even bigger congratulations to my Golden State Warriors. The things this organization and team have accomplished over the past few years, have truly transcended basketball. It would of been nice to win it all again, and we had a lot of opportunities to close it out, but it just wasn't meant to be. The journey has been truly amazing to be a part of. Thank you DubNation!\n
There\'s a weird thing next to my username.  \n  \nAnd before anyone says "act like you\'ve been there before," we haven\'t, so fuck yourselves.
LeBron is one of the greatest no questions asked just Witness.
Pretty safe to say warriors get an asterisk last year for beating zero healthy teams. 
#Best player of all time. \n\nNo meme. No joke. Greatness.
Jordan never won a championship for Cleveland 
Who is downvoting all these comments. Jordan is literally untouchable with his accolades. Its not even a knock to Lebron.
73-9 ain't a thing without a ring
The band wagon is dead!!!!!!!!
Is Lebron leaving Cleveland now???
73-9 is pretty good, but 72-10 has a better 'ring' to it.
DANK MEMES CAN'T MELT PLAYOFF DREAMS
Kyrie deserves the mvp.  He was there offense all series. 
Jokes on you Cleveland. You still have to live in Cleveland.
Have u been here? It's fucking awesome
Cleveland is pretty great.
Classic Celtics fan. \n\nHave you been to Cleveland? 
Seriously though, has anyone ever said, damn, I should take a vacation to Cleveland .
Noah what you doing on reddit?
Typical MAsshole
Yeah! F Cleveland! You guys suck with your dirt cheap cost of living and lucrative job market! oh wait shit... no one is supposed to know about that. Yeah F Cleveland!!! Were... not... Detroit....
Fuck you, this city is AWESOME.
you ever been to CLE?
I personally love living here.
Joke's on you. We like it here.
Shhhh. Don't let them know we are happy day to day. They'll ruin it here 
Fresh joke
Joke's so old, it remembers the Browns winning in '64.
There gonna be nothing left. We're burning the whole thing down and building metropolis in its wake.
You hear that? ... Thats all the Warriors fans becoming Lakers fans again 
We probably will never see a team make a 3-1 finals game 7 win comeback ever again. What a game, this one is one to remember forever. The last time the finals were won on the road in game 7, the Wizards were the Baltimore Bullets and Wes Unsled was mvp.
We just witnessed the greatest game ever played within the greatest series ever played.\n\nYou did it, LeBron. You got one for The Land.
Eastern Conference Wins. That means the Democrats win the election!
He asked for his wife once he got off the floor crying. She doesn't seek attention.
So Lebron is now 3-4 at 31 years old and hasn't really showed any sign of slowing down. With Kyrie developing into a superstar I don't think 5 or maybe even 6 rings is out of reach for Lebron
I'm so drunk. I'm so crying
All y'all Lebron haters can SHUT THE FUCK UP NOW!!!!! 
Yeah, even without lebron the cavs would have won it because Kyrie won it by himself \n\n*Eyeroll*
if Lebron wouldn't have made that block happen, the Warriors would win the championship.
So that happened
Warrior fans salty as fuck. Still booing Silver as he tells them they're a class act. Show some fucking class damn.
For the last time this season: \n\nFUCK DRAYMOND GREEN 
#FUCK DRAYMOND GREEN
I am on my couch speechless and in near tears. 31 years of my life and a championship for Cleveland.  FUCKING YES
CURRY A BITCH
I don't think there's any doubt as to who the best player in the league is at this point.  I wonder though, in terms of ranking the NBA players, where does Stephen Curry fall now?  He was outplayed in both the CLE and OKC series by the opposing PG, and in my opinion it was his defense that was constantly exposed in the final 3 games of the CLE series that ultimately allowed CLE to win the title.  CLE kept going to the pick and roll to get Curry in the action, and more times than not, he was unable to stop either Irving or Lebron.  I don't think any other top player in the league would have that much trouble defending both a PG and a SF.  Heck, even Tristan Thompson, a Center, did a MUCH better job on a top PG than Curry did. \n\nI might be overreacting a bit, but at this point my personal NBA player rankings go:\n\n1.  Lebron James\n\n2.  Kevin Durant\n\n3.  Kawhi Leonard\n\n4.  Russell Westbrook\n\n5. Anthony Davis\n\n6. Stephen Curry\n\nThat honestly might still be too high for Curry...\n\n
Hahahahahaha  fuck curry fuck clay fuck Drayton and most importantly fuck all you bandwagoning  warriors fans. 
get fucked you piece of shit warriors bandwdagoners. im so happy about this outcome. so fucking happy. get fucked.
I don't care what anyone says. Lebron is the greatest of all time. Jordan never carried a team through a 3-1 deficit in the finals. 
FUCK DRAYMOND GREEN, SWEET KARMA FOR HIS CHEAP SHOTTING DONKEY ASS
LOL. Fuck you Golden State. Fuck you Steph Curry. And fuck everyone that loves Steph. 
The sorry ass Warriors fans are all booing the commissioner. Stay classy bandwagon fans.\n\nHistory was made with the Cleveland Cavaliers, not the Warriors. 73-9 with an easy schedule don't mean a thing without a ring.\n\n#Fuck The Warriors
I agree with everything else but easy schedule? Bro, it's the NBA, not the NFL
Lebron is top 5 People. Best athlete i've ever seen on a basketball court.
I was born and raised in CLE. Means a lot to me. Thanks team. 
Klay walking off without congratulationing the Cavs, at least Curry and Draymond did. Made bitch. 
Best regular season ever\n\nFirst unanimous MVP\n\nAnd of course being from the west. \n\nUp on a weak east team 3-1 with the hardest place to win home court advantage \n\nAll the odds in their favor even history is on their side\n\nAnd the Cavs pull off the impossible. The historic finals victory with the true MVP. \n\nDamn finally we get to see a Cleveland team bring it home. \n\nI guess a health Kyrie and love made a difference. I wonder what last year would have looked like with them healthy. No need to wonder anymore. 
Man, I should be fucking angry right now. But for whatever reason, I can't help but feeling happy for LeBron. They fought their way back down from 3-1, and came out and played their hearts out. I have nothing but respect for the Cavaliers. I hate that my Warriors will be shitted on for the next year or so, but fuck it. We went 73-9 and Stephen Curry was the unanimous MVP. I'm just happy that we are all witnessing great things happen, this has to be one of the greatest Playoffs and Seasons of all time. 
Ok Ayesha. Also, was the NBA rigged when they didn't suspend Draymond vs OKC? 
Why are these little kids on the fucking stage it's really pissing me off 
**WE FUCKING FINALLY DID IT. WE. FUCKING. WON. SOME PEOPLE JUST HIJACKED A FIRE TRUCK DOWNTOWN. WE DESERVE THIS. LOVE EVERY ONE OF YOU, EVEN THE BANDWAGON FANS. LOVE THE SPORT AND ALL THE FANS EVERYWHERE. EVEN THE WARRIORS FANS. CANT WAIT FOR THE NEXT SEASON TO START, BUT UNTIL THEN... WE'RE FUCKING #1**

GREATEST FINALS GAME OF ALL TIME 
#2.
- They let Barnes know the day and time of game 7
I work in downtown Cleveland.  I parked about 6 short blocks away from my job, because our private parking lot was still chained off from the night before and the attendant had\'t arrived to work yet. \n\nOn my walk in, I passed several bleary eyed party people trudging back to their cars that were parked in the same lot I parked in.  \n\nOne girl, her hair slightly mussed, wearing a Cavs jersey, was walking slowly carrying a few pillows with her boyfriend in tow.  He was carrying an air mattress, deflated in the carrying bag (I recognized it because I have the same one).  A few paces behind him strode his friend, wearing sunglasses, looking at the ground and carrying blankets.  \n\nI crossed the street heading to my job and passing by the main party street where all the bars are and  deftly dodged all the crushed beer cans but accidentally stepped on the broken neck of a glass beer bottle crushing it underfoot. Confetti and cigarette butts litter the streets.  I\'ve never seen so many cigarette butts before.  It\'s like a cigarette ouroboros in the sidewalk cracks. The dumpsters in the alleys behind the bars are overstuffed with garbage bags, still leaking beer cans/bottles.  There is a small corner that is created on the side of a building where the exit of a parking garage is sticking out.  In the corner there is still a 6-can-beer-pyramid stack still standing.  In the corner right above the beer pyramid there is a large stain on the wall.  It could be either vomit or urine.  I\'m not getting close enough to check. A bug lands on my face.  I brush it off.  The street sweepers, both human and machine are out in full force.  One street crew greets me with a "Good Morning! Great Game last night!"  I nod, smile and and agree with a, "It sure was..."\n\nContinuing my odyssey, a few young women emerged from their apartment complexes, yawning and still rubbing their eyes, wearing Cavs jerseys and/or t-shirts.  Some checked the parking meter and some stood there blankly for a few seconds before acknowledging my masculinity and then making their way to the bus stop.  \n\nIt is a warm but quiet morning in downtown Cleveland.  There is a cool breeze coming off the lake and the only sounds I can really hear is the lull of traffic and the construction crews laying the fiber optic cable for the RNC under the sidewalk. 
He wants his boys to attend the same high school that he did in Akron, he isn't going anywhere.
James isn't better than me but he's right there.
I get you're a dubs fan, but calling them likable is complete homerism. Steph and Klay acted entitled to the championship the entire series, and Green is a legit dirty playing asshole. 
How is he not top 3 at this point? 
i fucked her too bro chill
If you discredit their win last season you have to discredit the Cavs this year after the Warrior lost Bogut and had a hobbled Iggy.\n\nIt's unfair to discredit anyone's championship win given how much randomness is involved year in and year out.
You say you lost fair and square to a good team, but that first paragraph really makes it seem like you don't want to give the Cavs any credit.
Joke of a basketball team? Come on man.
What!?!?! Yes he did you moron.
Pretty sure curry stayed on the court to congratulate LeBron personally
Well he grew up here, his dad played for the Hornets and he went to Davidson so it does make sense. Why wouldn't he be a fan?
73 and nein
Come on man. LeBron may have had the best finals in history 
What a sad person you must be.
What a snobby piece of shit thing to say!
What a sad person you must be.
We here. Yawp. They not. Nope. Warriors suck. Yawp. GTFO. Yawp.
Umm... Oakland 
The best team wouldn't lose three games in a row. 
whatever you say, Ayesha Curry 
Do the names John Paxon and Steve Kerr ring any bells?
Oh get out of here. Horry and Fisher hit multiple clutch shots for Kobe and no one says he was 'lucky' to play with them.
See that trophy next to my flair? I'm the captain now
Lol, losing with grace I see.
Lmao
SALTY
