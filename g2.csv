When your second best player in a Finals game is Richard Jefferson, you're gonna have a bad time|[CHA] Kemba Walker|2839
b..but Cavs fans told me that with healthy Kyrie and Love, they would be the second and third best players?\n\nwhats funny is that one can make the argument that this years Warriors are less healthy than the Cavs, Curry had a MCL sprain not too long ago, and also less rested than the Cavs. If the Cavs lose this series with a healthy Kyrie (they should feel blessed as Kyrie is never healthy), its a fucking joke. Enough with the excuses. |Lakers|872
The difference between this big three and the old Heats are huge.  I mean Wayne and Bosh might have bad games; however, what the hell?!  Richard Jefferson and JR Smith needs to step it up.||1
Shut up man. It not as far fetched as it seems believe it or not. It\'s a seven game series and they\'re down 2-0 heading home. It\'s likely they win the next two and boom people like you are all back to saying "I told you so! Kyrie and Love are healthy this time around it\'s different!" |Rockets|1
To be fair the Warriors this year are unreal, and somehow much improved from last year. Anytime you face a team that is 73-9 with a unanimous MVP and another top MVP candidate it's going to be a tough road ahead.|Bucks|1
If my Facebook feed is any indication. All Cleveland fans are going into .... Wait remaining in "we will never win a series" mode. And actually not blaming anything. ||1
Did Love come back into the game? I heard he was held out due to concussion protocol.|Wizards|1
But.. but LeBron didn't have any help\xf0\x9f\x98\xa2|Lakers|1
Well Kevin Love is hurt now, so get ready for this team healthy hasn't lost a series. lawlz|Lakers|1
But JR got court burn and dirty Barnes knocked out Love. \n|Warriors|1
Maybe the warriors are just better?|76ers|1
If they lose,  maybe the Stephen A Smith prediction of Kyrie being traded and Chris Paul joining LeBron will really happen. ||1
Why is it funny that the Cavs are healthier than the Warriors? |Cavaliers|1
Dont forget igoudalas nuts. They were also a casualty|Cavaliers Bandwagon|1
>MCL sprain\n\nTrail of tears |[GSW] Stephen Curry|1
Yep. Enough excuses.|Cavaliers|2
The Cavs waterboys weren't healthy. Fluke by GSW||2
"It\'s going to be completely different!" Sure is. ||2
Because everyone can know they're gonna implode.|Celtics|2
lol|Supersonics|3
I mean, would you not have said the same thing before we witnessed them shit the bed?|Cavaliers|69
Shooting lights out from 3 against Detroit and Boston isn't a very good measurement when going up against GS.|Raptors|-1
I liked how you left your own team out. And I never said that because of how we were shooting, I'm saying was it really all that unreasonable to think that having Love and Irving would bring a better result than what we got last year?|Cavaliers|6
Golden State was very good last year, but do people actually think that they aren't definitively better this year? You could easily make the argument that Klay, Curry, Draymond, and many others have all improved their games since last season. I picked the Warriors in four games this year, and I don't think it's completely outlandish to think that the Cavs would have had a decent shot last year if healthy.||1
I absolutely agree. But toward the end of the season/beginning of playoffs it looked like we had finally figured it out, and it looked like we got better as well. I'm not discrediting GS at all, we got our asses kicked, I just hate that r/nba is trying to make us look cocky, as if we were saying it was gonna be no contest with both Irving and Love. A lot of us had his series being a tough fight but not a whole lot of us felt easy at all with another matchup with the dubs |Cavaliers|4
I'm a Cavs fan, too. Nobody I know even thought we were the favorites in this series. We were just cautiously hopeful that things might be better this time. This image of cocky Cavs fans talking shit about having Kyrie and Love is ridiculous. ||2
Exactly. The cocky ones are usually the obvious bandwagoners. I've watched Cleveland sports for too long to be cocky about ANY upcoming matchup.|Cavaliers|1
No it isn't man, just ignore them. Of course you expect a team to play better with the second and third best players actually playing.\n\nI guess having Irving and Love in you guys just give up too much defensively then with Delly and TT|Lakers|5
Exactly. I suspect last year was a little bit of Ewing effect with the other players as well. But you're right, it's either more defense or offense and we gotta pick one. Because we're getting our asses kicked until we do |Cavaliers|2
Yeah, you guys give up a lot defensively by having Love and Irving on the floor but when they're also doing shit all on offense it absolutely kills you guys. \n\nUnless Love and Irving start to fire Lue has to make a choice, cause this just isn't working|Lakers|2
Left them out because the crazy 3 point barrage slowed down a little against the Raps. It was on full display the first 2 rounds. Maybe I'm mistaken though, lol.|Raptors|3
No you're right, i didn't read your original comment correctly, I didn't see you put from 3 haha. I thought you meant just general performance |Cavaliers|3
No. As some of us said way back last year, losing love and Irving were a blessing. Can't beat the warriors with them. Need to go defense and rebounding.||1
Yes but the key word there is SOME people said that. The general consensus at the time was that maybe if we had Irving and Love the series would have turned out differently. Although we've sacrificed defense playing these too, on paper Love is a great rebounder so was never a foolish idea to think we'd be better. We're getting outplayed and outcoached simple as that. |Cavaliers|2
General consensus doesn\'t equal "correct".\n\nYou\'ll never beat the warriors with those two as main players. Neither are as good as a complete player as Igudola, and he\'s GS\'s 4th best player. Hell, In not sure I\'d take either of them over Barnes.||-1
Lmao okay, this takes the cake, I know we just got our asses kicked but you're fucking high if you think Harrison Barnes is a better player than either of those two. |Cavaliers|2
What you think about that goes a long way to how you think about basketball. \n\nI said possibly. It's close. He's a much better defender than either one. They're better offensive players. Probably comes down to fit and role on who I'd prefer. \n\nThis ain't NBA2k||1
Dude those people just trolling, ignore em|Warriors|67
It's just typical smug  warriors fans.\n\nNot saying all are, but there are a lot of them.|[MIN] Andrew Wiggins|0

>Through the finals. |[NYK] Langston Galloway|1
Actually some people said the composition of the team without Love and Irving was a better matchup for the cavs.. ||18
some people =/= all cavs fans|Cavaliers|1
Huh? The point was that people foresaw match up issues with Kyrie and Love on the roster. You didn't need to see them shit the bed to know they match up poorly with the dubs, and that they wouldn't be the second and third best player. ||6
Sorry, I thought you were adding on to the OP basically generalizing all Cavs fans thinking this would be easy with both Love and Irving. Obviously something has to give, either defense or offense and while I agree with your viewpoint, hindsight is 20/20. Last year we had the defense and no scoring, this year we have neither, but many of us thought that with the way our offense had been performing we could possibly outgun them. Obviously we're wrong so far. |Cavaliers|2
tbf it was a completely reasonable thing to say.|Bulls|253
I said all off season that it was joke that people thought the Cavs would win with kyrie and love. Their defense is God awful and the pace would have been quicker which only helps the warriors. Games 2 and 3 were slow ugly games that curry played God awful in. That is why they lost. Not because LeBron willed the Cavs to win. LeBron may have had a part to do with it but I don't care what any of you say scoring 40 on a eFG% below .400 is not expressive |[GSW] Tim Hardaway|1
And it wasn't just Cavs fans saying it either. Heck I said it.|Thunder|9
It's reasonable unless you thought the Cavs would have won last year with both. The NBA is about match ups and the Cavs personnel just matchup awfully with the Warriors.|Raptors|12
A bunch of people, myself included, were getting roasted after the games last year when we said Kyrie and Love would make the defense significantly worse to the point that the Dubs would be getting insanely easy shots. Last year's LeBrons took the Dubs to six games, but they couldn't have done it without the defense, which is clearly sorely missed in these finals. |Knicks|2
And the only reason it went 6 last year was because it took the Warriors three games to figure out that going small against the Cavs would murder them (hence winning the last three games easily). |Raptors|1
I got nothing but down votes for saying kyrie and Love's defense and increase in pace would have only hurt the Cavs last season. Fuck /r/NBA for saying we got lucky last year. |[GSW] Tim Hardaway|1
A number of GS assistant coaches (according to Zach Lowe) were actually upset when Love and Kyrie went down, because they were looking forward to matching up against them. They thought that the Cav's defensive lineups were a bigger concern, and so far that appears to be true.|Lakers|20
Yeah hindsight is 20/20. I mean I was pretty worried about this game, even going into the half.|Warriors|35
[deleted]||-5
Well now that seems obvious, but don't forget the Cavs were up 7 at one point.|Warriors|17
It seemed obvious the second you watched them play last year with a more defensive line up involving a better Mozgov and Tristan Thompson, a little more similar to the Thunder match up, but with only 1 superstar, which inevitably cracked and couldn't hold back the Warriors.  Then you look at the games where the 2 other stars play vs the Warriors and basically they get scored on all game and the Warriors blow out the Cavs.  I picked the Warriors to win in 7 on account of LeBron being LeBron, he brought them to 6 with a shittier team all the same regardless of how bad Kyrie's defense is, but the bench is wrecking Kyrie even harder than I ever expected.  He's less than invisible, he's like a buffet and anyone with a pair of eyes on the man on Kyrie is basically serving dinner.  Barbosa and Livingston and Iguodala just do whatever they want, and any time Draymond touches the ball when Kyrie's in the game it's usually 1 or 2 passes before Kyrie gets posted up on or hit with a screen or caught losing his man.  Kyrie made no 3s, shot horribly, and was the worst in +/-.  That's embarrassing and I honestly see it getting worse until they just reduce his minutes entirely.|Heat|3
Maaaan, that shit was a whole 2 hours ago. Ancient history. They're straight ass now. |Spurs|6
And that lineups with Channing Frye would allow them to out shoot the Warriors.|Kings|425
what are you talking about.\n\nFrye played 7 minutes in Game 1 and 3 minutes in Game 2\n\nDon't talk like the Warriors have beaten the Cavs from deep, when the Cavs haven't used that lineup to try to play that way. Why are you getting upvoted||-5
...there's a pretty obvious reason why they haven't dared to try it yet.|[GSW] Gilbert Arenas|1
Hahahahahahaha||1
>with Channing Frye would allow them to out shoot the Warriors.\n\nYou can't fight fire with a cardboard box|Raptors|1
amazing how Channing Frye's 3 point shooting has been zero factor so far. \nWarriors defence ain't no joke. Warriors came prepared for that bench lineup such that Lue is now too shook to play it.|Warriors|5
He hasn't played though|76ers|2
to be fair, he has not gotten much of an attempt to make an impact. 10 total minutes played in the last two games, 2 FGA total.||4
Ayyyy lmao|Supersonics|3
I was hoping that would be true come this matchup but any person rooting for the cavs is delusional if they thought frye would be as open and as on as he was in the eastern playoffs |Pelicans|3
They forgot to mention how that only works against eastern conference caliber teams|Knicks|242
Hence Phil Jackson staying in NY. He wants no part of the western conference. |Knicks|3

Ayyyy f u|Raptors|41
Knicks are in the East too, he knows the struggle. \n\nI hope in the next few years the East will develop enough new blood to be competitive.|Warriors|10
We can see it trending in that direction (the 8th seed almost had a losing record in the west compared to being a 45-50 win team the past few years). They still have a while until they work up the deep playoff teams of the West.|Spurs|1
> out shoot the Warriors.\n\n...||183
That's what they said, believe it or not|Warriors|1
Yup\n\nComments and comments of saying that the Warriors would get their buckets but the lineup would just score more than them.\n\nLike people saying the lineup is better offensively than the Warriors death lineup|Kings|5
People actually said that? Lol I'm sorry but I can't believe that|Heat|6
They saw the one stat that said the Cavs have been making more 3s per game in the playoffs against ECF teams and there you go|Warriors|10
That's stupid and largely a result of bad defense on the other team.  People should understand context better so they won't be disappointed by reality.|Heat|1
because they beat the corpse of an Atlanta team and happened to catch fire at the same time?\n\nwtf were some people smoking?|Lakers|9
There were people during the Hawks-Cavs series that were all like "There is no team in the league that can catch fire like the Cavs" and they were taken seriously. Thats what you need to know|Bulls|8
You have got to stop listening to Stephen A. Smith.|Celtics|1
man the Cavs catching fire still doesn't even come close to if Klay or Steph catch fire.\n\ni guess people just really wanted the Cavs to be good enough to challenge even a little bit.|Lakers|6
Delusion hits people in many ways. Let's try not to reason with madness. |Warriors|18

Yup.   Everyone knew the western conference finals were actually the finals.   We tried convincing ourself differently since the cavs ran through the east in the playoffs.  This was the outcome everyone knew 6 months ago.   The west would fight tooth and nai and the cavs would run the east.  then after a hard fought west, the Warriors would finish it out and steamroll the east. \n\nThe playoffs were so good in the West that we thought it could be different.

Just curious, why are people watching pirate streams for a game that's totally free for everybody? ABC is an OTA channel.||2
Just my guess, but people out of the US. Or folks who only pay Internet without cable.|[GSW] Klay Thompson|1
You don't need cable to get ABC. It is 100% free over-the-air (OTA). All you need is an antenna which you can snag for ~$25.\n\nOutside of the US makes sense. I don't believe ABC steams games themselves (yet).||0
I meant "cable" being that you order a package option from your network provider. I probably should\'ve clarified that more. However if you\'re making a decision to buy an external antenna for a archaic TV rather than just clicking on a perfectly great stream that you can watch on high res computer screens (mobile platforms) then that logic my friend is something I can\'t help people with.|[GSW] Klay Thompson|0
No, I understand what you meant - having channels delivered to you by a telecom company. OTA is definitely not that. I think it\'s funny that some people still consider the free broadcasts to be "archaic" when [OTA quality is actually higher than that of cable/satellite](https://www.groundedreason.com/broadcast-tv-is-not-only-free-its-better/). \n\n>When compressing the signal, not all of the original data representing the TV show is preserved. The higher the level of compression, the more data is lost. The result is the picture on your TV  losing sharpness and detail.\n\n>While over the air broadcast TV also uses digital compression, there are far less channels in the broadcast TV signal compared to cable TV. As a result, less data is lost, and the picture looks clean and sharp by comparison.\n\n>This is obvious when watching an NFL game received from an antenna, next to a one being watched on cable TV. Both are in HDTV, but the game being received from the TV antenna is in a completely different class when it comes to a quality picture.||0
Going back to your original question. And focusing solely on that. People stream out of pure convenience and because it's available here on r/nba. The game is what is important and not worrying too much about which source it's coming from, just as long as it's of decent quality. Good facts about OTA quality. But I don't believe that was the point.|[GSW] Klay Thompson|0

He's got some nice song choices too. Wonder if he puts his playlist out there somewhere? Shame he won't be streaming game 3 because of his finals. Now I have to settle on a worse stream.||42
He won't be streaming game 3?? That sucks.. I've always been watching his streams, works perfectly on my phone|Cavaliers Bandwagon|3
He usually has a link to the Spotify playlist before the game starts|Heat|8
https://play.spotify.com/user/handrewbrozel/playlist/0a5u7vA0kjznaAAWmqcW7J\n\nIt's pretty great! He knows how to mix a playlist to keep (most) people happy with the song choice. I hope /u/handrewbrozel doesn't mind me sharing it here.|Warriors|44
Cool |Pelicans|2
Most of the time its just on shuffle haha, but thanks, glad you like it.|Warriors|78

Isn't ABC free for everyone? Don't u just need an Antenna? |Lakers|1
Hahah is there a VOD of this stream? You sound more entertaining than the fourth quarter of this game|Warriors Bandwagon|3
what's up man. Just wanted to say, you got me through watching the Finals last year as I graduated college and entered the real world. Now I don't need the stream anymore, got me a nice job and a good cable package. I'm not living in lavish luxury, but my girl and I do okay. You have a patreon or anything set up? I'd toss you 10-20$ to keep the lights on.||11

lol|Celtics|1
Dude, i would argue Spurs, blazers, and clips are above the cavs, but still below warriors bench.||1
Spurs are ahead of the Cavs also. I would say even a healthy clipper team also. The East is fucking garbage. |[GSW] Tim Hardaway|1
Gotta fits the Spurs in there too mate|Warriors|1
BURN!!!!!!||1
[deleted]||1
Gotta make it out of the 2nd round to be top 4. This was the second year in a row they couldn't do it. |Warriors|-6
If the three best teams are in the same conference one of them isn't making it out of the 2nd round.|Warriors|24
People are taking a joke way too seriously. |Warriors|-5
Oh come on Spurs have gotta be up there too?|Spurs|2
...at least we're number two right guys?|Thunder|3
New Updated ESPN Power Rankings\n\nCavaliers\n\nWarriors\n\nOKC\n|Cavaliers|5
Gotta put the Spurs there somewhere before the Cabs too||12
When they make it out of the 2nd round I will. |Warriors|-18
Don't forget the Spurs and at this point possibly the Blazers. |Supersonics|8
I would actually put the Spurs where the Cavs are |[OKC] Russell Westbrook|11
Don't forget to put the spurs in there somewhere!|Warriors|0
I'd put the Spurs in above the Cavs tbh|Thunder|51
1. This was intended to be a joke \n\n2. If we're being serious I'll put them above the Cavs when the team in it's current configuration manages to get out of the 2nd round. |Warriors|-30
I like how you have to be super particular in order to throw shade at us. \n\n"as soon as the October 1, 2015 to present Spurs in their most recent configuration make it out of the second round..we\'ll talk!"|[SAS] Tony Parker|21
I read that in a "wacky scientist" voice.||3
I mean... It does show dedication on his part xD|West|7
How deep into the warriors bench do you have to go to find a guy who would not start over JR smith?|Pacers|103
JR Smith on his Game would start over Barnes. JR Smith being JR Smith is barely ahead of Brandon Rush on the depth chart.|Knicks|1
Maybe that blond girl that Iggy was chatting up?|Thunder|5
Actual JR Smith or JR Smith that's as good as JR Smith think's JR Smith is?|Warriors|57
JR Smith vs the Hawks in the playoffs last year||1
You tryna get that consistency tho|Warriors Bandwagon|1
The latter is exactly how we describe Josh "Smoove" Smith.  Are there any other notoriously reckless players like them?|Rockets|4
They're not both J. Smith for no reason. ||1
Does the same apply for Jayden Smith's acting?|Rockets|2
Haha we can do both. \n\n>Actual JR smith: \n\n9 Warriors, or wherever you cut off at Barbosa\n\n> JR Smith that's as good as JR Smith think's JR Smith is\n\n0 Warriors.|Pacers|63
LOL. I was thinking the exact same thing. If this dude's serious I'm thinking Barbosa is the gauge. |Warriors|22
No way would barbosa start over jr smith on any team.  The lack of spacing would be atrocious.  However I don't think either should start on a championship team.||12
What about a shampionship team?|Warriors|16
This guy asks the real questions|Warriors|4
Good thing the Cavs drafted Andrew Wiggins to be a good defender of multiple positions.......oh wait|Heat|577
It's actually funny his future is better then the Cavaliers atm.|Kings|80
Than|Lakers|0
Thenn||-1
Let's not get too crazy here yet. The wolves although super young have to still make the playoffs. The team didn't even win 30 games. The Cavs are getting destroyed but still a top 5 team and likely to be that next year.|Knicks|7
Yeah, IDK why this guy is getting upvoted. We know what the Cavs are. Nobody knows what the Wolves are. Cavs' main pieces are locked up long term too. Wolves could end up being a contender or they could be the new 76ers. They've shown nothing yet. |Cavaliers|1
Cavs have like 2 years with this team, if that dude. Lol I'm getting upvoted because I'm right. The Wolves mystique about their future looks better then what the Cavs will be dealing with in a few years.|Kings|0
The future hasn\'t happened yet. As a Cleveland fan, I can tell you a thing or two about counting your chickens before they hatch.  \n\nOn a side note, this sub is *incredibly* reactionary. But just the other week, there were threads asking whether anyone would seriously challenge the Cavs in the East over the next few years and the consensus was generally "no." In the meantime, do you think the Wolves have what it takes to overcome OKC, GSW, or even SA in the West?  \n\nCavs are playing like shit and are looking at a possible sweep, but it has no bearing on how competitive our team will be in the coming years.  \n\nAnd you\'re not getting upvoted because you\'re right; you\'re getting upvoted because of the "DAE THINK--" reactionary circlejerk that is endemic to this sub. Try posting that after a Cavs finals win and you\'ll get destroyed.  |Cavaliers|4
OK man. It's gonna suck when LeBron leaves in 1-2 more years and I will just sit here with a smirk on my face. |Kings|0
You can smirk all you want if it happens. Until then, it\'s pointless to sit here and forecast the future. If I had a nickel every time I heard "Team X is gonna be great in Y years..." I\'d be living on my own personal island in Bora Bora. |Cavaliers|3
Timberwolves may in fact never be as good as I think they will be, but you are in a state of denial if you think this team currently in Cleveland is going to stay together 2+ years from now. It's inevitable that something/someone will change, and in the past that has been Lebron. History repeats itself.|Kings|1
I'm not debating you about what may or may not happen. It's a pointless undertaking and you have no firm bedrock to base your claims on. You don't bring a knife to a gun fight. Nobody in their right mind is going to trade the Cavs for the Wolves at this point. Nobody but you. |Cavaliers|4
At first I was salty about losing Love, but then when I realized that if Cleveland didn't win this year, they fucked themselves while giving us Wiggins for basically free, I felt much better |[MIN] Andrew Wiggins|81
I think KAT will have a much better career than love. There's a high chance Wiggins will too, hell even LaVine might if everything goes according to plan in Minnesota.\n\nEdit: clearly spellcheck fucked up what I was saying kids.|Kings|0
I agree on KAT, Wiggins is a push, and you're going a little too far with lavine.|Lakers|6
KAT and Wiggins for sure IMO, especially if they win a championship down the road together. Yeah, LaVine is definitely far fetched though|Kings|3
Did you have a stroke? Should I call 911?|Raptors|17
Clearly spell check. I don't know why people on the Internet still don't understand how it works.|Kings|3
Had the exact same reaction honestly. I remember thinking "fuuuck, Love was the "leader" of the Wolves, now we\'re super fucked". Two years later, and we\'re still fucked but now theres potential to eventually be a legitimate threat|Timberwolves|45
I loved his game coming out of college and remember having tons of arguments online about who was better that year, Mayo or Love. I didn't realize what a defensive liability he was. IMO a big who is a bad defender makes it very tough to beat good teams with them playing significant minutes.||4
KAT will be 5 times the player Love will ever be.|[GSW] Draymond Green|64
I don't want to shit on Love because I still really like him, but KAT will be better because his defence is already significantly ahead of him. KAT can switch onto the perimeter, is a rim protector, and has the range to shoot 3s. I expect him to add a consistent 3-ball this summer. The signs were there last season, shooting 34.1% from 3. I mean, he's averaging 18/10/2/2/1 roughly (rounded up or down) on shooting splits of 54/34/81. His free-throw shooting is actually worse than he expected it to be, which means hopefully we see an uptick in both the 3% and free throw %. Interior, perimeter defender plus interior, perimeter scorer is a crazy dual threat on both ends on the floor. Mid-range game is strong, too.|Timberwolves|5
Agreed, if we can just get him to stay around. I get ragged on a lot for being a Wolves fan (especially living in Wisconsin) but I have high hopes|Timberwolves|9
[deleted]||2
Welcome aboard haha |Timberwolves|1
Ugh.  Wisconsin has so few residents from other places that the whole state doesn't know how to comprehend non-packers/bucks/brewers fans.|Bulls|3
You have a good point. I'm a diehard Packers fan though. I simply like the Wolves because I liked the animal a lot as a kid and growing up in the Milwaukee Public School system, I was asked pretty frequently who I liked. Unfortunately for me, the Wolves were the 'white' basketball team, so it didnt really help me fit in at all lol|Timberwolves|2
We don't even know how to comprehend Bucks fans. I'm not really even a Bucks fan. I just like watching the Finals and the Bucks are the closest thing to an NBA team I associate with.|Bucks|3
yeah that's totally fair.  it seems to me that WI really loves football, and tolerates the sport of baseball but loves brewers games because tailgating is awesome at Miller.  Basketball isn't a tailgating sport as much, and the bradley center isn't the best either.|Bulls|1
baseball is loved for 2 reasons: tailgating and the name of the team involves beer.|Bucks|2
4 year rookie contract, RFA afterwards. Assuming we give him the max that only we can, 9 years of KAT. If we can't make it work in that time, fair game.|Timberwolves|11
KAT seems like a very loyal dude. I can see him sticking around for a long time in Minnesota. He only went to UK for a year and still constantly praises us like he was a 4 year starter (UK alumni).|Hawks|4
He's got a good support system around him, he was drafted by Flip, and he's friendly so I assume he has a good bond with Wiggy/Ricky/Zach. I still feel that they together can be special just because the defensive potential is there. Offensive brilliance can come through Zach (ice veins man, seriously) as well as Wiggy and KAT. Ricky as a distributor/play maker is just perfect for us too.|Timberwolves|4
Don't forget Dieng and Shabazz||2
They're all young too so they can grow together barring injury. If it works out like it should the wolves could be trouble in the west. |Hawks|3
You have Thibs.  You'll win at least 40 games next year. I promise. ||18
I wouldn't stop at 40, Wolves are huge sleepers||7
I'm pumped for it honestly. I'll never take off my Rubio jersey lol|Timberwolves|3
When it comes down to it, you guys should stick with Rubio. I heard rumors you guys were trying to trade him for Michael Carter Williams before the Trade deadline||1
KAT 105/60 on 225% shooting confirmed||70
This is only his Rookie season and he already has 5 times as many rings and Mvps as Love.|[GSW] Draymond Green|22
TIL 0 x 5 = 1. |Cavaliers|1
However, Love also has 10 times as many FMVPs and MIPs than KAT.||8
Blatt's NBA career died for this|Raptors|1371
im ok with it|Cavaliers|0
Actually Blatt looks pretty good right now thanks to this cavs team ||1
It kind of did. |Warriors|1
Didn't he sign with the kings?|Warriors|2
No in some turkish team that is building up to be a major force in the euroleague. ||2
TBF didn't Blatt get fired a day or two after his Cavs lost by 30+ to the Warriors?||2
This just in Tyronn Lue has been fired by the Cleveland Cavaliers, Lebron James' high school coach has been hired to fill the position but he knew nothing about it.|Hawks|4
Sweet sweet retribution. Plus he's getting paid that 3$ million dollar paycheck |Warriors|4
Blatt should have waited to sign to that Euro team. He's probably getting NBA calls right now|Warriors|4
I can only imagine what this team would look like if they'd bought into Blatt's system...|Braves|11
Yeah, Lue looked good against the competition in the east but he's not ready for the boys in the west. |Lakers|491
Really now?|Knicks|1
Did you save this comment, in case the Cavs won, so you could come back and act really smart?|Lakers|1
Nope just didn't participate in that thread knowing how Reddit loves it's over reactions so I went back for a laugh. |Knicks|1
Oh ok. Well, yes I was wrong.|Lakers|1
Lue didn't really look like anything. He had minor improvements over Blatt, but had the Cavs retained Blatt, I don't see the Cavs doing any better or worse. \n\nI mean, Bronny got the coach he wanted, but it's not the coach that will take this team to a championship, and the team itself has obvious and well pointed out holes and problems.|Supersonics|1
>Yeah, Lebron looked good against the competition in the east but he's not ready for the boys in the west.\n\nFTFY|Pistons|1
Men* in the west|Lakers|1
Still shows how dominant the west is vs the east, pretty unbalanced still. I doubted those sport heads that were saying how the east was looking way better then the west this year and only just based the first two months of the season haha. NBA really needs to rearange the conferences or just let the overall top 16 teams play the playoffs. Some changes need to get made sometime |Lakers|1
They would've won the east with any coach imo.|Lakers|1
Idk. I actually think Casey out coached him, Lue's team just showed up. And had a lot more talent.|[TOR] DeMar DeRozan|2
I don't want to be a dick, but I don't think Lue had anything to do with it.  I think we just got by on sheer talent and now that's not even close to being enough to face the Warriors.|Cavaliers|5
LeBron loves getting to the finals in the east, it's funny all the morons on ESPN hype his coasting through Eastern conference.||3
"competition"|Pacers|3
This series is a really bad look for the East. |Supersonics|827
Doo doo, pee pee, it is a bad conference.||1
This series is a good endorsement of doing away with the East vs. West finals. Makes no sense. Just seed the teams 1 through 16. Should help ensure the best two teams get to the finals.|Jazz|1
It's more about matchups really. The weird thing is, the Celtics would probably give the Warriors a better challenge than the Cavs, but they couldn't get past Cleveland.||1
The Warriors are just really good and the worst possible matchup for the Cavs, I honestly think a Thunder-Cavs series would have gone 7 (probably would lean towards the Thunder but much closer). The NBA is all about match ups and the Warriors death lineup is unbeatable against the Cavs.|Raptors|10
>This ~~series~~ season is a really bad look for the East. \n\n||12
Decade\n\nEdit: Entire post-MJ era|Raptors|6
the Heat have done well.||2
Most championships out of all East teams since 1998.\n\nAlbeit with a superstar coming to the team.\n\n2005 - Shaq (won the following season)\n2010 - LeBron (went back to back the following season)\n2016 - ???||1
Lets be real, the East never looked good.||419
this is why the nba needs to re-org into an AFC/NFC type conference instead of regional conferences||5
Or put playoff in teams in 1-16 tournament no matter the conference they're |Pistons|1
or that||1
Everyone couldn't stop talking about how the east caught the west thus year. Jokes on them. |[MEM] Marc Gasol|12
Some morons on here would have told you different earlier this year |76ers|5
Thats why they are morons lolz||9
Yeah, the Raptors really had to struggle their way to a couple of wins. That said, I at least expected the Cavs to be competitive in this series. |Supersonics|27
Ha - I called cavs in 7. Thought they looked so good in the rounds leading up to this.||1
they had the worst games of all time||1
Replace "expected" with "hoped" and I think that\'s more realistic. The difference in ability is amazing though, and I think Kerr is straight out coaching everyone this playoffs.||17
I don't know about that, Billy Donovan had him on the ropes for a while. Klay Thompson had to go god-mode to keep us in the WCF, remember? Everybody else though, yeah I would say he out coached them handily. |Warriors Bandwagon|64
God mode was really game 6 but I see your point. However I would argue that the adjustments that Kerr made were key as well, but obviously the guys on the court are making the plays.||10
Yes, it was game six, but still the WCF in a win or go home situation. \n\nAlso, you're right Kerr definitely made some moves. I didn't mean to imply he got caught with his pants around his ankles. What I was trying to say was that Billy Donovan basically hung in there with him punch for punch but in the end Warriors sealed the deal when they stole game 6 in Oklahoma. As far as I (and pretty much everyone I know) was concerned, game 7 was just a formality. |Warriors Bandwagon|14
Game 7 certainly was, but this entire series is turning out to be just a formality haha||6
remember when the East had a winning record against the west earlier in the regular season? pepperidge farm remembers|Cavaliers|38
The East had more above average teams than the West had. The West just has most of the great teams.|[OKC] Kendrick Perkins|39
4-1 is my count. Probably won't change for next year either unless KD really surprises everyone.|Celtics|6
Only KD can bring balance to the force. |Warriors|266
KD to TO confirmed?|Raptors|4
You were the chosen one! You were supposed to bring balance to the East, not join the Warriors!|Thunder Bandwagon|3
You wish|Thunder|3
No no no no |Thunder|3
Help me KD-Wan Kenobi... You're my only hope...|Spurs|9
Lol this series is going to just keep him away from the East. His best chance to be in the finals with an actual chance to win is in okc.|Thunder|7
Everyone keeps talking about how good lebron is for making the finals, who cares if he lost! |Lakers|1
Plz KD|Celtics|15

Kyrie Irving this series:\n\n12 for 36 FG (.333)\n\n1 for 7 3 pt (.143)\n\n5 assists, 6 turnovers\n\nGetting abused on defense\n\nJust straight up showing up small on his biggest stage|Celtics|2278
I mean they might be better without him for this series. Delay could be a better option. |Lakers|31
Hell, why not? Golden State looks to be better with Livingston over Curry. ||0
tom delay with his texas "hammer" lockdown D|Warriors|1
This was already the case last year. Kyrie and love are exploitable as long as you have a good defender that you can stick on them. |Bulls|3
Exactly. The Cavs have to delay the series until they can get a better team together. |[NYK] Kristaps Porzingis|180
DelayaDoOver|Nets|5
Sigh... back to rigging the lottery|Warriors|8
Nothing sums up his ability to run the offence more than the play in 4th quarter where Mozgov had a mismatch against Barbosa. Mozgov was calling for it but kyrie ignored him while trying to beat his man off the dribble, but then almost lost the ball so he gave it to Delly who immediately called Mozgov into the post and gave him the ball to take advantage of the mismatch|Raptors|11
complete turnaround from last year where he was killing it in game one on offense.  they're missing kyrie and smith on offense big time.  and when they aren't scoring, it is going to go down hill fast.  as we have seen in two games so far.|Bulls|76
The problem is Cleveland had success with their spot up shooters against bad defenses and thought they could keep up with GS's shooters. Only Lebron and Kyrie can create their own shot and the rest of the team doesn't pass or shoot well enough to match GS.|Warriors Bandwagon|14
Smith has had catch and shoot opportunities and doesn't take them anymore.  They were never going to keep up with the Warrior's shooting.  They were going to have to grind it out but Kyrie doesn't put a body on anyone.|Bulls|3
It comes down to the old adage "A jack of all trades, master of none, is often better, than a master of one" (btw yes that\'s the full saying). The Warriors just have guys that do absolutely everything. And you got Lebron to do that for the Cavs. It\'s a matchup hell for the cavs|Bulls|10
I feel like it's also the fact that Kerr has every bench player filling their ideal role. No player feels left out because he plays everyone at their best spot in the game so everyone contributes. |Warriors Bandwagon|4
Dude, I called it like a week ago. I said Cavs would not be able to afford cold runs. Warriors just don't stop scoring. Plain and simple. You need to keep up with it. If you can't then you lose. But this is different because the Warriors are playing excellent defense, and dominating the boards. Put back after put back. It's like the Cavs try hard on preventing a 3, but fail to get a rebound. I imagine it's extremely demoralizing for them. Then JR and Irving are simply not playing up to par. Love is being manhandled. Oh yeah, and Shumprt, IMO, is playing horrible. The Cavs have committed the dumbest turnovers I've seen in a while. Put short, the Cavs are playing sloppy ass ball, but more importantly, even if they were playing good ball, idk if it'd be enough. ||1
After overcoming the suddenly-amazing OKC defense last series, this series definitely feels like easy mode for the Dubs.\n|Lakers|5
What's funny is during the postgame interviews, [someone asked Klay and Dray that and they played it off pretty nicely](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNhwwxynv_Y&feature=youtu.be&t=5m14s). I guess they were trying not to give Cleveland bulletin board material but I feel like everyone else would admit it looks a lot easier from our standpoint as fans. |Warriors Bandwagon|1
The biggest part of the Warriors is just how relentless they are on offense and if you go cold at any point, it's extremely demoralizing. That seems to be what's going on here.|Lakers|27
if you cannot neutralize the warrior's runs it's over.  and with how bad cleveland's offense has been, they cannot even recover if a early run in the game gets away from them.|Bulls|12
[deleted]||817
People shit on that? It's farily obvious that Wall is a better player in every aspect than Kyrie. Kyrie couldn't guard Scalabrine if he had to. |Warriors|2
Walls so clearly better... Kyries very overrated |76ers|2
Really? I thought Wall was highly respected. Except for that one Radio host. |Lakers|2
For what it's worth, I agree.  Wall trades scoring punch (and he's still a good scorer) for much better defense and passing.|Lakers|2
Wall doesn't even trade *that* much scoring-wise for his D and passing. [Stats](http://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/pcm_finder.cgi?request=1&sum=0&y1=2016&p1=walljo01&y2=2016&p2=irvinky01&y3=2016&p3=lowryky01&p4=&p5=&p6=).\n\nKyrie did start coming off injury to be fair tho.|Wizards|1
And Lillard, I know they have different roles but at least Lillard can put up a respectable offense game.|Trail Blazers|3
How can you make that comparison when wall hasn't had a chance to be on the big stage....Kyrie has a great playoffs till now |Heat|111
[deleted]||-9
Lmao|[WAS] John Wall|9
Wall has taken his team to the playoffs and gone sorta deep as well as the clear cut leader. Kyrie wouldn't do that as the leader. Most likely lotto|Raptors|20
lol remind me last time kyrie led team to playoffs????|Knicks|51
[deleted]||-3
He's not wrong. You made that point about Wall vs Kyrie. Why is it not applicable when you compare Kyrie vs Lowry?|Warriors|3
you think melo wasnt criticized by knicks fans (including me) for that? not even relevant lol. respond to the point at hand. |Knicks|3
Yeah I mean this roster should have been at least a conference finals team. http://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/CLE/2014.html|Knicks|1
Very true, absolutely too premature to say that kind of stuff comparison wise. Wall is a great point guard but we haven't been able to see him in the brightest of spotlights since his Kentucky days |Pelicans|1
Idk man, Wall was absolutely filthy last year in the playoffs. |Raptors|6
Damn I had to look up his stats from last year but you're absolutely right. He had a great playoffs, except for his 39% shooting but his almost 12! assists certainly makes up for that. And he is much better on defense. I think it's fair to say they're on the same tier, but it is tough to rank is all I'm saying|Pelicans|1
For sure. Wall, Dame, Kyrie, and Lowry are really hard to rank 4-7. \n\nBut Kyrie is absolutely shit on defence this year, not just this series. He just hasn't played someone to truly expose him. Hell, Lowry played amazing against him and he played like inconsistent garbage for the majority of the playoffs.|Raptors|1
Gotta agree. Kyrie just seems to have stuck around in that 2nd tier category but never proving that he should be above it (and so far showing that he may not even deserve to be in that upper echelon). I was kind of hoping In this finals he would show that spark that would set him apart, but his performance hasn't been anything close to that. Very disappointing to watch so far. |Pelicans|1
This is the first time Kyrie has been in the brightest spotlight and he is playing like garbage. |Bullets|5
Absolutely a fair point which I hadn't considered too much. He had been very good this post season up to the finals, but let's not kid ourselves, the Warriors are much better defensively than any team the cavs faced coming into this series. The difference is stark too, kyrie is having trouble, outside of a few open jumpers off the pick and roll, creating any offense for himself and even worse, offense for his teammates. The Warriors guards and their bigs on switches are completely neutralizing his game and his ability to make plays. Kerr is killing this series defensively |Pelicans|1
I see where you're coming from, but John Wall is easily the best player on his team and he's taken teams to the playoffs and might have made the ECF last year if he didn't hurt his hand.\n\nKyrie had several years being the best player on his team before Lebron came back to Cleveland and the most he ever won was 33 games.|Pistons|7
I don't entirely disagree, i guess my point was just saying wall > kyrie simply because of 2 finals games is dumb logic when wall has never even been in the finals so there's nothing to compare it to|Heat|2
That's fair I suppose. I think Wall's the more complete player, but comparing his body of work to two of Kyrie's games is unfair|Pistons|2
is this a joke? he was a hand injury away from being the best player on a conference finals team. what has kyrie done solo? |Knicks|151
They're making the argument that wall was never on a stage like this so we can't say whether or not he would have played like ass. And up until the finals, Kyrie was ballin out|[MIA] Udonis Haslem|-1
I'm not disagreeing just confused, when was  Wall in the conference finals?||0
He hasn't. He's saying that if Wall didn't injure his hand in game 2 of the EC semis against ATL last season the Wiz might've had a chance to go the the ECF.|Wizards|3
Had a horrible supporting cast?|Hornets|1
Hawks still would have won that series. |Hawks|2
Maybe, but that shit would have gone to seven for sure.|Wizards|6
Well.|Supersonics|1
Uncle Drew|Bucks|1
Yeah on a conference finals team *that doesn't have Lebron* hahaha what kind of argument is that |Magic|10
And wall doesn't have two other stars on his team, with one being LeBron James.  I'm sure he'd have more success too|Knicks|31
Seriously. The people criticizing Wall for not having as much playoff success as Kyrie are insane. Kyrie didn't lead the Cavs to shit before LeBron came. If the counter to that point is that the Cavs didn't have much talent elsewhere to help Kyrie, then you can't criticize Wall this season for not leading his team to the playoffs. Wall's team really needs to improve in terms of talent, coaching, and luck with injuries.\n\nI think the Cavs are a much better team if you replace Kyrie with Wall and I think the Wizards don't reach the playoffs this year with Kyrie instead of Wall. |Heat|23
There are obviously arguments for both sides|Warriors|4
Reason why I shit on Kyrie as much as possible.|Wizards|11
That's honestly the most pathetic thing I've ever heard. Holy shit man, that's just unbelievably sad.||-1
I talk shit on Kyrie too but when he's on I give dude props. It's just a lil trashtalk bro. Doubt he actually hates Kyrie or wishes him ill. |Wizards|1
oh i've had cavs fans tell me based on projections that kyrie will better than curry. |Wizards|2
We didn't. We came to an agreement that wall was better |Raptors|29
Who's we?||1
the Toronto Raptor Fan Base |Raptors|6
People shit on us when we say Lowry's better. At least Lowry plays D when he sucks.|Raptors|6
And he got a fatter ass. Lowry > Irving easy.|Wizards|5
Wall is easily better than Kyrie.|[MIA] LeBron James|5
I have always thought that the only thing Irving has over Wall is his scoring and he's not even doing that well right now|Wizards|8
shit at least Wall can defend well. hoping to see him on the come up next season.|Warriors|108
Wall is no joke. No wasted energy. Kyrie looks ridiculously spastic next to him. |[NYK] Charles Oakley|1
I'd love to see KD join Wall. Imagine the Eastern Conference finals of James/Irving vs Durant/Wall...damn. I'd watch the hell out of that series. |Warriors|1
Man for some reason it feels like Walls been around a lot longer, even though he was drafted just a year before Kyrie. Must be all the injuries|Celtics|2
Maybe he'll get a superstar team mate. One can only hope.|NBA|8
KD?|Lakers|6
i presume it could be someone starting with a "K"? HMMM.|Warriors|6
Kris Middleton?|[TOR] Amir Johnson|1
Kendrick Perkins?|[NYK] Kristaps Porzingis|9
Kris Humphries?|Bulls|6
He is imo, people are just obsessed with Kyrie's handles and all his marketing that they forgot who truly is better. Wall plays great defense too, something Kyrie can only dream of having.||558
> all his marketing\n\nYall need to realize how the game works.||0
Thing is, you can be as good of a defender as you want to be. It's all effort. ||1
But..but..he's Uncle Drew!|Supersonics|2
Kyrie is DeRozan except he has a PG body and he shoots 3s||4
>and he shoots 3s\n\nNot in this series he doesn't lol\n|76ers|2
Kyrie's a straight up scrub||7
Pretty sure I saw my doctor wearing some Kyries at the hospital the other day.|Clippers|2
I love me some John Wall blocks|Warriors|5
> people are just obsessed with Kyrie's handles and all his marketing\n\nNot after this series.|[CHI] Michael Jordan|4
Kyrie is only interested and only able to get his. He never looks for anyone, never tries to create, he's got one ability that's to score, nothing else, truly 1 dimensional. ||5
100% agreed handle + contested shot maker + 1st overall pick status has just hyperinflated everyone's opinion of kyrie||5
John Wall was also 1st overall.|Wizards|1
Kyrie is a better scorer but Wall is significantly better overall|Celtics|13
Kyrie got that crazy handle; however, the last time I checked handles is only one part of offense.||51
Can't have sick handles on defense either |Spurs|1
That and he's better at 3s\n\n|Heat|7
Wall shot better percentage from three this year along with more PPG, assists, rebounds, steals and blocks, all while having to be the number one option on offense considering Beal's injury woes. |Bullets|27
Kyrie's a better scorer and shooter. Just because he was hurt and came back mid-season doesn't mean he hasn't been a better shooter and scorer literally every year besides this one. ||-5
Wait... wouldn't it make sense that you have more volume stats as the number one option? Or are we also shocked that Love isn't doing better than 25/15 in Cleveland? Not saying anything about Kyrie's defense or who is better, but a good player is going to shine through on a worse team.|Hornets|1
maybe it would make sense for Kyrie to have lower points per game but be should be doing it on much higher efficiency considering the number of open looks Lebron can earn you. |Bullets|2
Yeah not refuting that, just meant the volume stats. It never seemed like he was the right kind of of to go alongside LeBron. Kyrie likes to be flashy and never piled up assists, and LeBron likes to have the ball in his hand too much to hand over that role.|Hornets|1
Really? Lol my god Kyrie |Heat|11
And Wall didn't have arguably the greatest player in the world to take the pressure off him. No star PG is asked to do more with less than Wall. Maybe Dame but his coach is great and his team was healthy this year.|Wizards|29
Kyrie would probably be much better if he didnt dribble so well. It sounds stupid, but I think his talent entices him to overdribble way too much. |Nets|14
I kind of get a similar vibe watching Westbrook when okc is down late in a game. His speed and strength let him push the pace and let him get too far into a hopeless drive and then he either has to Chuck a shot or dish an awkward pass that if it connects leads to a teammate taking a shot that's just as bad||7
lol Uncle Drew marketing is real. That's why my lil bro dick rides Kyrie.|Warriors|77
Wall is a better playmaker too|Celtics|269
You definitely didn\'t need the word "better" there|[BOS] Marcus Smart|1
Shit, Wall is a playmaker period. Thats more than you can say for Kyrie really|Bulls|3
John Wall looks like he's been in and won fights.  Kyrie looks like a dude who believes in using your words.|Mavericks|6
He's probably the second best playmaker in the league. Anyone have thoughts on this? I could be wrong. I'd say CP3 is number 1. ||8
That's why Durant needs to go to DC...what Wall/Beal/Durant can't get to the finals in the East? Please.||2
No arguments on that, closest to contest that #2 spot would be Rondo.||13
I don't watch OKC but what about Westbrook?||1
he is actually a sg bro||2
Lol this guy|Grizzlies|3
Wall, Rondo, and Rubio all contest for that number two spot IMO. |[MIN] Ricky Rubio|1
I've been to one Wizards game, and I swear to god Wall would've had like 25 assists if his teammates could actually hit open shots. I was blown away by how fast he was out there|Cavaliers Bandwagon|9

Wall is cuter too.|Wizards|108
\xe2\x9c\x8b pause |Pistons|0

Some of my friends went to UK.  One of the girls said that she knew girls who paid to blow Wall.  I wouldn't doubt it. |Supersonics|3
I picture some nasty nasty nasty looking girls if they are offering money to suck a dick. That seems so outrageous to me. I don't doubt that he slayed tons of fine women there at all, though |Pelicans|5
No way,  I have lots of friends that go there. UK players will sometimes show up to frat parties and get absolutely hounded by girls. They have their choice of practically any chick since everyone at UK loves the players so much. Note that these are fine ass sorority girls too. I've heard rumors that a lot of basketball players have STDs and I always hear that Devin Booker for sure has one lol. I actually know a girl who fucked several players from last year's team...||3
go on.|Wizards|1
I don\'t doubt that. Lol I doubt sorority girls are saying "I\'ll give you $50 (just throwing a number out) if you let me suck your dick". To be honest I\'d be freaked out if a girl offered me money for that. That\'s too good to be true. |Pelicans|2
Them being drunk college chicks on a campus that is 73% female probably helped lead to it.  |Supersonics|7

He is not healthy, he suffers from hog ball, people are clearly open but he chooses to dribble into a corner.||1

Definitely. Gave it to Curry with no lube. |Knicks|2
Man, he totally turned things around. What a great series.|[OKC] Kendrick Perkins|1
SAVAGE||2
If I recall correctly though he was actually good offensively in game 1 last year. He's not even doing that now.|Celtics|2
If I recall correctly, the line-up of death didn't exist at that time last year (I think it debuted in game 3?). Last year, both teams were in the first year of a first time NBA head coach. Kerr hadn't come up with the line-up of death until after Kyrie went down. Kerr is so much better at manipulating his line-ups in his second year, meanwhile Lue is just halfway through his first season and has a lot to learn about rotations and the strengths and weaknesses of his roster. Dan Gilbert and LeBron fucked their own chances at winning the championship when they fired Blatt and they deserve to get embarrassed in the Finals for it.\n\nAnyways, I think that Kyrie was successful in game 1 last year because Kerr just wasn't experienced enough to know how to shut down Kyrie on defense, and take advantage of his shortcomings as a defender.|Warriors|8
*This 1000%* What's funny is most of the intelligent basketball breakdown websites I read and pods I listen to have been preaching this all year. \n\nIn Zach Lowe's preview he talked about how last year the Warriors assistant coaches and staff were actually concerned when Love and Kyrie went down; because, they were looking forward to those matchups. |Lakers|6
Recreation of countless conversations about this on this sub:\n    \n\nLebron took the Warriors to 6 by himself, so obviously if you add Kyrie and Love they will do even better.\n\n*response about how the injuries may have forced CLE to play a style that matched up better with GSW*\n\nAre you seriously telling me that Kyrie and Love aren't an upgrade over Delly and Thompson? Kyrie even defended Steph well in game 1. Lol you fucking bandwagoner.|NBA|-2
Offensively they are. Defensively they are not. Unfortunately for the Cav's you have to play both. We are literally seeing this play out in front of us. \n\nKyrie's defense is like hot Nas's rap albums, he had 1 good one in 10.\n\nLOL, at the guy with no flair bitching about bandwagon flair. \n\nI am sorry that my enjoyment of the game bothers you. I am sorry the Final's are proving an argument you dont like has merit. I am sorry we just get to watch the Finals games that are presented. |Lakers|8

Coming into the series I thought their Big 3 would be outmatched, but I didn't think it would be nearly this bad.  I'm not sure if it's just the Ws playing refined basketball after nearly going down to the Thunder or what.  Cavs look like a team playing in November out there.|Warriors|9
I thought they'd be outmatched too. By our starters.|Warriors|11
Don't mess with Andre and the Brazilian Blur! |Warriors Bandwagon|7
Would've been 5/5 *again* if he didn't have to take that 40 ft 3-pointer with the shot clock running out\n\nEdit: Forgot he missed that corner three in garbage time too|Warriors|6

> I'm not sure if it's just the Ws playing refined basketball after nearly going down to the Thunder or what.\n\nOr maybe the Cavs wouldn't have beaten OKC either and are just a product of a weaker eastern conference.||10

Definitely. I remember reading some awesome post or comment on here a while back about how not having KLove and Kyrie was the best possible thing for the Cavs. Turned them into a scrappy rebounding, hard-nosed defensive team. Also helped that lebron went off the whole series tho|Warriors|1
Beast mode LeBron > Non Beast mode LeBron||2
Lebron built this team.||2
Defense matters?|Lakers|3
That's not true(at least the team that played in the finals), but last years team is better against the Warriors. No place for love and kyrie in this series |76ers|4
Mozgov would abuse Mozgov in the paint||5
Coaching makes a hell of a difference.|Bulls|841
I don't think it's the coaching. Lue can't really put Delly in over Kyrie, even though it would be a tougher matchup. Mosgov and Thompson would be a good 1-2 punch but really, they're just overmatched. They don't have the personnel.|Warriors|9
I mean, every single Cav is playing poorly. That falls on coaching. ||24
Players playing poorly falls on coaching, or what? \n\nI don't get how the coaching staff can contrive an answer to a great team without the personnel to do it. GSW is playing good defense and the Cavaliers just aren't showing up (I feel like defense just doesn't give them a chance). The staff can try to make plays to get people open but against a team like GSW that will be rather difficult, plus the factor of fatigue.\n\n(Still a newbie in regards to coaching so I know nothing but it still seems like a jump to say Lue and company is to blame. If someone would enlighten me into this sub's mind-frame I would appreciate it.)||0
>cavaliers aren't showing up\n\nYep, that's on the coach. ||4
I meant that as in the shots aren't going in. What would a good coach do to make their player's shots go in? Against GSW specifically.||1
Ideally you\'d want 5 players on-court who can play on both sides of the ball. A Miami Heat line-up would look like Chalmers, Wade, LeBron, Bosh, Birdman back then. In that line-up, all 5 could defend, with 3 defending at all-NBA levels. Even if they brought on a poor defensive player, they could be covered by the other 4. Offensively, transition defence for the opposition was impossible when Wade and LeBron were running the floor. 3-ball came courtesy of Chalmers and Bosh plus off the bench from James Jones, Ray Allen, Mike Miller, and Shane Battier. The fact is while LeBron needs snipers around him, they don\'t have to be the starters necessarily. A LeBron + rim protector + 3 sniper line-up would be deadly against benches, but doesn\'t work against the opposition\'s starters. It doesn\'t help that LeBron\'s range has shrunk to 3 feet for some reason.\n\nAt Cleveland, they start with Kyrie, JR, LeBron, Love, TT. Out of those, 3 can defend at a good level (1 of which at all-NBA level). Love is a sub-par defender, but at least he has size. Kyrie is a small sub-par defender, which makes him and Love both defensive liabilities. Now hiding 2 players just isn\'t as easy as 1 and it hurts on court. People ask, "Rubio can\'t shoot, why\'s he useful?" One of the many reasons is that we never have to hide him on defence. In fact, anybody who\'s watched Rubio will tell you he\'s one of the best defensive PGs in the league.\n\nOff the bench, they have Shump, RJ, and Delly who play good defence. This is the opposite of what he had at Heat with defence coming off the bench now.\n\nCompare this to GSW, who can go Curry, Klay, Iggy, Green, Bogut. 4/5 are plus defenders and Curry is average/above average. They bring in Barnes (+ defender), Livingston (+ defender) as well. Defence is the key to a successful NBA team and how LeBron/Cavaliers have neglected that I\'ll never know. Before Warriors, there were the Spurs who built their team on the defence of Kawhi, Duncan, and Danny Green versus the Heat. Before them, the Heat themselves. The Mavericks had Tyson Chandler as a defensive rock I believe.\n\nThe team that gave the Warriors most trouble is also the best defensive outfit they faced (not consistency wise, but ability wise): Westbrook, Roberson, Durant, Ibaka, Adams is an absolute defensive nightmare with 5 PLUS DEFENDERS! No wonder they struggled! Even Adams could guard on switches. Defence wins championships, and the Cavs just don\'t have it. Unless they catch fire or Irving/Love make a massive defensive step up, they just can\'t pull it off this year.|Timberwolves|10
What tf is defence?|Warriors|1
Underrated post. When i read\n\n>Compare this to GSW, who can go Curry, Klay, Iggy, Green, Bogut. 4/5 are plus defenders\n\nI realised that literally the only way cavs can win is some sheer brilliance on offense. Boggles my mind that they were much more competitive last year with half a team than they are this year. That, I cant work out.|Celtics|5
Delly, JR, LeBron, TT, Mozgov. Rim protector + all 5 are at least average defenders. Delly is a plus defender, LeBron is an elite defender, etc. Offence is lacking, but defence is there. LeBron reduces that offensive disparity by slowing down the pace and grinding in the post. The positives are that they have height in attack as well (lobs, putbacks) and they can space the floor very minimally through JR and Delly. However, the lane is now jammed with two interior players. Ideally for this to succeed, LeBron would've had to have a functional mid-range game so that Mozgov/TT would clean up boards and LeBron could help spread the floor as well.\n\nNow, the thing is while Kyrie and Love are better offensive players, they're not producing on that end. And because of the lack of offensive production and defensive slack, they become net negative players. For them to be as good of a matchup as Delly/Mozgov were last year, both would have to produce good offence and be average defensively (opposite of Delly/Mozgov). That is just to be equal, mind you! And of course, good offence is harder to produce when the defenders you face are elite/above average. Defence is about fundamentals and intelligence (demonstrated by Iggy every night), offence requires intelligence, intuition, and innovation.|Timberwolves|6
>  They don't have the personnel.\n\nHilarious given the Cav's payroll.|Wizards|55
Yeah, it's not like they have the highest luxury tax in history!||17
We can all agree the GM Lebron is definitely worse than player Lebron. Arguably Coach Lebron is better than GM Lebron.|Bulls|33
Shumpert and Mozgov being shells of what they were last year won't do the Cavs any good too.|[LAC] Chris Paul|21
What happened to Shumpert?|Warriors|7
God knows, mate. But it's not just Shump. Cleveland stopped moving the ball, became trigger-shy from 3, and generally just haven't shot the ball at all. They want open chances, but they won't get that against the Warriors. Half-openings need to be met with a shot. Delly does this way to often where he passes up a shot to drive into traffic. Delly, Kyrie, Love, Frye gotta trust their shot because they're not winning this series without a 3-ball.|Timberwolves|3
So..Lebron was a better coach last season?|Warriors|192
LeBron's always been a better head coach than Ty Lue, we just didn't know it until Ty Lue became a head coach.|Bullets|1
No LeBron had a coach last season.. Now he has Lue who is his whipping boy, getting ride of Blatt was a bad idea in my view |[CHA] Kemba Walker|20
And defense.  They'd prob be better off benching Kyrie and Love which is crazy that injuries did anyway last year.  The last Finals may be viewed VERY differently in context if the Cavs get swept.|[CHI] Michael Jordan|17
Dude, Cavs aren't getting swept. Let's not get ahead of ourselves here.|Warriors|2
They certainly could get swept.|[CHI] Michael Jordan|2
Yep, they'll win one at home then Warriors will take game five at Oracle for the trophy.|Supersonics|2
Yes they are.||2
And pre-knee-surgery Moz was such an underrated player. He really showed up that series on both sides of the court. And more importantly, he was the rim protector for the team. A role that is currently nonexistent.|[PHI] Kyle Korver|25
I saw some info graph on espn cant remember if it was G1 or G2 that saud something like 60- ish points for the team were made off 3pt shots, so you have to balance the value of a rim protector vs a masterful 3pt shooting team.|Celtics|1
Didn't he get like 28 points in a game last finals?|Timberwolves|2
Yea but the Warriors abused him being in by going small ball.  His +/- for that game was -5 even with his 28 points and they lost be 20.|Bulls|2
True good point.|[CHI] Michael Jordan|5
I actually think that Kyrie and Love make them worse. They are the type of players that numbers lie about. There's a reason their teams never made the playoffs when they lead them.|Raptors|20
Lol. |[POR] C.J. McCollum|1
There's more to why Love didn't bring the Wolves to the playoffs. |[MIN] Derrick Williams|14
There always is. In Kevin Love's 6 seasons with the wolves he averaged a PER of 23.2. That's really good. In fact, if he retired right then instead of going to the Cavs he would've had the 20th best career PER all time. Just one spot after Curry, and above players like Dirk, Kobe, Garnett, and many many others. Yet, his team never made the playoffs in 6 seasons. Look at Damien Lillard this year. His team had every reason to fail, and yet they were the 5th seed. There's always easy excuses to fail for every player. That's because this is a hyper-competitive league and you fail by not going above and beyond. I bet if you replaced prime Love with a prime Dirk, or Garnett, or Kobe, they would've willed that wolves team to win. Prime Love had numbers as good as those players, but that's why numbers sometimes lie.|Raptors|3
Love is great at certain things: defensive rebounding, outlet passes and 3pt shooting.\n\nHis time on Cavs has shown that he\'s not a player to build around, he\'s a piece of the puzzle. I mean, just imagine two seasons ago if the Warriors had traded Klay for Love. We\'d probably be watching him hitting five or six threes a game for the Warriors, putting up 20 and 10 per game because he\'d be surround be guys that can play defense, spread the floor and actually run an offense.\n\nBut as part of a "big three" it\'s clear he\'s not a guy that can carry a team or even an offense if he\'s not utilized correctly.|Supersonics|2
In 2014 the Timberwolves actually played like a very good team when Love was on the court. It's not his fault that the team couldn't keep its shit together when he was off the court.\n\nThen they heavily underachieved with their record based on their SRS because of mostly variance in close games.|[NYK] Jared Jeffries|3

I was once on a flight to San Antonio from Dallas with Michael Finley in 2008.  I think it was right before the second round of the playoffs started.  Some sweet old lady recognized Finley and she told him she was sorry to see that the Mavs got eliminated in the 1st round.  I got a nice laugh watching Finley kindly explain to her that he was on the Spurs and he didn\'t play for the Mavs anymore.  \n\nThen when the boarding call came, he got on the plane while I waited for my group to be called.  When I got on the plane I was confused because I didn\'t see Findog in First Class.  I make it back into coach where my seat is and I see Finley, all 6\'7" of him in a middle seat sandwiched in between two people that were probably 5 and change.  It was the most awkward looking thing to see.  I kinda felt bad for him. I thought about offering him my isle seat, but he was with the Spurs so there was nothing I could do for him.|Mavericks|29

Arenas was right with his twitter comment. Every game has a new record, they're meaningless at this point.||5
That stat kind of has meaning. |Warriors|2
Yeah, it certainly does, but with every game there is a new record broken. They are picking the meat off of the bones already. It isn't like GSW set a finals point differential record for one game.\n\nEdit: I don't feel that the record for point differential across the first two games is worth making a big deal over. With all of the records GSW broke it seems dull... It's far more meaningful than many of the mentioned records but at this point I feel like breaking records isn't all that meaningful now.||2

You could make do with 4 - LBJ was doing okay.||5
Or anyone else to make a real effort. Sad, considering it looked like LeBron tried to get the team involved and they weren't having any of it. |Warriors|250
I feel bad for Bron. When the Cavs lose, people will lay it at his feet, with only passing mentions of underperforming teammates. It\'ll come back to "LeBron couldn\'t rally his teammates, he couldn\'t lead them". At a certain point, however, it\'s up to the teammates to show up and hustle. He can\'t be their muscle and their heart and the scorer. |Warriors Bandwagon|1
Thats a large portion of it. The Ownership and fornt office has done a shit job. They are overpaying all those guys a shit ton. |Warriors|3
Are we not gonna discuss that Lebron isn't what he used to be either?||1
It also looked like Lebron didn't really have his mojo going. He took some shots and went right back into passive mode. How many times is he going to do this? The last few desperate moments of Game 6 in the 2013 Finals ( and possibly that legendary conference finals game against the Celtics) is the only time he has really turned that switch into desperation. I wish he would just do it.|[PHO] Steve Nash|3
Game 5 against the Pistons? Last year's finals? ECF against Orlando? |Knicks|1
Last years finals wasn't Lebron turning a switch. He was literally the only person who could create his own shot besides JR Smith. The Pistons game (which I was gonna mention) was just pure domination but he didn't have that desperateness that he had in that Game 6 2013. You could even see it on Lebrons face that he wanted that win more than anything. I guess he was really worried about his legacy.|[PHO] Steve Nash|1
I think some kind of switch had to be flipped for him to lead both teams in points, rebounds and assists. He's the first to ever do that in the finals. He shot poorly but he averaged 35,13 and 8. |Knicks|1
The way I see it, with his sky-high usage rate he was bound to pick up many assists, the same way Westbrook did last season. The rebounds are pretty nice though, I'll give him that.|[PHO] Steve Nash|1
Yeah but he was also averaging 35 a game. That's a lot of offense, no? |Knicks|1
True, normally I'm against hero ball but the cavs need it if they want a win let alone a chance. |Warriors|2
I\'m really looking at his over-passing as him having a fall-back excuse (Read: "I need a better supporting cast") when the inevitable comes. He only goes into this super passing mode when his team is on the brink of defeat in huge moments. Look at the regular season: If Lebron saw a basket, he was taking it. If the passing lane was open, he would pass it. He wasn\'t afraid of taking shots, yet he always seems to be in the Finals.|[PHO] Steve Nash|5
Yep. Same things held true in the 2011 Mavs series and 2009 and 2010 series against the Magic and Celtics.|Lakers|1
ffs. Last year Lebron put up incredible numbers with no help while leading a hopelessly outmatched team against a great one and people said he was shooting too much and was being a glory hog. Then this year he passes and facilitates and does everything within his power to get the rest of his team involved and people say he's afraid of taking shots.||3
I wasn't impressed by Lebron last year. Brick after brick, missing layups, not nearly the same level of desperation, worst defender on his team. I know he had 'little to no help' but it wasn't his offensive game that kept them in the series, it was the defence of the team and the offensive rebounding by TT.|[PHO] Steve Nash|1
They all think they are overmatched. And its probably true. actually definitely true.||2
LeBron's problem is that he was backing down with intent to pass a lot of times. Resulted in a ton of TOs.|Timberwolves|4
> Sad, considering it looked like LeBron tried to get the team involved and they weren't having any of it.\n\nYeah I feel fucking bad for Lebron. Either get called a ball hog, or fail to carry the team. ||17
He can try to make others better around him, but they need to buy in. Otherwise they might as well mail it in now. |Warriors Bandwagon|4
Kyrie and Love are nowhere near the level of Wade and Bosh. No matter how good you are, you need other great players around you, and Cleveland doesn't seem to have that.|[OKC] Kendrick Perkins|304
Omfg stop that 'lebron need more help' bullshit\n\nHe had the help, he just fire him |Warriors Bandwagon|6
He specifically chose his help and coach too. |Lakers|3
In their prime of their careers? Sure,I agree. But Kyrie was a superstar PG when Lebron joined the Cavs and was trying to become more than that, to reach that top 5 in the NBA level that Wade was at for many years. Similarly Love was a top 10 player in the NBA (albeit on a terrible team) when Lebron joined the Cavs. They are not at that level anymore, very clearly, but still you can't come up with a million excuses. Truly great players make good players play up to their level. |[NYK] Patrick Ewing|16
Kyrie wasn't a superstar point guard. He's just had crazy hype because he's still young and he was a #1 pick||20
This is a really shitty way to defend my argument so im gonna concede and say you won, but if you look back at the posts from when Lebron joined the Cavs on this sub 90% of people said he was going to a better team. |[NYK] Patrick Ewing|14
Well like I said, people had good reason to think that because kyrie *looked* like he could be a very good compliment to lebron. Everyone thought he would be this elite shooter that lebron would be kicking it to.  People also thought klove was better than he is...but as a wolves fan I knew he'd get exposed for what he is||7
I'm stunned how bad the offense has been.  Kyrie is a legit star offensive player.  Has to be top 10 in the league.  Love is a great piece on offense as well - a true PF who can create his own shot and hit 3's at a high percentage.\n\nI expected them to get roasted on D - Kyrie and Love are both weak there, and I thought it would be the deciding factor in the series.  But I didn't expect the Cavs offense to be so bad.  The Woyas D is strong but there's no excuse for how awful the Cavs offense has been the last two games.||2
They were last week|Bucks|9
When the Cavs were setting records with 3-point shooting I saw this excuse nowhere. The Cavs have a great team, but they're up against a historic one.|[PHO] Steve Nash|7
Well yeah.... Wade is arguably the third best SG of all time and is top five minimum and Bosh was one of the best pfs in his time. Not really comparable. They all have very different games|Rockets|123
MJ. Kobe. Drexler. West. Pete. The Answer. |Pelicans|-3
People say that about Wade alot but how much of that is recency bias? Didnt Jerry West play sg? What about Pistol Pete? I dont really know but it seems like there have to be some great sgs of days past. |Lakers|5
That's why he said arguably, cause it's gonna come down to opinion at  a certain point.|Jazz|6
I wasnt disparaging top 3 or whatever I was just wondering about other possible great sgs. Always seems weird that the best of all time are all in the last 25 years|Lakers|2
I mean it was a completely different game 25-50 years ago. so its very hard to compare|Jazz|7
Well because now it's a career you have kids that grew up and dreamed of playing basketball and practiced all their life to be as good as they are now. Jerry west did not have an entire generation to look up to as an icon and give him the motivation to be the very best at a young age|Heat|6
Holy shit you have some recency bias here. Wade might be top 20.|Celtics|2
Wasn't love regarded as at least a top three PF when he got traded from Minnesota?  ||2
It is comparable.  Lebron is playing with them.  Jesus fucking christ get your head in the game.||39
Wasn't Love an All Star double double machine who was considered one of the best PF's in the league? What happened to him.|Lakers|12
It's funny everyone seemed to be praising him through the playoffs and now he's the problem.|[LAL] Kobe Bryant|3
He's no longer literally the only good player on his team?|[OKC] Detlef Schrempf|12
~~That and idk if he fits what the cavs want to do on offense~~ I am wrong on this|[SAS] Tim Duncan|0
Sure he does.  He's a true PF who can hit a high percentage from 3pt.  That's one of the most valuable things you can be in the NBA on offense.  He can even create his own shot when necessary.\n\nHis problem is that his defense sucks.  Bosh learned to hit the corner 3, and he was a good rim protector, good weakside help defender, super long arms.  Draymond can hit the 3 and switch onto any play on the cavs - he can guard Kyrie, or Mozgov, or LeBron.  \n\nKevin Love can hit the 3, and then gets roasted in the PNR on the other end.  That's the difference between the ELITE power forwards and Kevin Love.  His offense is fine, his defense blows.||6
I don't know a lot about basketball, but I was so impressed by how Bosh accepted his role and changed his game to make everything work. Playing center, adding a 3pt shot to his game, focusing more on defense than on getting 25 points a game. It sucks he has these problems with blood clots. |[CLE] LeBron James|13
Bosh is an all-around great guy; he's smart, caring, and humble. I hope he gets healthy.|[OKC] Kendrick Perkins|9
We're getting somewhat used to seeing LeBron having to do it all in the Final with a weak supporting cast (even the Heat in 2014 looked old and tired) but LeBron is not really doing it all so far.  I've never seen him so well-guarded at the rim, even including several signature unstoppable drives.|[CHI] Michael Jordan|34
No doubt GSW is playing great defense, but LeBron is also not getting any younger. You can see it on some plays where you think afterwards that his first step used to be quicker or his jump a bit higher. |[CLE] LeBron James|9
To be fair, Miami shot well that series. The Spurs shooters were just unreal that time. |[MIA] Dwyane Wade|20

we would have made the finals if we did not lose half our starters to injuries etc.\n\nassuming free agency goes decently (and with riley running things we have nothing but confidence there), then next year i expect to make the finals.\n\ndo we win the finals?  well, who knows.  but we'll make it there.|Heat|1
oh no doubt|Celtics|1
I\'m not the biggest fan of these arguments. It rests on the whole "that squad + Lebron" would have kicked ass. But with Lebron making north of $22 how would they have gotten the pieces they got to be this good this year. If Lebron stays, we don\'t have Justise nor probably Richardson. Obviously he would be a huge boost but the team make up would be wildly different. And I\'m still adamant that Wade looked so amazing this season because he finally got an offseason off to rest. Had Lebron stayed in Miami, they probably would have made the finals. But I don\'t know how good they would be versus the Warriors |[MIA] Udonis Haslem|3
LeBron gets a max so who on the Heat now isn't on the roster?\n\nBut yeah I can still agree. Wade played great this season.|Trust The Process|15
If Lebron comes back, Deng walks. |Heat|2
If LeBron was on the Heat, they wouldn't have the players they currently have & they wouldn't have lost enough games to get a good player in Winslow. \n\nBosh would most definitely still have his health troubles.\n\nI think his situation here is better than whatever situation that version of Heat would be in.\n\nBut yes a \n\nDragic - Wade - Deng - LeBron - Whiteside lineup would wreak havok.|[LAL] Luke Walton|8

Fuck even the 76e... hahaha who am I kidding \xf0\x9f\x98\x82|NBA|33
He'd still be in the east so they probably would have made the finals with lebron.|[LAL] Kobe Bryant|1
Even the 76ers would likely have made the finals with Lebron James.\n\nLebron would not want to waste his prime, so would have demanded they trade Okafor, Embiid, Saric and what , 5 future 1st in the next 2 drafts including the Lakers great pick next year top 1 protected and that Kings pick still to come, to surround a fine Noel-Covington-Lebron frontline (Noel a quick rim protector, Covington is a nice fit as the Richard Jefferson/Battier esque 3pt shooting forward) with very competent starting guards and a couple of solid bench guys to round out the rotation.\n\nWould have taken a strong Lebron effort but I think he'd have beaten the Raps in 6 or 7 assumng those trades aren't mishandled. \n\nThe only team I could see being unable to beat Detroit, Atlanta or Toronto would have been Brooklyn, since they'd have damn near no assets to get good guards to go with a fine Lopez-Lebron-ThadYoung frontline. And even then, the Celtics 2017 pick (could they have even traded that legally?) and the far in the future Nets 1sts would have probably gotten them at least some Courtney Lee and  type motherfuckers to give Lebron just enough help to heroically drag his team to the finals and lose in 4 to the Dubs.||47

I am literally always ready for Star Wars erotica|Rockets|1
Oh shit I forgot about this. Kinda sucks for him cause Steph was in foul trouble|[LAL] Sasha Vujacic|3
Yeah Steph definitely would've had over 22 if he played his normal minutes. He shot 63%. 50% from 3. So the dude wasn't exactly wrong. Curry shot very well.||5
Yep\n\nJust foul trouble and blowout caused Curry not to have the game he should've had.\n\nOne of the many reasons it's so hard to predict games|[LAL] Sasha Vujacic|1
And he has to do it with Jar Jar's voice.||4
Oh im ready and I didnt have to eat an onion so today is great day.|Warriors Bandwagon|10
He dun goofed.|Rockets|6
I think he actually wants to do it, or else he would have said 15 or so instead of 22.||51
The Splash Brothers might as well have not been on the floor for Game 1 and the Cavs lost by 15. Tonight, they had an okay game and it was an absolute blowout. If they have a normal game in Cleveland on Wednesday, the NBA might just call the series. |Supersonics|949
Don't know what you're talking about on Curry and Thompson playing OK games. Did you see their stat lines? They played great and both shot 50% from the 3-point line.\n|Spurs|1
Yeah the games won't be any different in Cleveland. R/NBA being ESPN again as usual.|Warriors|1
If they have a 'normal' game then other players are probably gonna do worse because of the cavs gameplan|Warriors|1
Normally I would agree with you, but both of them have been missing some open shots and if they hit those like they normally do, the Cavs game plan won't really matter. |Supersonics|0
Steph 25 minutes lmao|Warriors|1
Calling a 51 point GS win in Game 3 if they keep up this pace.|Warriors Bandwagon|1
I think the GSW bench doesn't play as well as they have been in the past 2 games. The Warriors might pull out a win, but it'd be on the backs of a great game by the Splash Bros. ||1
Nah, the bench didn't even play that great. Nothing compared to game 1. \n\nThe Cavs just can't play defense.|Bulls|4
With the type of defence cavs play on them, I'm suprised they even manage to take shots.|Suns|1
The bench typically steps up at home but I doubt it'll continue in Cleveland. I think our starting 6 will need to run the show for the next 2 games or else we'll have an even series.|Warriors|2
The Warrior's bench had such a good game in game 1 BECUASE Klay and Steph were on the court. The Cavs were going all in to stop Klay and Steph and daring other players to beat them - which they did. No way Livingston scores 20 with all the attention on him.|[DAL] Brian Cardinal|2
They quietly had good games, Steph went 7/11 or something ridiculous like that. Point being why bother taking tough shots when the rest of your team is wide open |Spurs|2
if the warriors more than double the cavs score in game 3 they should just call it a double win and end it|Warriors|2
You are a dumb fan if you think this is possible.|Warriors|-3
Didn't the Bulls almost do that to the Bucks last years playoffs?\n\n*Edit yeah 120-66.... \n\n|Bulls|4

I mean this entire thread is all about the hyperbole.....|Bulls|6
i know its almost as dumb as thinking a team could go 73-9 or that a player could hit over 400 threes in a season or taking a very clearly not serious comment seriously|Warriors|12
> If they have a normal game in Cleveland on Wednesday, the NBA might just call the series.\n\n\\#didloseby50|Warriors|3
Steph only took 11 shots, he knows he can pass to his teammates because when the Cavs triple and double him they leave the other half of the floor open. Someone said on Twitter that it looked like the Cavs only studied how to guard Steph and Klay, kind of the way it's looking right now|Warriors|3
you thinking 60 point blowout?|Bucks|15
Not in Cleveland. Prob by 15-20 game 3, ~30 in game 4. Would be very surprised if the Cavs win a game the way they're playing.|Warriors|2
Mercy rule |Hawks|7
So what you're saying is Warriors in 3?|Thunder|17
My bookie fell off his stole when I made this bet. |Supersonics|3
I'd say Steph and Klay both had good games today.  They just didn't play and shoot alot.  Their passing/defense/rebounding was on point tonight.|Warriors|446
Curry didn't play good defense at all...he picked up 4 fouls in like 20 min of play.|Heat|1
Combined 8 of 16 from three to back up your point|Warriors|1
Klay's defense on drives to the hoop was great|Warriors|1
those who paid for ads are gonna ask for refunds|Spurs|1
I would say Klay had an amazing game.  His rebounding was on point tonight, constantly fighting under the boards.  Defense wa on point as well.|[GSW] Draymond Green|2
I was astonished to see that Curry out-rebounded everyone on the floor. Extremely efficient|Lakers|3
They were okay, but they were both below their average and Klay especially missed a couple of shots that he should hit. It was definitely an improvement on Game 1 though. That said, if they combine for 50+ on Wednesday like they usually do, then it is going to be really ugly with the way Cleveland is playing. |Supersonics|9
Steph only played 25 min though. If he had played a normal 35, he'd have 25+. He had a pretty good game, just didn't play much.|Warriors|19
He didn't play much because of his poor defensive play leading to foul trouble.|Heat|-14
He didn't play mug because they didn't need him. Had it been a close game, there's no way he only plays 25 min. |Warriors|16
He still would've played 35 minutes if he didn't get into foul trouble. Regardless the dude better not get FMVP he really hasn't done shit.|Heat|-15
Man, you're such a loser. Trolling to get people to talk to you. Sad man...||1
No one on the Warriors to me has a really definitive case for FMVP so far. People saying Draymond because it's recent, but before today it was Shaun (and in the first half of game 1 it was Iguodala). If Curry has some great games in Cleveland and Draymond and Iguodala don't score as much, Curry could definitely be FMVP. The series is probably not even halfway done.|Warriors|3
Shot 7/11 from the field and 4/8 from 3 in 24 minutes tonight.  I think we have different definitions of not doing shit.  At this point Draymond is finals MVP, but to say Steph has been playing poorly is straight up BS.  His 3's were money tonight, and he had some sick drives to the rim. He had 7 first half rebounds in limited minutes.  But ya, he hasnt dont shit smh|[GSW] Draymond Green|12
And because the cavaliers got REKT||23
they weren't the usual splash brothers they were about .25 splash brothers and they blew em out by 30. first game they were nonexistent and they blew them out by 15. Cavs have no chance.|Timberwolves|8
If Klay and Steph are at 100% and they don't win by 120 I'm gonna be seriously disappointed. |[CHI] Michael Jordan|20
Curry foul trouble killed his minutes, but he shot efficiently when he was out there|Warriors|261
When Curry went out in the third and the lead kept growing, I knew it was over. If they make a comeback and you put a well rested Steph Curry on the floor, there's no more comeback.|[MEM] Tony Allen|2
Yep, it was essentially like you had a bench player get 9 rebounds, 4 assists, and 18 points on 64% shooting. ||4
Which is pretty damn good|Warriors|1

Thanks Magic!|Warriors|5
I know Cavs fans used that excuse last year, but the fact that they can't defend, and force Cleveland to run fast (exactly what the Warriors want) made it annoying to hear every time someone would say how that was why they lost.\n\nKyrie and K-Love are individually better players than Delly and TT/Mozgov. But they are terrible players to have in this series.|Thunder|287
I was saying that all off season that having love and kyrie actually would have made the finals worst for them last year.  they are so shitty on defense also the game would be played at a faster pace which only helps the warriors. all this sub did was down vote me and tell me LeBron willed the Cavs to 2 victories. When in reality it was the fact playing delly made the game slow and ugly. Also curry was just God awful for a game and a half. LeBron may have filled the star sheet but he had an eFG % below. 400 which is fucking horrible. |[GSW] Tim Hardaway|2
\xf0\x9f\x98\x82||1
I'm wondering what your thoughts on Irving and Love are now. Genuinely interested||3
I admit, I was wrong about Kyrie. His offense outweighed his defense (which was also decent these past few games). I like him as a player, but I thought he would struggle to keep up this series. \n\nLove wasn't great as a scorer this series, but his rebounding greatly helped them with the comeback. There are better PFs to have against Draymond (who was unstoppable most of yesterday, along with his usual defense), but he stepped up when he needed to. I'm happy for both of them. |Thunder|2
Thanks for responding. I'm not a huge basketball fan and really only watch once the playoffs start so I'm not too great a diagnosing how good players are, especially judging their offensive contributions against their defensive contributions. So this was helpful||2
Yea. They should use the starting 5 from last year and use Kylie and love and frye as the depth they were lacking. |Pacers|5
Last year's finals I was really proud of how cavs gave it their all and how they managed to drag Golden State down to their level. But this year the Warriors have gotten better (beyond going from great to out of this world shooting)  and Kerr has learned a thing or two as well. |[CLE] LeBron James|5
I am embarrassed for the Cavs and feel bad for their fans. They look like a bunch of talented players that thought they didn't need a coach, or practice, or a plan, and it now appears they have given up already. I hope they keep fighting and at least win a couple. Maybe ya'll should give Phil Jackson a try. |[DAL] Jamal Mashburn|1
Nah it's ok we're good|Cavaliers|1
lol|[DAL] Jamal Mashburn|1
They are better but not good enough to beat this team. I would take Westbrook/Ibaka over Irving/Love in nearly every series.|Bulls|53
Yup. Those two are far more versatile and fit their roles way better than Irving and Love. Westbrook and Ibaka can play two ways due to their amazing athleticism.|NBA|1
> I would take Westbrook/Ibaka over Irving/Love in nearly every series.\n\nLiterally every series. Although part of what we're saying here is we'd take Donovan over Lue... or rather a good coach over a not-really-a-real-coach. |Warriors|62
I think that is the biggest thing. The cavs should be able to compete for the championship but the coaching is not there. The west is full of great coaches, but east is weak sauce in that category. I think in reality Lebron is going to be the de facto coach of whatever team he is on, and that does not work out very well. |[DAL] Jamal Mashburn|1
You assume that Lue is the actual coach of the Cavs and not LeBron. |Celtics|1
No, that's exactly what I'm saying. Lue is not really a head coach, and in todays NBA it's just not enough to have an all-time player who's also really smart leading the team. You need another couple sets of sideline and film room eyes and a few more really sharp brains looking for weaknesses and figuring out how to exploit them |Warriors|1
I don't care if the Cavs have the reincarnated Red Auerbach, the team just isn't good enough to beat the Warriors|Bulls|17
I think they get swept. I think with a great coach they win a game. With an all-time coach they win two, maybe three. Good coaching means things like knowing how to throw a team off its game. Look at the WCF, they absolutely threw the Ws off their game and stole a game in Oakland, then all bets were off. Great coaching is what it takes to beat a team as good as the Ws, and while it's still almost certainly not enough to win a 7 game series against them it's probably enough to win a game or two at home.|Warriors|20
They won a game last year with a bad coach and no love or Irving. I think with a great coach they could win the series. I think GS has a better/well though out team built up, but I think it would be competitive enough for the cavs to pull it off. \n\n\n|[DAL] Jamal Mashburn|1
It's certainly could, and that's what it would take to be competitive; a great coach.|Warriors|1
Unfortunately, you also need a good team. Mavs fan here just hoping to see dirk get one more.|[DAL] Jamal Mashburn|1
Word, Ws fan here with a soft spot for Dirk. Cheers!|Warriors|1
But OKC had the personnel to pull it off. I don't think that's a fair example. \n\nMy thoughts on playoffs OKC: nightmare matchup for any basketball team, ever.||20
You're right. I don't think these Cavs beat these Ws in a 7 game series no matter who's coaching, but I think if they had an all-time coach they could still win 2 maybe 3 games, and with a good coach they could win 1 maybe 2 games. Good coaches get good players to play at their best by having a plan and putting them in a position to succeed, which gives them confidence.|Warriors|4
It wasn't just the matchups, though. Donovan called all the right personnel changes in those games they dominated, conceited all the right fouls. The dude made a great game into a dumpster-fest with intelligence and I loved it, and I think we all did to be real, even dubs fans in a weird way. It was good fucking basketball on the underdogs part. Shame they couldn't finish, but it was beautiful while it lasted.\n\nI'll take that series where my team loses but puts the best fight anyone has all season over the series where my team goes 4-0 in every time to win it. A championship is cool, but I watch for the game itself, not the award ceremony. Shit, my niece got an award for graduating 1st grade this year.\n\nIt's the journey, the plays, the teachers, the coaches that make it worth it to a fan. I'm drunk. And a tad sad. And this was a rant. Love you guys!\n\n<3\n\n/rant|Thunder|7
Wait a second...|Bulls|1345
It did|Cavaliers|1
To be fair, Love got a concussion and Irving was forced to play basketball. |Supersonics|2021
Defense. The word you are looking for is defense|[LAL] Sasha Vujacic|6
They still lost game 1 and they were already on the way to a blowout before Love went down. Result would have been the same regardless since Love is a liability defensively.|Lakers|8
Love gets a pass-ish, he was playing terrible ball the past 2 games, and he'd still get abused hard on defense all game. This is sad how far he's come from that 25/15 player.|Bulls|327
He had a pretty good game one though|[MIA] Udonis Haslem|0
He had good offensive numbers but he was getting burned on defense all game, or they forced a switch to open up someone else.|Bulls|3
He defended the pick and roll pretty well. Not great defense but passable and better than most people are giving him credit for. He certainly wasn\'t playing "terrible" ball in game one. **Kyrie** on the other hand, was the one who had a "good" offensive game but played HORRIBLE defense.|[MIA] Udonis Haslem|5
Lol...basketball is a funny game. Easy, but most people don't understand it. So easy to put up stats on a bad team when your the chosen one. Much harder to be the 4th guy on a great team.  Think about that when you want your team to trade for boogie cousins.||0
Let's not pretend the Warriors are the same team from last year.|Cavaliers|1
pretty sure the cavs fans said the same about the cavs||1
Love played alright Game 1. Wasn't a great game, but it wasn't terrible. He did some good things. |Celtics|1
He has always been horrible at defense he is that same player. Not sure what if people were expecting him to magically become good at defense or what. |[GSW] Tim Hardaway|1
How far he's fallen* lel||1
Man looking back on days in Minnesota I thought he would be unstoppable with lebron!\n\nHis time in Cleveland has been so disappointing it's like I don't even know what kind of player he is now |Lakers|1
On the Timberwolves.  I'm a Love fan but it was pretty easy to stack numbers on those teams.  ||1
Love was my favorite player, ran that Rubio/Love pick and pop to death on 2k, I saw a lot of him too, but he just doesn't look like the same player anymore, and it should be easier get less defensive attention.|Bulls|2
Idk he was the first option when he was a 25/12 player. He's not really anymore b|Raptors|2
He was 25/15 guy on a team where he was the 1-5th option. I always thought he was incredibly overated and i still stand by that |Clippers|13
Agreed, no one cared if he was racking up stats when his team was going to lose anyways. |[NYK] Charles Oakley|1
I wouldn't say overrated, but he seems to be for sure a good stats on a bad team player. It just seems like the skills he had just disappeared.|Bulls|3
I think Love is getting the Bosh treatment, being relegated to shooting long range jumpers. Except Bosh adapted much better to that role, in large part because he plays defense and has heart.|[LAL] Kobe Bryant|13
I really hope they trade him. I want to see dominant Kevin Love again, even if it's on a 40 win team.|Raptors Bandwagon|11
Not going to happen. Love is a good example of a decent player on a horrible team. He could rack up numbers when no one cared cause his team was going to lose anyways. Perimeter defense in the east has been horrible this postseason, so he hasn't been exposed. |[NYK] Charles Oakley|9
Plenty of mediocre players rack up counting stats on bad teams, Love is not one of them. On/off efficiency splits don\'t lie, his were insane. \n\nAnyway, I guess he was "decent" enough to play crunch time for team USA in the last gold medal game vs Spain. ||3
Maybe the shoulder injury has done him in. He doesn't look good now, that is for sure. \n\nEdit: it definitely has. I think this is why he has been relying on his 3 game so much. Fuck Olynyk|[NYK] Charles Oakley|2
I thought he looked good in game 1. Had some really nice post moves and it didn't appear anyone on GS could effectively guard him. Not a super star by any means, but more than mediocre. |[DAL] Jamal Mashburn|2
Looking at his stats I don't see the difference that I see when I watch his game, which is a lack of tenaciousness and finishing touch. I feel like I used to see Love get his own rebound more often |[NYK] Charles Oakley|1
The past two games? I thought he did well in Game 1. Also, Love averaged 25/15 back when he was the main guy for Minnesota, I wouldn't expect him to do that now. |Spurs|81
Never averaged 25/15. 20/15 in '10-'11 and 26/12.5 in '13-'14.|Timberwolves|2
Fair enough,  but I think my point still stands though.  You expect some drop off stat wise when you go from the main guy to the number three option. |Spurs|0
He put up good numbers but he's still getting abused hard on defense. I know he was the main guy and now the third option but he doesn't even resemble that same player anymore, he's timid and doesn't look for his shot as much.|Bulls|41
Oh,  I totally agree about the defense. Honestly,  I thought the whole offensive "slump" was desired - in the sense that not only are you the third option,  but we\'re going to rely on you to focus on the things that don\'t show up in the stat sheet. But maybe that\'s me. |Spurs|7
That's the thing, it seems like Love contributes 2 things: scoring and rebounds. He's not a crazy good passer except for his outlets, he's not a good ball handler or creator, he can't create his own shot, he's not super quick. He legit just doesn't fit in with Cleveland, and its so strange. Love was my favorite player, I was upset when he went to Cleveland, but its even more upsetting to not be that same player anymore.|Bulls|23
They also got rid of a player that would could help them more now and be better for them in the long term to get Love|[SAS] Tim Duncan|6
Maybe he needs to go back to being chubby |Warriors|52
I'd argue he had his best year (26/12.5/4) after he dropped the weight.|Timberwolves|1
Sorry, thought the tongue in cheek was obvious. I do miss chubby Kev though. |Warriors|4
Haha yeah thought it may have been tongue-in-cheek, but thought it couldn't hurt to give extra info either way. Regardless, his rebounding numbers were best when he was chubby!|Timberwolves|2
Worked for Shaq.||1
A Cavs fan suggested that. He doesn't seem to play as well in the post or work for boards as much anymore.|Bulls|26
They're paying Tristan Thompson an ass-ton of money to do that, but only one of them has the ability to stretch defenses from beyond the arc. |Bulls|18
It's funny because the only 3 he's hit was after being bonked on the noggin.|Celtics|3

Portland would have gotten whooped by a healthy Clippers team. There's a reason why they only won 44 games.|Raptors|2

Healthy clippers would have given the warriors a run.|Warriors|39
Isn't this the same team that lost to the rockets with a 3-1 lead? LOL Clippers are the new cavs. Excuses cause they can never make it to a series with the warriors so can hide behind that. Warriors will have to beat every team by 30 4-0 and still wont get any respect.||-7
Lol bruh a warriors fan said that|[LAC] Chris Paul|2
a run of 4 games you mean?|NBA|3
Lol the Warriors are "lucky they avoided the Clippers and Spurs." |Clippers|9
Holy shit the reactionary....||7
no way. Portland got the benefit of CP3/BG injury and Curry injury. The Warriors were good, but def a step down without Curry||33
With a Love injury and Kyrie playing like garbage and defending terribly, Portland would have a fighting chance IMO.|Trail Blazers|0
idk, that's discrediting the Cavs a lot. It'd be a solid series, anyways.|Clippers|3
Yeah it would go 6, maybe 7 depending on how hot Dame was shooting|[SAS] Tim Duncan|1
I wouldnt go as far as Portland. The top 4 seeds, healthy, sure.|Jazz|53
Portland could beat them in 7. It'd come down to defensive effort (not talent, effort) and how well Dame was shooting|Warriors|-1
Portland beat em by 30 this year. As good as that team was clicking down the stretch and as good as they played GS in the second round I think portland could take it 6 or 7 games |[POR] Brian Grant|2
Portland is always a 4 seed||3
Yeah, Portland would take a game or two from them if Lillard/McCollum got hot, but there's no way that they could defend the Cavs over the course of a series. |Supersonics|15
Really glad I attempted to convert my gf into an NBA fan during the WCF and not the Finals. |[LAL] Magic Johnson|8

Where is good ole u/DeanBlandino when you need him to cherry pick information to make the East look equal to the West?||22
What does GSW winning at home have to do with anything?|Cavaliers|-19
It has to do with winning the Finals, right?|Warriors|9
No reason to worry until you lose at home.|Cavaliers|-9
You know that the Cavs have to win a road game to win this series, right?|Warriors|6
Yeah... and when you lose a home game, you should worry.|Cavaliers|-9
But the Cavs are healthy this time|Warriors|435
ayyyy|Supersonics|1
kevin love aint even good at basketball|Warriors|7
You damn right. |Knicks|2
I don't think people realized how poor Love and Irving are on defense. |Cavaliers|14
We do realize but you swept the east practically with those holes in your team. Which says how bad the east is|Warriors Bandwagon|18
They also have Ty Lue as their coach, something I think people are finally starting to realize is devastating to the Cavs. I truly don't think he was ever qualified to lead a team to the Championship in the first place. It seemed like a ridiculously reactionary move, with more focus on chemistry than basketball. Warriors are still outclassing them in every facet though, including coaching.|Knicks|40
That and the warriors are a lot better this year too. |[SAS] Tim Duncan|2
Ain't the coaching. It's the complete lack of depth and comparative skill. |[NYK] Charles Oakley|2
east coast sucks. clippers woulda swept the cavs|Warriors|9
We woulda swept the Warriors too. They got lucky that they didn't meet us or the Spurs this postseason. They wouldn't stand a chance.\n\nEdit: You guys legit couldn't see the sarcasm? Not even with a Doc Rivers quote reference and an absurd statement? Smh.|Clippers|-18
OKC played one hell of a series and were a few shots short of being in the finals. Based on the Warriors resilience in coming back from 1-3 I don't think any team could have swept them per se. It's not a guaranteed win vs a good west coast team, but it would have been a good series vs healthy Clippers. \n\nCavs finals is so boring to watch.|Warriors|10
I thought I laid the sarcasm pretty thick, but I do agree with you. It would have been a solid series that I'd be willing to see.|Clippers|1
it's /r/nba and the Clippers are actually a solid team that plays great basketball. More importantly, it's /r/nba\n\nI know that people on here are dumb as fuck because I'm dumb af and I post regularly.|Warriors|2
U got downvoted because people STILL fucking believe that the east is on par or barely below par|Warriors Bandwagon|9
No way the east is way above par in comparison to the west.|Spurs|1
Apparently the east has the best team in the league ahaha|Cavaliers|2
So sweet isn\'t it. "Cleveland would\'ve lost to Portland"|Cavaliers|2

Meh, I\'m done with the NBA.  Momentum is shut down by refs to keep tight games.  As much as it creates "excitement" due to the score being close, it\'s a false excitement, and you can see how frustrating it is for the players.|[NYK] Charles Oakley|1
Draymond Green just put this entire subreddit on suicide watch.|Lakers|1312

The hate makes it so much more satisfying knowing that the haters are sitting at their keyboards with nothing to type right now.|Warriors|5

I love it. Early on but it's looking like he has a shot at Finals MVP? Imagine the salt if he does|Warriors|499
He's definitely getting finals mvp if/when they win||0
You could open a McDonald's with it|Bucks|1
Iguodala won't let it slip away, lol||2
I personally want Iggy to get it again. 5 players to win back to back finals MVP: Lebron, Kobe, Shaq, Jordan, Olajuwon. If Iggy makes that list, it'll be so special. He's not the star of the team, and he would've won it from the defensive end. |Warriors|4
I will be slightly upset because it means Iguodala will not win Finals MVP.|76ers|6
The best outcome possible is Livingston FMVP, if I'm being honest|Warriors|15
It really depends now right. Who knows who's going to step up for game 3. We could be looking at Finals MVP Ian Clark. |Clippers|7
I'm thinking more about how the Warrior haters will start critiquing Steph for not being the Finals MVP in either of the Finals he's been in.|Lakers|259
Steph knows it wouldn't be fair to win the MVP and FMVP in the same year|Warriors|1
Which I think would be a fair critique. |Warriors|1
To be fair that's taken into context with every great player. MJ, Shaq, Kobe, LBJ, all of them. It's a big deal at the end of the day but irrelevant too. |Mavericks|2
True, I've mostly heard it said against other great players. And since you're more or less nitpicking at that point, it's fair.|Lakers|1
Can't really be Curry's fault that they are so dominant that they don't need him to play. Not that his haters will take note of that.||2
He should have gotten it last year in my opinion(not to diminish what iguodala did). Realistically doesnt matter to most people. His impact on the game is very apparent. |Warriors|26
Nah, green dominated last year.||-5
Green was good but Steph had all the offense in the games that mattered. Besides his one bad game early in the series, he took over offensively and made the big shots. |Warriors|15
Listen, I'm not a judge or a basketball expert, but I do rememeber the finals last year and all I remember was Green going terminator on the Cavs.||1
Then you should remember iggy smothering lebron off of the bench as well. His defense was god like in Game 5 and Game 6.|Warriors|1
Ya, I rememeber that too, but we were discussing green getting mvp over curry.  The grass is green and the sky is blue...||1
Yup iggy did great on LeBron but the series was over once curry found his shot. He had a horrible game 2 and half of game 3 after that he was amazing. If he has a mediocre game 2 the series probably only goes 5. LeBron may have filled the stat sheet but he was under .400 on eFG% |[GSW] Tim Hardaway|1
I agree. I commented this about Curry's Finals a while back. I'd also like to add that Iguodala did **not** defend LeBron by himself. The Warriors threw the whole team at him because the Cavs had no shooting. No way can Iggy shut LeBron down by himself.\n\nA) It was his first Finals\n\nB) He was getting hard trapped 30 feet away from the basket on every pick & roll so all he did was make the smart outlet pass to Draymond every time to help his team actually... you know, win.\n\nC) He still averaged 26ppg on very efficienty 58.5% true shooting, more than 2ppg more than his season average & career high in the regular season\n\nD) He averaged 4.2 made 3's in the Finals which was more than his career high & record setting regular season average of 3.6 made threes per game\n\nE) It was a joke that Iggy won Finals MVP. He was literally standing wide open for the entire series and managed to his some 3's and average 16ppg while giving up (admittedly unefficient) 36-13-9 to LeBron. Try going for 26-5-6 with two steals while being double teamed the entire series. Curry or LeBron should have won Finals MVP.|NBA|2
I agree with you. \n\nPeople remember it differently.|Warriors|1
LeBron really should've been the Finals MVP last year.|[SAS] Tiago Splitter|17
Nah, you don't give it to a losing team. Just like the regular season MVP doesn't go to a player who's team didn't make the playoffs.|Raptors|1
He shot under .400 in eFG% that is ducking horrible. I don't care how many points he got. |[GSW] Tim Hardaway|1
No way. Iguodala definitely earned it last year and I'm glad he got it. I was afraid they were just going to give it to Steph just because he's Steph.|Trail Blazers|67
Iguodala had a great impact but it could have easily gone to Steph. He literally hit the biggest shots down the stretch and everyone thought he had a bad series because of one game. \n\nBecause of that narrative that stuck for some reason, he was basically out of the running. Iguodala definitely had a good series overall and a great one defensively. |Warriors|35
I feel that the off-ball impact is underrated. Curry is an elite scorer so imagine all the energy that goes into guarding him, especially this finals series. Him being on the floor improves the play of his teammates just from the defense and energy required to limit him. Then there are the stats.\n\nHowever, I would give MVP to Klay because I think it should be awarded for playoffs not just finals, and Klay deserves it as much as Curry I think. Thinking of game 6 vs OKC.||28
Klay has been the shit this playoffs - but finals MVP is for the final series so we need to see who makes it happen against the cavs||0
>Him being on the floor improves the play of his teammates just from the defense and energy required to limit him.\n\nAgreed.  Curry could score just a handful of points and still be the most valuable player on the floor.  When he runs a PNR, both defenders are glued to him and Green gets to have a completely free 4v3.  Steph gets no stat there, but the play only develops like that because Steph puts the fear of God into his opponents.  \n\nHe warps defenses to a greater degree than any player in league history.  It's crazy to watch.  There's at least a couple times per game where Steph will be off ball, and set a down screen for a teammate.  Both defenders will stick with Steph even though he's the guy setting the screen, and the teammate will literally just run wide open to the basket and get a layup with no defender within 10 feet.||1
Just say more. Klay has been better than Curry these playoffs he literally saved his team game 6. Game 4 they made it a game for a bit when he scored 18 in a quarter. |Thunder|11
I dont know why our fans have auch a hard time admitting that steph hasnt been our best player for most of our games.\n\nAnd thats okay because its a reason why our team chemistry is so incredible, anyody can pick up the slack.|Warriors|1
Yup. I think if the Thunder grab another consistent shooter in the offseason that's all we need and another offseason for our guys to improve. But the Warriors depth makes them special and Klay takes the #2 but Steph he's a #1 talent as well on the right night. |Thunder|1
If you only watch Curry for a number of possessions, you really see the impact he has on every other defender on the floor. |Warriors|9
Look at how many wide open shots green had last night because they had 2 guys following curry|[GSW] Tim Hardaway|1
Not understanding that the W is bigger than the box score, or an award. Silly of them|Warriors|10
He\'s a big moment kind of player, shows up when his team needs him, sparks those runs that erase 15 point deficits. He\'s hardly needed to get out of bed yet in this series. Who knows, it might be a different story in Cleveland, but I\'m totally fine if he cruises through the finals the way "the King" cruises through the regular season.|NBA|17
The Thunder series proved this isn't always true. It was moreso Klay that pushed the Warriors out of the 3-1 hole||1
I don\'t like his attitude. But if anybody thinks he\'s a bad player... **they\'re** blind. He has some loose screws, but he\'s a GREAT player. \n\nIf he had a Tim Duncan attitude towards people everybody would be "I want him in my team"\n\nSorry for the shitty English.\n\nPS: Thanks /r/the_marcorubio|Heat|100
His attitude is what makes him so valuable to the Warriors. He's somewhere in between KG and Matt Barnes. Great teammates and you love them on your team but if he's not on your team you hate his guts.\n|Knicks|1
Your English is fine. The only thing I\'d change is say "then *they\'re* blind" instead of "he\'s blind", since the way you wrote it sounds like you\'re calling Draymond blind.||1
Everyone still wants him on their team. I don\'t have a problem with him, and I would love him on the Spurs, but if anyone tells you, "I wouldn\'t take Draymond!", they are lying to themselves.|[SAS] Sean Elliott|1
Your English is good :)|Cavaliers|2
Absolutely nothing wrong with your English bro|Heat|3
His defensive footwork is outstanding. He rarely gets beat on fakes or crossovers.|Warriors|2
But his attitude is part of what makes him great. He gets everyone fired up. Unfortunately he takes it too far sometimes. He needs to take a page out of KG's book and keep it cleaner.|Warriors|18
That\'s exactly it. I loved that fighting spirit last season as a neutral, but this year it just went overboard and the no calls piled up. Far too Steph threes preceded by blatant moving screens or even fighting screens. \n\nStill, had he had the humility to just go "my bad, that was too far, but I\'ll always fight for my team" I probably would have had nothing but respect for him. |Celtics|-2
KG was always a dirty player. Do you not remember when he hit frye In the nuts?|Warriors|6
But plays like that were few and far between. Right now it looks like Green is doing it like every other game.|Warriors|1
KG was pretty well known for headbutts, elbows, fights, hitting dudes in the balls and taking his trash talking too far. I'm not complaining about KG I'm just saying that taking a page out of his book is probably not the best idea to keep it clean. |Warriors|1
You're crazy if you don't want him on your team. I'd take him on my team any day of the week and I will enjoy every salty reaction towards him. You think Celtics fans gave a fuck that Garnett was a piece of shit when he joined them? Fuck no. That's a straight up baller and winner right there.|Lakers|8

I still don't understand how anyone in their right mind thought signing JR Smith was a good idea after watching him play in NY.|NBA|22
He plays lights out amazing until the finals.  He just fucking disappears.  I have no idea what his deal is.|Cavaliers|14
The deal is JR is good until the pressure ramps up, then he is a mewling babe. |[NYK] Charles Oakley|2
Better defense is part of it. They aren't passing the ball like they were earlier in the playoffs also which helps the role players more.|Timberwolves|10
GM LeBron needed a soft ass 3-point specialist, Mike Miller retired, so he got J.R. Smith.|[MEM] Mike Bibby|36

Firing Blatt and repalcing him with Lue is really rasing some questions right now... Because he is getting outcoached by a mile and the team looks way less prepred than last year |Bulls|1112
Agreed and they should. Firing a coach who got you to the finals a year ago and was winning games this season has repercussions to be dealt with and I think we are seeing that play out as we speak. ||1
I couldnt believe they fired him when they did.  They were in 1st place in the eastern conference (I think) and coming off a championship.  I could understand making a change if they lost again this year (...kinda...) but it wasn't fair to Blatt to give up on him so early.  I just take Blatt more seriously as a coach than Lue...Lue just keeps getting stepped over in all of his Finals appearances.  Comparing the two's track records...its like AAU vs NBA|[GSW] Draymond Green|2
I think Blatt and Lue were set up for failure in a way. Both got thrust into roles they really weren't prepared for. Blatt would have done better as assistant in a LeBron James Cleveland team or the head coach of a bubble-ish team like the Wizards or Pacers (after 2013). Instead he got a lot more limelight than he signed up for. Give him some time to get to used to the NBA way.\n\nLue had quite a bit of experience before, but he basically got saddled with a ton of responsibility and pressure halfway through the season. Not nearly enough time for a transition.|Pacers|3
I've always protected Blatt and obviously not many people believe me but he's the better coach. I can image he's smiling a bit when he sees the outcome of this game.|Lakers|2
Honestly I don't know. To me this series hasn't looked at all like the Cavs are getting outcoached. Personally, I think the Warriors are just a far superior team, the Cavs just need to play perfect and the Warriors need to play bad for them to win.|Cavaliers|13
I think you guys had to get rid of Blatt eventually...I think he's a good coach he just needs a team of young guys to mold and yell at not lebron and older vets.  I agree though I think the Warriors are a better team at every position aside from SF||4
Ehh, I'm really just a Lebron fan so if he wasn't there I couldn't care less about the Cavs tbh.|Cavaliers|1
Same here ||1
I'm kinda hoping he leaves tbh.|Cavaliers|2
The warriors are a better team, but all regular and playoff season stats point to a better Cavs team as well. If you believe in the Elo-score, this should've been a closer series than last year's. \n\nObviously, this doesn't take into account some of the intangibles. Like coaching.||5
Idk man this is arguably the greatest team of all time vs Lebron and some good players.|Cavaliers|0
Lue is horrible... You look at the comparison on offense playcalling and movement and it's just not even close. Then you look at the rotations and matchups and it's even worse.||23
Lue looked like he wanted to take a nap in the late 4th quarter. Absolutely no coaching or enthusiasm shown. Ben Carson would have have shown more emotion.|Pelicans|3
Not really. I don't  blatt would've went with the correct strategy last year. Injuries forced him into it .||3
Nah GS is just a clearly superior team and anyone that thought the Cavs were something special for getting through the East is just an idiot. ||3
I'd love to be a fly on the wall in the Blatt household right now|NBA|3
Lue looks clueless in this series. Almost like he planned on trying to let Lebron just carry them to a championship...||3
It's another case of LeBron hamstringing himself.  He led the charge to get rid of Blatt and now he is well on his way to losing in the finals again whilst Curry has replaced him in all of the Jordan comparison articles and videos.|Supersonics|5
But Lue told LeBron to stfu - clearly he's a better coach?|76ers|5
This reminds me of how Coach Thorpe said on Zach Lowe's podcast that he thinks they should've kept Blatt so they had a scapegoat in case they get beaten bad in the Finals.|Lakers|7
To be fair that may just speak to Kerr's goodness|Warriors|26
Warriors goodness in general. Thwyre just a nightmare matchup for the cavs. With that said , lue has definitely put out some weak rotations |Heat|28
looks a lot like the warriors under jackson|Warriors|307
So what you're saying is that the Cavs should hire Steve Kerr|Lakers|4
Kerr\'s first question: "So where do you keep your Steph Curry?"|Warriors|13
Gilbert: "We can get you a Seth Curry, will that do?"|Mavericks|2
Gilbert: "don\'t worry Kerr, we have....... Mo williams" |Lakers|3
While I agree with this sentiment, it's hilarious how before this series started, all the top voted comments were about how Lue was getting this Cavs team to play way better than Blatt ever did. 2 losses later and the bandwagon is completely in the other camp.||754
I like to imagine the bandwagon is a lot like the bus in Speed, and it constantly needs to be moving lest we all die! |Timberwolves|3
I also loved how people were using the Cavs performance in the east as a reason as to why they'd be able to go toe to toe with the warriors. |NBA|10
Exactly. Gsw have a complete team, an MVP, excellent bench players and coach... the best players Cleveland has seen so far are Drummond,  Millsap,  Derozan and Lowry.  Beating them does not make you qualified to beat the warriors, or even okc imo. |Knicks|5

Well that's basically what is said every playoff series Lebron's team loses/is losing in.|Warriors|10
Has there ever been a team ever, pro or otherwise, that won a championship the same year they fired a coach?  I ask this knowing that there could very well be, I honestly have no idea, but I would be surprised if there were.\n\n*to add to this, has a team that ever fired a coach made the final round of whatever tournament they play?  I can't even think of that example.||17

Well in Turkish soccer league Galatasaray won the championship the same year they fired their coach and they fired him post halfway then couldn\'t find a coach, our assistant coach(who was fairly young and didn\'t have much experience) and training stuff "coached" our players was an awesome season. |Warriors Bandwagon|1
Boooooo.  Go Kara Kartal!|Pistons|0
Wait, Warriors did it last year!||2
I think he meant fired a coach mid-season. Seems like a disastrous thing to do, when you consider that the new coach didn't get to oversee training camp and install their own principles.|Warriors|2
> Has there ever been a team ever, pro or otherwise, that won a championship the same year they fired a coach?\n\nThere's at least 2 in soccer that won the Champions League, Zidane did it with Real Madrid this year, and Roberto di Matteo coached Chelsea in 2012 - that one was similar to Lue actually, started out as the assistant and got promoted to head coach after they fired the previous guy.|Celtics Bandwagon|7
Real didn't win the championship, they won the Champions league.|[LAL] Smush Parker|1
I think the Lakers did with Pat Riley in '82|[GSW] Baron Davis|11
It would seem that you are right.  Even if the exact titles surrounding the switch are somewhat up in the air.  Interesting tidbit, there.\n\nAt any rate, that doesn\'t seem to be the "championship" formula.||1
Yeah - I suspect the championship-winning records of teams that switched coaches midway through a season is...not so good. |[GSW] Baron Davis|1
How about the Heat in '06 with Pat Riley firing SVG and taking over?\n|Lakers|13

I feel like Lue should have been the coach last year and Blatt this year.\n\nLue has made everyone get along and trust each other. Blatt couldnt. But now that theyre all friends, you need Blatts tactical ability.||61

I mean, that's what everyone was saying prior to the playoffs even starting that the WCF was the true finals.

I think a split at Cleveland is a realistic hope for the two games. |Pistons|2

Thunder would have easily beat this Cavs team|Warriors|18
Oh really?|NBA|1
undoubtedly. Warriors were running on empty after the OKC series, they didn't play well enough to win against any top team in the finals|Warriors|1
We match up a lot better against OKC than against GSW.  That series would be more competitive than you think.|Cavaliers|9
could you win though?|Warriors|13
Yes|Cavaliers|0
Instead of a 30pt blowout it would be a 29pt blowout |[LAL] Nick Young|24
I think it just got less exciting once the Thunder were eliminated. Rooting for the Cavs just doesn't really make sense (as a non-cavs fan), even though they have yet to have won a championship.\n\nI think Cavs will fight a bit, maybe win a game, but really this series was kinda over as soon as GSW won the conference finals. The Cavs team relies pretty heavily on LeBron to do most of the work while others just stand around or rebound.|Lakers|127
I honestly think everyone would root for the Cavs if they didn't have LeBron... Underdog status for a team whose city has not won a major championship since 1964, fighting hard every year but can't win, taking down the unstoppable.\n\n\nIt's something about how unlikeable LeBron is, and how the world is in love with Steph and his family, the Splash Bros., etc||1
I don't think the Cavs would have made the finals without Lebron...||1
yeah, I meant like same situation (them in the finals) just without LeBron, however realistic it may not be\n||1
[removed]||2
Ahahaha lol, gg for you guys. My thoughts were on game 2, but who knew they would come out with fire for the rest of the series? Props to Lebron and Kyrie specially for closing down that stretch.|Lakers|1
I just really disagree, maybe it's because I'm a big nfl fan and the browns are just so sad, but I really want Cleveland to get one. |Celtics|2
I hope Cavs win a game so the Warrios can close out at home.|Warriors|2
I was under the impression that the Cavs were some transformed, small ball jump shooting team and would give the Warriors hell. I was even worried about that because all the "analysts" were saying the previous matchups don\'t even matter because this revitalized team was so good. \n\nHonestly last year\'s depleted Cav\'s team made the finals a hell of a lot more competitive.|Warriors|7

Ball don't lie||1
I suspect almost every team without a head coach right now to try their best to hire Blatt, this series makes you appreciate the offense that Blatt implemented to make the players around LeBron better||8
He already signed with darussafaka for 2 years||3
He already got a job with a team in Turkey |Celtics|3
Sadly, no. He\'s taken a job in Turkey, after waiting and getting no interest in the NBA. [Article](http://www.cleveland.com/pluto/index.ssf/2016/06/cleveland_cavaliers_have_terry_54.html). But I bet he\'s awfully satisfied tonight...or whenever morning is in Turkey.\n\nSad for the Cavs, the whole situation. Granted, a good bit of blame may be on him for "losing the team." But he had proven, elite level, coaching knowledge. Something Lue seemingly, and fittingly, doesn\'t have as a first year coach.||13
Rather unfortunate for Blatt, his basketball IQ level was severely unappreciated. As a Knick fan, I wanted him as the head coach (happy with the Horny situation we have ;)). Having LeBron on your team causes most sports fans and analysts to downplay your importance as a coach, best of luck to Blatt||10
I'm ready to listen to an insane rant about how the coming Jewish-American political in-fighting (look at who Bernie chose for the platform committee at the DNC) was personified by Gilbert vs. Blatt. ||5
After they fired him I remember thinking "I hope this bites them" feeling pretty vindicated. \n\nAlso Lakers fan here so obglitory "Fuck Dan Gilbert"|[LAL] Kobe Bryant|13
This dude had the Cavs up 2-1 in last years finals having Love and Irving physically absent due to injuries.....and they fired him|Spurs|20
Seriously, that contract for Lue is looking incredibly foolish right now.\n\nEdit: I guess he didn't sign the contract? Still, Lue does not seem like the upgrade over Blatt he was made out to be.|Cavaliers|195
If you could pick a coach for next season, realistically, who would it be?|Knicks|1
Fortunately that's not my decision to make. I thought Blatt was great and was really taken aback when he was fired. The Eastern conference playoffs helped me forget that but it's all coming back to me now. Unfortunately, if the Cavs do want to make a coaching change, all of the really good candidates are gone.\n\nOr maybe we're all just overreacting. I mean, this is a historically good Warriors team we're up against. However, the Cavs simply are not executing to the same level they were earlier in the playoffs and they're getting outcoached at every step of the way. I actually thought that the Cavs got outcoached against Detroit as well, it just helped that Cleveland was a better team.|Cavaliers|2
i'm hoping and expecting the cavs to be a little better at home. i thought the Blatt firing was a bit harsh, although we don't know what it was like in that locker room, did not seem to be popular with the players at all. Before Hornacek there was rumours of Blatt being hired with by the knicks. I would have been happy with that. Then again after the last two coaches i'd be happy with just about anyone.|Knicks|2
The more I think about it, the more I start to realize that the Cavs may not need a new coach, but more veteran leadership. Richard Jefferson has been a great addition to this team because he's been there and done that. He doesn't get fazed and if his Snapchat is any indication, he's been a great locker room guy as well. But besides him and LeBron, there are no other good veteran players on the team. If the Cavs could find another solid vet with some playoff experience to bring off the bench I think that could help the team more than anything else.|Cavaliers|2
I think what Cleveland really needs is \n\nA) a coach who will not bow to Lebron. A coach who will work with Lebron, of course, but also someone that can *coach* him. Obviously James doesn't need to be coached as we traditionally think about it, but he has to listen to the coach when it comes to rotations, running plays and other Xs and Os type stuff. When Lebron goes off script he can be brilliant, but that doesn't work if he doesn't have complimentary pieces surrounding him.\n\nB) The Cavs need a big off season move. As a unit, Lebron, Love and Kyrie are not cohesive and will not win a championship. I think most would agree Love is the guy to trade, as he and Lebron essentially play the same position (though Lebron hates playing the 4 even tho Cavs have some of their best success when he's at that spot). Aside from that, it's clear that Lebron/Love hasn't gelled into anything and as bad as Kyrie's defense is, I don't think you want to give up what he provides on offense. I'm not really sure what Cleveland could get for Love, as his stint on the Cavs has probably hurt his rep as a player, but he could probably be an amazing reclamation project for someone like Rick Carlisle. Love needs to be on a team that has a plan for him and a coach that knows how to get the best out of him. I'd love to see Kevin go somewhere like Portland (Stotts + Dame + CJ + Love sounds like at least a second round playoff team to me) or Boston. He could probably find a spot and provide some vet leadership on a team like Utah, Phoenix or Orlando, teams that have assets that they are willing to part with.\n\nWhatever happens, I think the great Cleveland experiment is dead and this team will look significantly different next year, because there is no way, *no way in hell* this Cavs team wins four of the next five games. They'll be lucky to avoid a sweep.|Supersonics|1
Would you say defence is an issue too? having two important guys like Love and Kyrie who are known to struggle defensively is tough.|Knicks|2
I really don't think so. The defense looked really good in the first half last night, they just can't score efficiently right now. Kevin Love has looked especially good on defense all throughout these playoffs.|Cavaliers|1
I know he doesn't actually have a contract, but honestly, what does a coaching contract matter?  It's not like it goes against the cap.  They can fire him at any time and just pay him off.  It makes a ton of sense to give a coach at least the impression of job stability to make the players think he's really in charge long term.  |Warriors|1

I haven't felt good about the Cavs since the Blatt firing. Normally the universe seems to screw Cleveland, but if the Cavs get swept I'm going to feel as though it was the Cavs who screwed the Cavs. Karma in sports has always seemed like a real thing to me.|Cavaliers|390
So what did karma do this time? :)|NBA|1
lol the Cavs have always been out for the Cavs.||1
Cleveland sports always screw themselves. A lot of it comes from the front office too.|Cavaliers|3
Firing Blatt after one year and expecting immediate success from Lue, who has no head coaching experience at any level to his name to my knowledge, is such a Browns thing to do. What did Cleveland area professional sports ever do to anger the sports gods? God save Francona. ||14
That is a very mature response. The Cav's did not handle that situation well. |Lakers|67
The thing that blew my mind about the situation was that Lue didn't become just an interim, he legitimately became the replacement with a god damn 3 year contract. That's just incredibly foolish to me. There's very little to gain and a lot to lose. A wise organization (although it's kind of contradictory as that type of organization wouldn't fire Blatt midseason) would have just seen how Lue finished out the season and then reevaluate. I guess Gilbert really doesn't care about burning money. |Heat|51

What Lebron did last year should be better appreciated after this year. With almost the same supporting cast and playing against almost the same team (granted GSW has been insane this year, but still), Lebron made it a series with pure will. Dude wasn't crazy efficient, but I've never seen someone play so hard in my entire life.||2
At this point, the only way Lebron is going to get one for The Land is if he clones himself 14 times.|Trail Blazers|219
Shooting 42% on purely layups and dunks while averaging 5.5 TOs per game probably won't get him the win...|Raptors Bandwagon|4
Well when you cant double team all five at once so the fg% goes up and they cant all be the primary ball handler at all times so TOs go down. Now what?|Spurs|5
But only one would iso and drive and the other team could just stack the lane and win...|Raptors Bandwagon|1
Lebrons kicks out of drives are elite and his mid range isn't so broken that you can just leave him open on the perimeter. Besides if the pass hits another slasher then he's scoring or going to the line|Spurs|1

It's not like okc lost to Cleveland. |NBA|2
It was mostly OKC's fault for having the biggest choke of their entire franchise. Seriously, when you have a 3-1 lead, you wanna close it out as soon as possible. Maybe we could excuse them for losing Game 5, but they  never really did adjust properly. I really really wanted OKC to go to the finals and at least compete with the Cavs, as a non-OKC fan. Maybe when he wins a championship in OKC, people will stop debating about LeBron vs. KD stuff. \n\nI guess it could be good if KD stays. This is a new coach, and most of the players were healthy this season, which tells me that they have room to grow and even could be better than last season. LeBron when he came to the Heat also lost in his first season as well, so maybe he has a better chance at staying in OKC than to go anywhere else. But i guess it's up to him to decide about all of this.|Lakers|18

The Cavs were clearly outmatched but I blame this loss ~~solely~~ mostly on Lue. The Cavs had a chance in that third quarter but he puts LeBron at the 5. The Warriors went on a 13-4 run against that lineup but he doesn't make any adjustment whatsoever. He kept on playing LeBron for the entire third quarter and that means LeBron can't start the 4th quarter like usual (and instead Lue puts in Mozgov) - and we know what happened at the start of the 4th quarter.|Knicks|726
I blame the third splash brother||1
So lebron would have been better off with a coach he didn't control? Color me surprised.|Warriors|1

Thompson was in foul trouble, Love out. You want Mozgov in there?|Pistons|1
"Yeah, I can fucking lead this team." \n\nTo the NBA Finals. No further.||1
Truth be told, I don\'t fault Lue for trying that. Going into game 2, I was wondering where the Cavs could get more offense and thought maybe going small with Lebron at the 5 when the Death lineup on the floor could give them enough offense and defense to be competitive. I do fault Lue for not trying the 2 bigs lineup before garbage time though. At some point, you\'re just flinging stuff at the wall and seeing what sticks. Unfortunately for the Cavs, I think they tried that "flinging" stuff too late in the game to get any meaningful information for game 4. \n\nAside from all of that, it\'s clear that the Cavs don\'t trust each other. They\'re very good at playing individual defense or specific matchup defense but very poor at staying focused. I thought the Cabs did a good job in the 1st half of the first quarter. Lots of motion on offense, good transition D. But midway through the second quarter, all the good work was gone, and the rest was history. \n\nI actually think that this Love injury (hope he gets well soon!) can be a blessing in disguise for CLE as they may be able to start Shumpert and his perimeter D and hide Kyrie on Barnes. \n\nI also think that the decline in Lebron James will be harder and sharper than a lot of people think, and we may see it starting next year. James\' jump shot is abysmal, and I don\'t think his game will age well without it. \n\ntl;dr: Cavs are in massive trouble and need to think about hitting the panic button.|Warriors Bandwagon|2
What was worse is when they started the 4th with the big line up. They were already having trouble on the defensive end and they made it worse putting in a slower line up. It was Lue\'s "I\'m all out of options, I don\'t know what else to do" move|Warriors|2
Agreed. Small ball is asking GS to play the Death Lineup. ||3
Can't blame this on Lue -- his plays worked. Delly, JR, Kyrie, Love -- where are the Cavs shooters? Why is LeBron taking the most threes? And forget the start of the 4th -- the lead was 20 heading into the 4th -- Lue is a great coach but the Cavs team isn't confident enough to hit the shots they need to hit|[CLE] Mark Price|35
Lue is a dumb coach...atleast blatt last year was competitive on the road..|Warriors|1
Shumpert had a look for a 3 on one play with the shot clock running down and he passed it to RJ and it was a fucking 24 violation. How the fuck do you turnover on 24. Just throw something up. Shumpert has zero confidence I'm honestly amazed that the Cavs even made it here||1
That's a JV high school move no room for it in the NBA -- Cavs got confidence when crushing teams and lost it when getting blown out -- need to be more emotionally balanced as a team|[CLE] Mark Price|1
Playing lebron at 5 and ignoring rim protection is on Lue. They got our scored by 10 in the 9 minutes curry sat in the 3rd|76ers|1
Ignoring rim protection? That wasn't where we were killed. We got killed in transition, in guys losing their man, and mostly, because we took bad shots and set up their transition. LeBron at the 5 is a very effective lineup that was lauded here earlier and Lue has incredible talent -- the only issue is that the Cavs lack confidence and we need to play with a real hope and determination|[CLE] Mark Price|1
>Why is LeBron taking the most threes?\n\nThat's still partially Lue's fault. Either his gameplan is stupid or he's not reigning in LeBron. |Heat|1
did you watch the game? Lue had plays for each one of our shooters and we had open looks. Delly, Shump, Frye, etc. were all passing up threes. if no one is shooting threes, LeBron is forced to be that guy. Complete dissapointment by a bunch of benchwarmer scrubs|[CLE] Mark Price|1
They matchup really poorly with us. They're playing a team who can actually defend the 3 ball well and it's showing.|[GSW] Wilt Chamberlain|1
To be fair the Warriors D closed out on them so quick, none of them really got any good looks from 3. Other than JR when he's hot and maybe Kyrie/Love at times they can't hit contested 3s. \n\nThey just got straight up outplayed offensively and defensively. |Lakers|3
No, you can definitely blame it on Lue. We played iso the whole game and took terrible shots. Our defensive gameplan was to let them take layups. Both of these fall on coaching.|Cavaliers|4
You mean kyrie played iso the whole game. Kyrie is overrated. I know its a sin to say that here in NEO, but its true. He isn't a pg and never will be a super star. If he isn't traded, the cavs will never will a championship. ||1
Irving is only 24, man, hes got a long time to improve|NBA|2
This Cavs team looks shook. It's one thing to be 0-2, and another when they aren't even competing out there.\n\nI don't think blowing out the eastern conference did them any favors. I'm not sure they really know how to respond to adversity. They just ran into a brick wall.|Trust The Process|7
You mean that play where he tells his max deal stretch four to go sit in the corner?|[MIL] Andrew Bogut|12
Fuck that. Cavs haven't had a chance since this series started. They have to work so fucking hard to get a contested layup, while GSW just runs off ball screens looking for easy backdoors and open shots. GSW would have to suddenly get legendary bad at hitting open shots to lose a game this series. |[NYK] Charles Oakley|6

Remember that LeBron is responsible for Lue being coach, and for the players around him. \n\nThis is his team, through and through, and if they're not showing up, it's because the GM didn't do his job and let it be dictated by someone who already has his own job to do.|Kings|2
Part of the reason they didn't try is undoubtedly because they know their coach has nothing. They can still be competitive for a game if they all individually play at the top of their games, but they're right to have zero confidence their coach can put them in a position to win this series. It's beyond chess vs. checkers, it's go vs. connect four. |Warriors|2
What did LeBron do? He was terrible too... RJ the only guy who showed up|Warriors|8
Lebron had a great 1st quarter. Decent 2nd and 3rd as he started to be more aggressive.|Lakers|5
He was 0-5 but he definitely filled up the rest of the stat sheet\n\nEdit: in the 1st I mean|Warriors|4
Yeah he had 4 steals and 5 assists in the first quarter or something along those lines|Lakers|5
Yeah those steals had a huge impact in the first.\n\nTheir main thing is that his drives/post ups were leading to open threes in previous series though and they're not getting those looks anymore... Lue gonna have to step it up before game three |Warriors|4
You also need your assistants and scouts to help him out. I had hope for the Cavs after the first quarter and that disappeared mid 2nd quarter|Lakers|3
He actually tried. Put effort into at least doing SOMETHING|Wizards|20
At least 2 of Lebron's TOs were due to someone just not catching a simple pass.|[GSW] Stephen Curry|7
more than that, kyrie had 2-3 on his own and JR had one|76ers|1
That's true, can't say that dude doesn't care|Warriors|6
LeBron isn't playing like the best player on the league.  Dude is one of the most dominating players; yet, almost got a quad-triple double with turnovers.||3
Why does this seem to happen every finals with LeBron?  It feels like the pressure is so high and people rely more and more on LeBron telling them what to do so they don't fail or something.  I'm not a huge LeBron fan,  but I do feel bad and that his team sure fails him when he needs them most. Old man Ray Allen was the only one helping him his 4th year in the heat. |Suns|16
Why aren\'t you a lebron fan? I\'ll never understand this. Did people back in the day actually say "I\'m not an MJ fan, but" "I\'m not a Magic fan, but".. just appreciate watching one of the best to do it before it\'s over.\n\nBut I agree, his teams always find a way to let him down, however, this warriors team is also amazing|Suns|-3
I think LeBron is the best player in the world and he is amazing, but for one I always viewed him as a rival to Kobe. And for two I feel like the media has been shoving him down our throats for his whole career. And it's weird how it is a bad thing to hate LeBron, people hated Kobe and people hated MJ and Malone,  and Isaiah Thomas, and hated Celtics/Lakers etc.  \n\nBut they act like LeBron was the first hated player.  Sure,  LeBron has had more hate than he deserves,  but the constant media excusing and defense of him turns me off. \n\nAnd to clarify, I don't hate him,  I just am not a fan of his,  and I would rather watch Curry play if I had the choice.  |Suns|5
Well, last year injuries happened and he also played great so people gave him a pass.  He won 2 out of 4 with the Heat, losing as the favorite in 2011 to the Mavs but winning in 2013 when they probably should have lost to San Antonio.  So that 2 out of 4 is probably about right.  His previous trip to the Finals in 2007, he carried a good but not great Cavs team.  \n\nI mean, it doesn't actually happen every Finals with him.  It's not like he's ringless.  And this Warriors team is an all time great and was so last year as well.  I don't really have a point here except that this narrative that Lebron has no help in the Finals is really just a narrative and nothing more.  His teams have only been favored twice in the Finals IIRC.  ||2
Partly because Lebron *is* just so dominant - it's easier to take shots or drive and miss when you didn't have Lebron has an option to go to and turn down.||7
Hey now, JR dove after a loose ball one time.|[OKC] Kendrick Perkins|68
Wasn't that last game? |NBA|1
True but it was 4 years ago...and he was tripped.|Suns|4
Kyrie fumbled about 25 passes I think|Lakers|341
Mark Sanchez of the NBA|Celtics|1
The west coast weed is stronger than what he and K Love can get on the east coast. Both should be good to go game 3||1
and JR was a hot mess|Timberwolves|3
60 or 70 turnovers IIRC||11
Remember when people used to give Bosh a hard time about nervousness and all that? Kyrie makes him look like a stone cold crunch time big game murderer.|Raptors|255
Wow this looks hilarious now |Cavaliers|1
Yep he sure made that shot.|Raptors|1
Bosh hit hella clutch 3s. Kylie ain't done shit besides that one regular season game against the Spurs.||7
Bosh was instrumental in one of the biggest plays in NBA history. I don't think anyone can knock his clutch gene.|Warriors|8
Yeah but Bosh has been clutch in the biggest moments. Bosh can actually play defense too.|Heat|67
Pretty ironic since Bosh's last notable moment in Toronto was... [well, blowing this bunny which ultimately cost us a playoff spot](https://youtu.be/RGOjqoATe5c?t=6m17s).\n\nDude became absolute money in the clutch once he went to Miami, though, and was never really the choke artist people made him out to be in the first place.|[TOR] Donyell Marshall|1
Exactly, dude had arguably the biggest rebound in playoffs history. Had 12 or 13 points in a quarter vs okc in a close out game. Hit multiple game winners in the regular season. I'm sure you know most of this but I just respect bosh so much for helping our team.|Heat|1
Never let people forget that play. |Heat|5
what play? Link pls :D||1
He most likely means this one: lebron was injured and bosh had like 37 and 10, with a game winner, quite clutch\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I45gW4cjWIM\n\n|Spurs|5
That was incredible! Thanks. I remember when i was younger trying to learn how to put down those left handed lay-ups because I saw Bosh do it so often.||1
> Bosh can actually play defense too. \n\nThis x 100. People tend to forget why the Heat were so good. LeBron and Wade were elite defenders, and if any of the other 3 players on the floor even gave half of a shit, the defense would be great. This cavs team plays shit perimeter defense. |Cavaliers|42
Also I thought in game 2 they were so focused on the perimeter that they gave up free layups.||1
Wade? Did you mean bosh?||1
LeBron is now 9-1 following a Game 1 loss. RIP another irrelevant stat.|Warriors|252
He lost to the Spurs in 07 too. |Knicks|1
still hasn't lost scoring 30 points 6 rebounds 6 assists and 60+ FG% thoooooooo|Timberwolves|1
Who keeps track of this shit? Can\'t wait to see something like "Well, did you wonder if weather was a factor? On days where it\'s 100 degrees in Portland, LeBron James is 0-1 at Oracle Arena"|West|1
Don't know why anyone would buy into that when the more relevant one is lebron a record when mark Jackson is a commentator. |Trail Blazers|2
My favorite is that the team that wins game 1 has an 80% chance of winning the series. Typically the game 1 winner has home court advantage as well as is probably a better team. |Pacers|5
9-2. Got swept by the Spurs in '07. He was 9 straight after that. |Celtics|21
There GS goes again, breaking records.|Warriors Bandwagon|66
When I heard about that LeBron game 2 record I was like "we broke so many records already, won\'t mind breaking another one"|Warriors|2
"The Warriors are the first team since the 96 Bulls to break another team\'s Game 2 undefeated streak." - ESPN intern hoping no one tries to fact check him|Warriors|9
Cleveland gain the lead\n\nLose the lead\n\nStart losing by 10\n\nNow 20\n\nCleveland sports in a nutshell\n||190
I read this in the Halo narrator's voice|Kings|1
Cleveland favored to win the finals before the season, smash the east, get rekt in four. ||8
>Now 30\n\nI want to say that's GSW's MO too, but 33 is a bit extreme, even for them.||14
So to beat the Warriors, you need a big man who can score inside and defend, and wings who can disrupt GS passing. You basically need a team of MONSTARS with insane length and athleticism.\n\nOKC was close enough and made them look human|West|195
I'm obviously insanely biased, but Brad Stevens' Celtics with a talented big and maybe better 3pt shooting would do it. \n\nI mean we stopped their home streak, and almost beat them in Boston. When healthy we defend guards like no other team.|Celtics|1
I'm biased as hell and think Duncan Robinson when playing together could of done it.  Or Shaq/Kobe Lakers. |Spurs|2
So the Celtics with an entirely different roster.|Lakers|22
Or just one big and improved shooting from the current roster. |Celtics|0
Cavs for MONSTARS confirmed |Cavaliers|1
Tristan and Love did just enough inside, and LeBron is pretty much a Monstar|West|1
That's what Mozgod was before his knee surgery |Hornets|1
They can be beat, as OKC came oh so close, but not by LeBron and company. The Cavs have failed to notch a win against them in 4 tries this season. They're not winning 4 of 5 in this pressure cooker. |Knicks|3
"a big man who can score inside and defend"\n\nHmm easier said than done. How many players in the league are there that can do that? Towns? Boogie when his head is on straight?|Warriors|4
Whiteside!|Heat|6
Deng and Winslow maybe the lengthy wings? |Heat|2
Dwight and Aldridge can get buckets and play some defense. |Lakers|7
Can't be sporting a lakers flair and saying that|Lakers|5
While their was schadenfreude for most of the season, by the end, I sort of felt bad for him (as much as I could for a multimillionaire athlete who has slept with more women this year than most will in a lifetime). |Lakers|1
haven't been following basketball for a while. How is Dwight? I heard he kinda fell off after he left M agic||5
Yes, but only because he didn't fit the Rockets system |Hornets|2
If KD stays I think they have a real shot to knock them off next year barring injury.|Thunder|30
You could say you had a real shot this year too|Warriors|55
They had 3 shots|Warriors|43

Wonder if Lue will be on the hot seat if they do worse than last year's series\n\nProbably not because you can't do that to 2 coaches in a row, but just something to think about if they made the right move |Kings|85
As a Kings fan, yes, they absolutely *can* do that to 2, even 3 coaches in a row. \n\nWhen you've got the right GM, the sky's the fucking limit.|Kings|1

Well thats a bit of an exaggeration.\n\nAn example of a ridiculously dirty player would be dahntay jones who intentionally tries to injure players.|Warriors|7
I guess kicking people, tackling people, or arm pulling doesn't count as trying to injure people.||-4
Oh my god he kicks someone once or twice (with no proof of intent) doesn't make you someone who is trying to actively hurt others.\n\nShow me proof of him tackling someone\n\nAnd everyone in basketball does that arm pulling shit.  This subs golden boy Steven Adams did it just as frequently as Green did last series!|Warriors|2
I guess you're allowed to throw people to the ground MMA style in the NBA according to your blind homerism. http://ftw.usatoday.com/2016/04/draymond-green-tackle-warriors-rockets\nEdit.

They should give it to Luke Walton.|[OKC] Kendrick Perkins|50
Yes! Walton off the bench in game 4! |Warriors|2

lebron pulled a regular season curry, didnt bother playing in the 4th.|Bucks|213
Lebrons been pulling that since he entered the league /s|Spurs|1
> lebron pulled a regular season curry, **the warriors were so far ahead he** didnt bother playing in the 4th.\n\nFTFY|Warriors|5
whoooooooooooooooosh|Raptors Bandwagon|5

No it was just that adding that line literally ruined the joke |76ers|4

is there anything funnier than a wooosh that is a woooosh... its wooshception|Warriors|7
Still 3 quarters more than JR Smith has been playing. |Warriors|2
It's the only way he doesn't have to play the 4th, when they're losing handily. |Warriors Bandwagon|7
no clutch gene smh|[GSW] Wilt Chamberlain|8
Curry pulled a curry and didn't even play 30 minutes|Warriors|56
In hindsight, building a Big 3 with two defensive liabilities like Love and Kyrie might not have been the best idea. They need to be averaging 20 a night each to justify their spots on the floor, and they haven't come close these finals.\n\nLebron the player is amazing. Lebron the GM has been a disaster.|Supersonics|81
LeBron couldn't assemble a team that was better than the team that broke the all time wins record, so he's an awful GM. I hate this sub during the playoffs.|Clippers|-24
Lebron didn't choose Kyrie though? And the Cavs GM traded for Love right when Lebron signed. I doubt that was Lebron's Decision|Celtics|-18
It was 100% Lebron's decision to trade for Love. His agent also held the Cavs hostage to give Thompson a massive contract. And by all indications Blatt was gone because Lebron wanted him gone.\n\nLebron's my favorite player in the league so I'm not saying this from a place of hate, but this is the team he wanted constructed.|Supersonics|37
http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/id/11397368/kevin-love-traded-minnesota-timberwolves-cleveland-cavaliers\n\n"The Cavs and Timberwolves have been discussing a trade involving Love for months, long before James decided to leave Miami and come back home to Ohio. The deal dragged on through the summer, first because of Cleveland\'s unwillingness to include Wiggins in any package, and then due to the 30-day provision."\n|Celtics|-9
shhhh dont ruin the narrative|Cavaliers|-9
Come on bruh. |Heat|2
The reason the cavs were unwilling to commit to giving up Wiggins was because they were not sure what Lebron was going to do. Once he signed he took over. What's hard to understand. ||9
does that sound realistic at all? why would cavs okay that trade if there was no belief that klove would re-sign after the contract was over? only reason was because lebron brokered the trade|Lakers|7
i don't know the story. i'm just quoting what the article said|Celtics|-5
Eh, LeGM seems to have worked out.|NBA|1
>Lebron the player is amazing. Lebron the GM has been a disaster.\n\nStill following in Jordan's footsteps I see.|Heat|19

This series is everything Dan Gilbert deserves.|Warriors|104
hahahaha|Supersonics|1
Right now his team looks like comic sans against the Warriors Times New Roman|Kings|1
Still agree with that?|Cavaliers|2
Nah, but I'm happy for Nick Gilbert. |Warriors|1
I like LeBron but I can't stand Dan Gilbert |Spurs|3
Joe Lacob may be a smug libertarian asshole, but Dan Gilbert is literally Dan 'Literally Dan Gilbert' Gilbert, so it's clear which owner people should be rooting for.|Warriors|5
I normally would love to see a competitive series but I'd love to see a sweep just because it'd mean another year that shit head doesn't win a title. |Trail Blazers|7
It would be much sweeter if they don't make the finals with that salary heavy roster but this will do.|Heat|11
fuck Dan Gilbert so hard. |Heat|54

Look,  we don't want to be here.|Cavaliers|9
Hey man that's my line||2
call me bitter, but lebron too. If not for anything other than going back to that jerk off, who publically humilated him, and after he came down to us and got his only two rings. ||16
When Richard Jefferson is your second best player on the floor, you have a problem. |Thunder|134
Yeah, if only Jason Kidd could come out of retirement to throw down some of those sweet alley oops.  Maybe give the Cavs a shooter, is Kerry Kittles around?  Also, what about Kevin Love?  Should Kenyon Martin come in to save the day?|76ers|1
Props to him for the effort though ||75
I think /r/nba owes the refs an apology|[GSW] Shaun Livingston|370
Nah they sucked and so did the Cavs.|Cavaliers|-11
people are downvoting you cause they want to believe the refs didnt noticeably favor the warriors in that game.  they're wrong.  shit was disappointing even as a warriors fan.|Warriors|0
I just think they're bad all around.  It's not like they cost the Cavs the game, they did that very well on their own.|Cavaliers|14
Cavs shot 14 more free throws, Curry was in foul trouble, and the Cavs still lost by 33... What favored the Warriors?|Raptors Bandwagon|20
i'm no coach or anything but watching the game, as a warriors fan, i felt like the warriors got the vast majority of close calls|Warriors|2
I mean they called 2 travels on Lebron, but other than that it was still pretty heavily in the Cavs favor until the game was out of reach.|Raptors Bandwagon|1
There always has to be a villain for r/nba to thrash and circlejerk to death. It was Draymond last week and its the Cavs now. And if you think you can go against the grain with something objective, youre mistaken.||6
Oh it was Draymond for more than a week lol.  Are people viewing the Cavs as villains?  I'm getting the vibe that people just view them as garbage and even saw some comments from GS fans saying they feel bad for the Cavs haha.  |Cavaliers|10
Its not vitriolic like Draymond, but villains in the sense that its a one sided series so far, so they feel robbed of entertainment (blame the Cavs) and lot of them wanted to see the Warriors lose. The refs thing just doesn't align with the subsequent Cavs bashing. \n\n\n||5
I gotcha.  It's weird because it's not like I said the refs are the reason we lost or anything.  They made dumb calls that were in our favor as well as dumb calls that weren't.|Cavaliers|5
Which shouldnt be controversial if you saw the game, have two eyes and a brain. But it is what it is. Never lose objectivity for the threat of losing fake internet points.||6
I wouldn't say they were great tonight, but given the expectation that they would be atrocious (and they have earned that reputation) I'd say they were OK. There were missed calls, sure (case in point the elbow to Love's head) but they didn't alter the game, which in the NBA is about as much as you can ask from the refs imo. |Warriors|1
I disagree.  Just because they didn't alter the game doesn't mean they weren't shit.  That goes for both ends.  I can't remember who it was but someone on GS had a horribly weak foul on LeBron while he was shooting that felt like a dumb call when you consider how physical the refs are letting this series get.  That's just one example. |Cavaliers|2
I'm not gonna defend those guys, they are awful. It's just that the bar is really low because they've been so, so awful. |Warriors|1
Oh definitely, I assume most people don't really care about being downvoted.|Cavaliers|6
The refs owe Kevin Love an apology.  At least call the obvious ones that result in concussions|Trail Blazers|-1
If you watch the replay in real time, that foul was very easy to miss.  Everyone I was watching with didn't realize Love got fouled until we saw him on the floor.  It makes sense because the refs were keeping track of so many things on that rebound.|Spurs|7
Ha, wasn't that one of the better called games of the playoffs too?|[LAL] Kobe Bryant|0
Honestly seemed more biased towards GS, if that is even possible with that crew. There were some super questionable calls it seemed.||1
First half free throw attempts was 12-2 in favor of the Cavs.  \n\nSecond half the refs just stopped trying because there was no saving them.  People would start to get suspicious if you tried to give the Cavs an extra 40 free throws to make the game close.  |Rockets|4
Cavs FTA advantage 24-10.|Lakers|10
on behalf of /r/nba I apologize to Scott Foster, Tony Brothers. They did a good job of swallowing their whistles, called some surprising travels and even some moving screens! |[GSW] Klay Thompson|278
Scott foster was the one who t'd up green against the thunder. He has done a great job but after that tech they didn't let him ref another game that series |[LAL] Kobe Bryant|-1
Did he not toss Livingston against the Blazers as well?|[GSW] Klay Thompson|5
Yeah I looked like an idiot tonight and owe drinks for a lot of people next weekend for believing in Tony Brothers incompetence.|Lakers|1
We know which way they bet the game|Warriors|1
The moving screens on Mozgov were so weak. Other than that and a few other missed call it was a pretty good game by the refs.|Warriors|11
Yeah what the fuck I thought Lebron's crab dribbles were written into the rules at this point with how many times they let it go|[NBA] Dion Waiters|75
both times it looked like improperly executed jump stops, he skipped to his lou instead of landing on both feet. |[GSW] Klay Thompson|21
I think he should have just skipped Lou all together...|Raptors Bandwagon|22
Just name LeBron the coach already.|Raptors|2
Forreal though I don\'t know why they need to beat around the bush will these "coaches"|Raptors Bandwagon|2
They totally faked us out. |Warriors|128
They probably bet the opposite their tendencies and made a killing.|Warriors Bandwagon|5
They called back to back travels on *Lebron*. I've never seen that kinda shit in my life.|[NYK] Kristaps Porzingis|249
And completely ignored Love getting domed by an elbow.|Celtics|7
They called only 1 on him the entire series against the Raps, and he was travelling anywhere from 4-6 times every game. Not like it would've made a huge difference in our series anyways, but so satisfying to see him finally get called for that junk. |Raptors|25
He's always travelled|Pistons|2
That was a goddamn *statement* and it was kind of glorious.|[CHI] Michael Jordan|39
And they called one on Klay too (travel on a one-two jump stop), so it seems like they weren't simply targeting LeBron with that call.|Warriors|2
statement game for the refs. putting the league on notice|Timberwolves|4
yeah at that point I couldnt even conjure words of shock.||20
Observations:\n\nTurning point - 3rd quarter when Steph goes out with his 4th foul and the Warriors (instead of maintaining a single digit lead) grow it to 20 entering the fourth\n\nMost surprising part of the game - refs weren't that bad\n\nFinal thought - how about Bogut setting the pace defensively early with those 4 blocks in the first quarter?|Celtics|162
He got those 4 block within 3 minutes and 49 seconds it's crazy.|[LAL] Kobe Bryant|1
How can you justify a no-call on an obvious elbow that results in a concussion||2
They missed a pretty big foul on KLove...elbows to the back of the head should probably be called.  Other than that not too bad|Trail Blazers|4
and to think Bogut didn't even play in the Finals last year lol|Warriors|2
Scott Foster been reading Reddit thinking "Fuck you r/nba I\'ll show you all" |Warriors|5
Nah, I think he just bet the opposite of everyone else.|Pistons|2
Bogut is low key the Dub's X factor. During the OKC series it was Bogut's defense and playmaking that changed the game. |Thunder|11
Bogut won us Game 5 last series for real. When he turns it on and expends that energy, it is fucking on.|[GSW] Zarko Cabarkapa|3
He altered so many Russell and KD layups. I wouldnt be surprised if Bogut was the reason KD wasnt driving for layups in game 6|[LAL] Nick Young|8
bogut is all about the unrecorded stat of altered shots|Warriors|18
Nothing like ending the NBA season with a few exhibition games|Trail Blazers|40
I don't know, the Cavs pulled out that last one close. \xf0\x9f\x98\x8f|Cavaliers|2
Only won by 33\n\nNot impressed||34
Warriors top players are still not being 100%. Curry is at 50% Klay is more at 70%. by game 4 and both are healthy, it might be a massacure|Warriors|1
Blatt: 30-11 without Kyrie for large stretch, went 4-2 in Finals previous season without Love and Kyrie\n\nLue: 27-14 with a healthy squad, lose first 2 games of Finals in blowouts|Timberwolves|34

Well he did, so....|Cavaliers|1
It just amazes me how the Warriors are having their way with the Cavs without Curry having any dominant performances. As a basketball fan, I just hope to see a competitive series.||116
Methinks you will be disappoint |Lakers|1
He was pretty dominant tonight, just didn't play much because of foul trouble.|Supersonics|1
As a Lebron fan just end it already |Hornets|2
Happy now? :)|NBA|1
The warrios first 5 bench could all be carted off to the east and be a dominant team there all on their own. Couple that with a starting lineup as talented and amazing as what they have right now and it's just stupid hard to find a chink in their armor that will put them out for good. Okc got close but each time someone of the warrio4s stepped up when it mattered (and okc ch(okc)ed).||2
Re-watch the OKC series|Warriors|11
That was the thing that's stuck out. Neither of the Warrior's best scorers have had a game of 20+ points yet and they're still dominating this series. Cleveland players have gotten a bit shell shocked. It was the same for a ot of the Warriors the first 2-3 games last year though so let's not count the cavs out just yet. I don't expect Lebron to just sit and watch another championship slip down the drain|Clippers|16
thats what happens when every player on the warriors is better than their opposition other than lebron||62
I don't know how many games it would take the Cavs to beat the Warriors 4 times but it sure as shit isn't 5 games. |Warriors|31
7 but I catch you gist.  |Warriors|2
I'm not sure you do. He is saying that the Warriors can likely beat the Cavs 4 times out of 5 games. It may take the Cavs 12-16 games to win 4 of them. ||7
There's only 5 games left in this series. |Warriors|13
It is 5.|Cavaliers|1
Ahh.  I see.  NM.  :)|Warriors|6
It's all good dude. We're up 2-0!|Warriors|5
7\n\nThe answer is 7.|Cavaliers|2
FWIW, The Warriors are currently 9-3 in the Kerr era against the Cavs (regular season + playoffs).|Warriors|2
Let's go ahead and say it.\n\nBest NBA teams:\n\n1. Warriors\n\n2. Thunder\n\n3. Spurs \n\n4. Cavs|Hawks|266

Honestly the Warriors struggled more against Portland than they are against the cavs right now.|Warriors|50
to put it in Kerr's words, they were playing portland as though it was november|Lakers|4
Probably because we didn't have Curry. The game we lost was also not in Oracle.|[GSW] Draymond Green|9
Obvious bias, but even with the games with Curry back, none of them were blowouts like these. |Trail Blazers|4
Healthy Clips at 5 and honestly a decent argument for 4|Warriors|28
Don't see why they couldn't have made a case for 3 or 2 given the chance, though odds get pretty slim at that point.|Clippers|0
This is the most boring finals I have seen in my lifetime (so far, it's only 2 games though, things can change) and I've seen the Spurs in the Finals many times.|NBA|408
Lol wasnt boring for me!  Been at both games and seeing the warriors blow teams out again brings a smile to my face everytime.  Nothing quite like shouting GIVE THE BALL TO B-RUSHHH!!!!! in an nba finals game|[GSW] Draymond Green|1
Man some of those Spurs/Pistons games were boring. Except for the last 2 minutes.|76ers|1
The Spurs are fun to watch though|Warriors|1
I am having a great time||2
I'm happy for you.|NBA|3
Either 2002 or 2003 is going to end up worse than this one.  The Lakers led like every minute of the 2002 series, and that Nets team was just uninspiring.  \n  \nNeither the Spurs nor the Nets cracked 100 in a game in the 2003 Finals, and the Nets won a game 77-76.  \n  \nSo, basically, Richard Jefferson has been involved in some shitty Finals.||3
Well I'm enjoying it. The Warriors are playing some insane basketball, their defensive communication is on another level right now.|[LAL] Julius Randle|3
Not even lying, I fell asleep during both games and I was not even tired once. |Lakers|3
2005 Finals was the same start. Spurs wiped the floor with Detroit, who returned the favor twice. Went to seven games. Everyone here blowing their load early. |NBA|5
The Pistons were great||1
I mean... hopefully it goes something more like that series but we're talking 73-9 vs. rookie head coach and Richard Jefferson here.|NBA|10
2007 was worse|Warriors|5
That 07 Cavs was literally youngish Lebron and a whole bunch of scrubs against prime age Tim, prime age Manu, prime age TP, Bruce Bowen, etc.|[SAS] Tim Duncan|1
This is beautiful in a basketball point of view because of how GSW is playing, but entertaining? Hell nah.|Spurs|20
Game needs to be close to close to be entertaining. |Warriors|8
I don't know, I'm kinda loving it so far|Warriors|1
Spurs have been involved in some incredible finals basketball, the Cavs one being the most boring.|Spurs|15
The Spurs before this current era weren't the most fun team to watch (honestly the NBA in the mid-00s was pretty dire overall), some of their finals were pretty boring (outside of maybe the 05 one but even then the actual basketball wasn't the greatest).|Raptors|3
2013 and 2014 were pretty great|Bulls|2
I did specify before this current era, the mid-00s Spurs were not the same as the early to mid-10s Spurs. |Raptors|3
Point taken.|Bulls|1
That OKC series though...||266
The west > east\nAnd it's not even close this year ||1
It was nice. That doesn't make up for this series. Yuck. I really hope the Cavs make SOMETHING out of it but, there is just no hope in sight right now.  |NBA|30
That's clearly on the Cavs tho|Warriors|1
> I really hope the Cavs make SOMETHING out of it\n\nI could see game 3 being really down to the wire in which case a Warriors win would totally break Cleveland and then they just walk through game 4 for the sweep.|Warriors|8
This is the most likely result.|NBA|5
Watching this series must be awful for the Thunder|Trail Blazers|227
If this keeps up, I think it's more likely to send KD East.  Easier path to the finals there|Hawks|0
It's horrible |Thunder|1
It was going to be terrible to watch for whoever lost the OKC-GSW series. Each team would be looking at the games thinking "if we won that one game, were a lock for the championship."|Pistons|1
Tell us about it. |Thunder|1
I enjoyed the ending.|Supersonics|1
We are watching the winner of the 3rd place series play 1st place & it sucks.||3
Mixed reaction. I still hate the dubs more than any other team in sports, but embarrassing Cleveland like this makes us look so much better. |Thunder|3
Right?? It almost feels like a freebie championship. ||4
A freebie has never felt so fleeting.|NBA|1
Haha I totally forgot saying this. Crazy series. ||1
Just about every western conference team I bet. spurs wishing they could've been in the east too.|[LAL] Vlade Divac|7
Like a 49er fan watching the Seahawks bend Denver over.|Warriors|16
Those playoffs hurt my soul as a 9er fan. First we lose Bowman to a gruesome injury on National TV which they replayed more than enough times then they lose in a last chance interception. To make it even worse it was done by the most hateable player on their team. Two weeks pass by and you just see Denver bendover for the whole world to see.\n\n\n\nEdit: i also get sad when i realize that that was the last game both Bo and Pat played together.|[LAL] Nick Young|10
During that three year monster stretch, we lost heartbreaking playoff games to the eventual SB winners every season (Giants, Ravens in the SB, Seahawks).|Warriors|1
Refs didn't help us that game....|Kings|2

[Goddamn it](http://larrybrownsports.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/steve-kerr-clipboard.jpg)|Thunder|18
The Thunder and Warriors were playing at such a high level and playing so focused and hard it's no wonder why the Warriors are beating ass. Cleveland never had to dig in and earn it. I am confident had the Thunder advanced it would still be the same story.|Thunder|98
nah i don't think so \n\nyou guys play the same way(iso heavy, pick roll with no ball movement) . they could've negated your big advantage with thompson and love\n\npretty sure cavs would beat you guys.||-1
Absolutely. I'm honestly surprised by these games. I really wanted this to be a good series. Hopefully they turn it around at home. But right now it looks like the WCF was the real finals|Warriors|17
This finals has been really dissapointing from an entertainment stand point.|Thunder|10
Honestly. I hated you guys. But I respect you guys.  All I said that entire time during and leading up to that series was how scary you guys are. I'm so glad we survived you lol. But you guys would have done the same if not worse to the cavs|Warriors|8
I can say from these two Finals games, the only thing my friends and I have been talking about is how the Thunder series steeled the Warriors for the Cavs.  Compared to OKC, Cleveland looks like they're a bunch of 5 foot tall boys playing in slow motion.  It's amazing.  The fact that I saw passes into the paint for wide open dunks/layups was utterly shocking to me.  It's something we haven't seen the Warriors do in two weeks because we haven't been able to do it in two weeks.  The Thunder would absolutely murk this Cavaliers team. |Warriors|13
can you IMAGINE what Russ would do to Irving?? |Bulls|56
He wouldnt do anything, vs the Bulls he guarded Rose for 5 minutes, Rose had 12 points in the first, then they hid him and he guarded Snell or some shit the rest of the game, and some serious defender guarded Rose.\n\nI assume it would be the same vs Russ.|Knicks|5
And he's not even James Harden...|Clippers|1
Honestly, Irving would never guard Russ. They'd hide him on Roberson and let JR guard Russ. Love would be all right on Ibaka or Adams, too. \n\nThe problem with the Warriors is that all of their players are offensive weapons and they move the ball really well, so the Cavs can't hide their bad defenders. The Thunder would still have been the favorites, but they would have been a much better matchup for the Cavs. ||22
Adams would hoop on love r u kidding me.||1
Adams is good and would definitely cause problems for Love, but it's not like the Thunder are ever going to come down and give it to Adams every possession. Love on Adams wouldn't decide the series the way Kyrie on Curry is. ||2

He underestimated the Warriors for sure, but he was closer to the truth than a lot of people in this thread.|NBA|1
Warriors choked more than the Cavs won tbh.|Bulls|1
I disagree. Lebron's superhuman games 5-7, the twin 40+ point games from him and Kyrie in game 5, and the Big 3's clutch play at the end of game 7 (Kyrie 3, LeBron block and game-clinching FT and Love's D on Curry at the end) are all examples of the Cavs stepping up big time to win the series.|NBA|2

Why was it flaccid today??  |Trail Blazers|2
Absolutely pathetic showing by everyone on the Cavs not named LeBron or Jefferson. This series was already going to be an uphill battle for them against an improved Warriors team but LeBron is absolutely helpless with Irving playing horrible and literally no one else is giving any effort.\n\nLiterally one of the worst team performances I have ever seen in a finals, LeBron was the only player on the Cavs even trying to win the game. Absolutely disgusting, James and Cavs fans have to be super disappointed in this team and the effort they gave tonight.\n\nJames needs to leave after this year, sorry Cavs fans but he can't  do it by himself.\n\nedit: since a lot of people seem to be getting confused, I am not saying that they don't have talent, I am saying that all the talent in the world doesn't matter if they go out there and don't even try. Talent still requires effort to be effective.\n\nJR Smith has played 69min in 2 games so far, he has attempted 9 shots and made 3. Sixty. Nine. Minutes. And has only shot the ball NINE times.\n\nWhen L James scores 19pts w/ 8 turnovers and was still the best player on the Cavs by a large margin...thats really not good.|Wizards|351
I think Richard Jefferson and J.R were definitely putting in effort too but other than that everyone on the cavs was frustrating as fuck to watch. |Nuggets|3
And it still felt like JR didn't show up somehow. I ninja edited Jefferson in there haha you were too quick for me|Wizards|5
JR is only getting touches with a defender already set on him which causes him to create his own shot. He's best at the catch and shoot which seems to have disappeared from the playbook. |Cavaliers|8
Why does LeBron always get a pass?  \n\nHe's playing like ass. |NBA|27
He got pretty close to a triple double and didn't really play the fourth||-3
God I swear you people who live by stats...\n\nDID YOU WATCH THE GAME?\n\nDid you see the part where he was practically useless? Zero finesse. Zero offensive versatility. Zero footwork. Zero post game. Dumb decisions. Bad passes. Bad shots. \n\nIsn't his whole M.O. that he makes his teammates better?\n\nHowever you look at it he played terrible. \n|NBA|41
Three separate times LeBron pulled a double team on a drive and his kick out pass went right through the hands of an open three point shooter out of bounds. Not to mention the plenty of other times he hit those same guys dead in the hands and they just flat out missed the shots the offense is designed to create.|Celtics|1
hehehe|Supersonics|1
Must have watched a different game, when no one on the cavs moves without the ball not much lebron can do if everyone on his team stands around and watches him.|Cavaliers|15
You mean when they watch him back down Steph Curry or Klay Thompson because that should be an easy 2 points, but he decides to throw a pass cross court instead? \n\nJust about anyone is going to be caught off guard by a decision like that. You have to take advantage of that and not look to pass (or get an assist for that stat sheet). \n\nSeriously, he's supposed to be one of the best, but he doesn't really play like he wants to win a championship. He plays like he wants to be in the stat record books.|Spurs|3
When others get the ball he just stands around, as well. He needs to be held accountable too. |NBA|9
He's supposed to be a top 5 player of all time. He's supposed to be transcendent.\n\n19 points on 7/17 shooting with 7 TO's isn't good enough. I don't care if he almost got a triple double.|Raptors|21
You realize that 3 of those were passes that went straight through his teammates hands?\n\nWhen no one on your team hits any shots, plays any defense, or spaces the floor properly, it's really hard to be amazing all by yourself against a terrific defensive team.|Hornets|11
He\'s supposed to be running an offense and telling them where to go. By his own admission, he\'s the "offensive coordinator".  But instead he tries to iso freight train into some of the best wing defenders in the league. LeBron is getting outsmarted by the Warriors defense, and instead of trying new things, he sticks with what doesn\'t work.|Warriors|6
Because everyone just reads stats and says 'oh he's putting up x numbers so he can't be the problem'. But pts/rbs/ast only tell so much. |Trail Blazers|10
I dont even think James performed well enough. I cant give him a pass when it is his only game ever in the finals to not score a point in the first quarter. He needs to attack more efficiently to get his team going. His team is best when he is scoring. However Jefferson was a beast and needs a starting position, i dont care who he replaces\n |Celtics|5
Yeah James is playing very poorly by his standards, thing is I don't think it matters. He could have scored 40 tonight and it wouldn't have made a lick of difference with the way his supporting cast performed.\n\nIt's NOT good when LeBron has a game like tonight and is still carrying his team, that is NOT a good sign for the Cavs|Wizards|2
For the next game the Cavs need to let Kyrie do the ball handling and let Lebron bruise down low and score from the post. He had a drop step post move on Green that froze him that should of been an and one with the double team. He cant do that all night but he should be doing it more than he was tonight. And Kyrie/JR need to pick up their game\n|Celtics|2
Problem with that is Kyrie has more TO's than assists so far in this series, he has done a poor job moving the ball around when he has had it so I am not sure if that is a good idea|Wizards|2
yeah he needs to stop trying to score the ball and try and assist and let his offense come to him. The reason why he is turning the ball over is because he is forcing himself\n|Celtics|1
The classic "Lebron needs more help!!!" comment that has been going on every time Lebron loses a series, except in 2011 when he was the one who played bad. \n\n\nEither way it\'s hard for him to find a more talented roster to go to than this Cavs team, even if they underperforming in the finals. Where\'s he going to go that\'s better than the Cavs talent-wise? |Toronto Huskies|46
Nowhere, it turns out.|NBA|1
Big 3's is so 2011! What LeBron needs now is 4 all stars on his team|Knicks|1
No one said they were talented. You can have all the talent in the world and it doesn't man any difference if you don't show up and put effort in|Wizards|4
Honest question: how much of that falls on LeBron for his leadership? A lot? Not at all?|Warriors|3
I don't put other players performance or lack thereof on another player.\n\nLeBron could be the greatest leader in the world, but if the other guys aren't showing up, hitting shots, putting in effort etc you can't exactly put the blame on another guy. Just my 2 cents though|Wizards|0
Well his pregame speeches sound like PR statements and he was the one who basically built this time|[SAS] Tim Duncan|1
What's fair is fair. \n\nIf Lebron gets credit for making his teammates better, he should get the credit for making them worse?||2
the Warriors?|Hawks|6
Seriously -- sorry Barnesey!|[CHI] Michael Jordan|2
>Where's he going to go that's better than the Cavs talent-wise?\n\nI'd give LeBron better odds to win a finals with about 5 teams in the west and possibly Toronto in the East. \n\nPut LeBron at the wing in Toronto and that would be a NASTY line up.\n|Hornets|20
How did they blow is out that badly lol. The cavs are solid I just think love & Irving are not the best defenders and gsw are possibly The Best Team Ever.||1

Oops, fixed|Wizards|1
I really think the Cavs bought into their own hype way too hard. The Warriors did that in the WCF and it nearly bit them hard. Now they ain't fucking around. But Cleveland had too easy of a time. They walked into the rematch feeling themselves because they only lost twice and last year was a fluke because health and this year they're way better. Then they got punched in the mouth, and I don't see any sort of poise. I hope, for the sake of my own entertainment, that the Cavs get their shit together and play like a team that's playing in the damn Finals.|Warriors|7
woah. what about richard jefferson?|Nets|47
Is that the guy on the nickel?||2
I don't watch much basketball and I was like holy shit, I remember him from when I was like 12 years old, is that Richard Jefferson? ||24
Richard Jefferson doesn't deserve to be lumped in with the rest of the Cavs. He's been playing better than Lue could have hoped. As for everyone else though....||27
I ninja edited Jefferson in there, yall are quick|Wizards|28

Damn Bay Area looks nice as hell...probably expensive as shit|West|23
Very, am currently renting, 2BR 1Bath (house) with my wife while we look at houses to buy. It is 900SQFT, 3500$ per month, which I am told is quite expensive compared to other areas, but as someone who was born and raised in the bay area, its just normal to me.||1
Everyone makes a lot of money around here so yeah, that's the cost of living. I'm in SF right now, it's a little bit more pricey than the North Bay where I'm from, but with a $13/hr min wage as the baseline, it doesn't take much to make some money.|Warriors|6
yeah but at $13 an hour you are probably living in the ghetto|West|9
Yeah I guess, I'm in school so I have grants and loans for now my room is only 850/month so it's not too bad. If you move to SF just stay away from UCSF and Hunter's Point. Definitely stay away from Oakland unless you have money. 13/hr is the bare min so we are talking McDonalds, Starbucks, etc. You can make like 20-25/hour doing basic stuff like accounts payable / accounts receivable. |Warriors|2
>You can make like 20-25/hour doing basic stuff like accounts payable / accounts receivable. \n\nThat's pretty much what I'm making now and I live in Houston, but I'm at a top 5 Fortune 500 company (Oil and gas). |West|1
Yeah my buddy last year graduated with a finance degree from SFSU and he was offered 25 right out of the gates starting. I'm studying computer-science so I'm looking for 100g's once I graduate! That's the dream! When I was at my junior college in Santa Rosa I figured I might as well come here to SFSU 'cuz when I graduate in 2 years I'll have tons of job opportunities.|Warriors|2
As a recent SFSU grad (2014) and fellow WRX driver lemme just say this now. MAKE FRIENDS WITH EVERYONE. I joined a service fraternity which was basically just a dating service and it's landed like 70-80% of us jobs. Everybody knows somebody that can help you out so use your free time well. CS is a great field to major in, just remember getting the job is never about how good you are, it's all about if you get along with your fellow co-workers.|[GSW] Antawn Jamison|1
You're right, and I like the idea of working on a team with people and building things. Personally, I haven't joined any fraternities or anything but I have networked pretty well with people so far. In the library with some friends right now!|Warriors|1
SRJC!!! Amazing school, actually |Warriors|1
Yep, $13 gets you jack in the bay. Hell, i got paid $18/hr working at an apple store for a little before i got into grad school and that barely helped either.\n\nNow, I'm in nowheresville Virginia where a house cost here as much as a 1bd apartment 30 minutes outside of San Francisco...\n|[LAL] Rick Fox|10
There are good parts and bad parts, just like anywhere else. It's easy to get caught up in the romance of it all due to the massive amounts of money and world-famous companies kicking around.\n\nI lived there for the first half of my life and don't particularly have the inclination to move back -- even with the job opportunities, cost of living is so astronomical that getting a $70K job out of college or whatever doesn't mean as much as if it the job were in Sac or somewhere else.|Kings|3

It's not like this West is any but less tough than it was during the 90s and early 2000s. Malone, The Dream, and The Admiral had 6 appearances combined when the east was mostly just Jordan. |Heat|1

Had the exact same convo with a friend after the game. Why isn't the finals played between the two best teams in the league?|Warriors|11
Yeah, shoulda been OKC or Spurs vs Cavs.|Cavaliers|1
It's particularly confusing in the nba. Nfl has sudden death matches so it's a craphsoot anyway. Nba has 7 game series, only to end up with the finals between the best and the 4th best team. No semi finals should be more exciting than a finals. \n\nIt'd be like tennis having Europe in one bracket and America in another just to ensure viewership. |NBA|1
West is top heavy. East is getting better. If we really are saying scramble the teams so that one or two teams have a better shot at the finals, well that's just bullshit. It's not like the Cavs won 40 games.|Heat|1
The league won't do it, but really what is the argument for keeping conferences? Money? Travel time is real but the schedule doesn't *have* to be 82 games and the playoffs can be spread out more to allow travel time. \n\nThis years Finals has obviously been especially bad, but I just don't see a good argument for not wanting the absolute best 2 teams playing each other for the championship. It's not like the East will be excluded. I'm sure LeBrons teams (and other Eastern teams) would still have a great shot a getting to the Finals. And if the Wesg really is top heavy like you say, more East teams would get in, so it seems like the East would benefit (this year) anyways. \n\nI just don't see how, from a fans perspective, watching a potential WCF matchup in the first round or seeing a ridiculously lopsided Finals is better than making sure each round you face tougher and tougher opponents.|Warriors|1
Well travel time and money is probably the biggest point of contention. Conferences and then divisions help dramatically with scheduling, As you play certain opponents more often. Why would you want to decrease the total season?\n\nAs for the current discussion regarding that OKC had gotten screwed especially this year, even with reseeding, Okc still would have played Golden State in the semifinals as Thunder would have overall 5th seed. Either way Thunder had to go through Golden State.\n\nChicago would have been the 16th seed over Houston this year with reseeding.|Heat|1
I don't think OKC got screwed. I think the fans got screwed because this has been a very boring Finals so far. San Antonio got screwed because as the second best team in the league, they met third best team in the second round. Cleveland as the fourth best team beat the fifth best team in the third round to get to the Finals.\n\nIt's clearly not an entirely fair system. Some people are okay with it not being fair and I guess that's fine. I think the league should at least consider changing it, but I know they won't.|Warriors|1
Not by standings. At end of reg season, Cavs were 3rd best and Raptors were 4th best thunder were the 5th best team. \n\nBeyond that it's all hindsight saying who was best. |Heat|1
> Why isn't the finals played between the two best teams in the league?\n\nMoney reasons. There's no way Eastern conference owners would allow that to happen. With as weak as the eastern conference is; they'd be losing money out the ying-yang as no one would watch.\n|Thunder|2
That would be pretty neat. Top teams rescrambled because of record for playoffs. |Thunder|3

I mean this is what happens when you build a team so top heavy. Lebron loves his big 3's but 3 max contracts seriously hinders your ability to put together a deep and reliable roster. And if any of your big 3 have off games, as we saw tonight, you have no chance.|Bulls|1

He may not be on the best team in the world, but I mean he still is the best player right now.|Bulls|0
My point was more about being self-absorbed enough to say it. He said that he wasn't worried about the Warriors last year because he was the best. That's just some other level of hubris. |Warriors|-1
why?|Heat|86
Because people love to hate the best athletes, like Brady and Rodgers in football; lots of people like it when they fail. I think a lot of Cavs fans would be acting the same about Curry, though I don\xe2\x80\x99t think he\xe2\x80\x99s as hated as LeBron.|Cavaliers|-10
Except curry isn't an egomaniacal asshole with the gall to claiming to be the best player ever after losing.  Curry isn't someone who never takes responsibility or shifts blame for mistakes and losses... that's what people are saying.\n\nWhen someone like LeBron puts himself on such a singular pedestal with all the talk he talks, and makes excuses for when things don't work out, maybe it's time for him to dial down the self aggrandizement.   However, this concept seems to mystify many LeBron fans.||-2

That's |NBA|1
He should've stayed with the Heat... Bet he's regretting his decision real bad right about now |Warriors|1
In my mind it comes back around to LeBron\'s somewhat selfish demeanor he tries to get away from. He wants to be known as the selfless guy who wins a championship for his hometown but everything he does seems so fake and self centered.\n\nHe leaves Miami when they begin aging to go back to Cleveland. He learned from his previous mistake with the interview and ONLY did that written exclusive for SI. Man whatever happened to just playing? Who gives enough of a fuck to take that time.\n\nThen he gets to Cleveland to "save them". Immediately pulls some strings to trade Wiggins sacrificing the teams future for his own personal gain in the short term.\n\nNext the whole David Blatt fiasco where the dude is doing his job, and a pretty decent job at that, but not the way Lebron wants him to do it. So he pulls more strings and has him axed and now we end up with Lou as the coach.\n\nBasically many people, myself included, wish Lebron could just stick to playing basketball and let an organization run like it should. He isn\'t the first player to have influence on team decisions, but he seriously looks like he\'s calling the shots. Now we can all just sit back and laugh as Wiggins is looking like a rising star in Minnesota, Love is a former shell of himself, Kyrie who Lebron came to play with is giving 0 effort, and Lou is doing a terrible job while Blatt did more than okay last year.\n\nTLDR; Lebron can\'t just win, he has to win his way and when he acts like an entitled child until he gets what he wants and it blows up in his face it feels like sweet karma.|Bucks|1
> this is the team Lebron wanted, with the coach he wanted, with the players he wanted- who are all healthy.|Timberwolves|7
But why is that reason to hate him?|Heat|26
It is when you're a little bitch about what coach you want and shit on players you don't hand pick|Thunder Bandwagon|26
Woah there! Big guy over here! Lebron is a little bitchhhh.|Heat|-14
He ran a coach out of town for starters.|Hawks|35
Maybe. I haven't heard this confirmed. In any case, seems like a petty reason to hate him. |Heat|-17
I feel like going out of your way to get a successful person fired so you can have your friend take that guys place is a little more than petty.|Hawks|39
Especially since the new guy is not a good coach. \n\nI love LeBron, adore that dude, but the whole Blatt thing is complete bullshit |Spurs|19
Because he always beats my team|Hawks|63
Fair.|Heat|13
Because a player having influence over the team is the worst thing in the world, I guess.|Pistons|44
Yeah, I guess.|Heat|-2
It's because he's trying to do things that aren't his job. It's the same reason people hate ball hogs.\n\nLeBron's job is to play basketball. It's not his job to coach, and it's not his job to be the GM. Instead he's taken over the team because he knows the Cavs organization needs him, but he ends up just ruining his own chances by doing jobs he's not qualifies for. |Bulls|6
cause cleveland finally getting something would be terrible and instead we should hope the same team wins the finals every year|Celtics|1
No not at all, I think it's deserved especially when you're as good/valuable as LeBron.  But it definitely also means you'll get criticism if that team you had influence on creating gets fucking pounded in the Finals.|[CHI] Michael Jordan|66
Too bad he won.|Cavaliers|1
Uhh... yeah.  Obviously.  I don't think my comment was really the best to go back and laugh about lol.|[CHI] Michael Jordan|1

I love how this narrative has changed in a weeks time. Last week people though they sucked down 3-1, now since CLE is in a huge deficit, they're great (which they are). |Lakers|8
A lot of that is just that when things aren't going well the haters get louder and the supporters get quieter.  Then when things are going well the supporters get louder and the haters get quieter.  It's not so much that people are actually flip flopping that violently.|Celtics|6
I think this just goes to show you how good the Thunder were playing. Everyone knew the Spurs and Warriors were really good. The fact that the Thunder beat one and could compete with the other is a credit to them. The fact that the Cavs haven't shown they can means, well, they are either not as good as we thought or heavily under-achieving.|[DAL] Brian Cardinal|13

##THAT'S WHY!|Warriors|9
I like it because it gives more value to the heat organization |Heat|29
Pat Riley comes out an unsurprising winner in all of this, IMO|NBA|6
Well Love was out half of this game that's why they lost by 34 and not 44. So he has that going for him.|Warriors|11
Well, he didn't expect them to play like trash.|Raptors|303
Fuck you and your reasonable responses!|Heat|0
The team is good enough to win a championship, but not when they play like this|Cavaliers Bandwagon|-3
Except they aren't. I'd still take OKC and the Spurs in a series over them. The West is on a whole other level this year. \n\nThis is a team that won only 57 games in a weak conference. We're talking about 2 historically great regular season teams in the West and another that took one of them down and had the other on the ropes 3-1. All 3 teams would've crushed Cleveland IMO. |Raptors|19
Is it really a bad thing that they wouldn't beat a 73-9 team and a historically great defense with the Spurs? And I think they'd beat the Thunder. Not a big believer in Durant being able to win when it matters but that's just me|Cavaliers Bandwagon|1
Yeah its the same with everyone blaming Lue. The fact is GS is a way better team, and for the Cavs to win they need to play almost perfect and GS needs to play bad.|Cavaliers|6
What did he expect would happen with two shitty defenders that play at a faster pace would happen against the dubs. I said last year the only reason the Cavs won 2 games last year is because Delly and TT made the game slow and ugly and curry played like shit for a game and half. People really under rate how important defense is in the NBA. |[GSW] Tim Hardaway|1
He probably expected them to at least play like all stars offensively which they haven't been doing.|Raptors|1
You can't have your cake and have it not taste like shit too|Warriors|1
Anyone really surprised kyrie and love aren't playing well against this Warriors team?|76ers|1
I thought LeBron makes his teammates better?||1
Yeah, his shtick is to put his teammates in good positions to make plays and shots. What he can't do is make all of their shots go in. \n\nHe's been playmaking and setting his teammates up perfectly, they just can't shoot.|Raptors|2
No now it's shit on lebron isntead of green.|Celtics|4
Maybe he's not a good GM then|[NJN] Yinka Dare|3

Are you saying he doesn't?|[MIA] Harold Miner|2
It\'s hard when guys just aren\'t shooting well & LBJ isn\'t playing as well as he could. Like kyrie is just missing shots & so are some others. Also, lebron is turning it over. \n\nThe guy who said "only when it\'s convenient" is technically right if convenient is every time the cavs don\'t play like ass|[NBA] Lebron James|5
yeah, imagine how awful they'd be if they didn't play with lebron|[HOU] James Harden|3
Yeah, his shtick is to put his teammates in good positions to make plays and shots. What he can't do is make all of their shots go in. \n\nHe's been playmaking and setting his teammates up perfectly, they just can't shoot.|Raptors|5
But hes also playing with Kyrie Irving who has the opposite effect |[TOR] Amir Johnson|12
I really like Lebron's game and he usually does that. He seriously puts everyone in the best possible position to score but tonight he made sloppy passes ocassionally, Kyrie actually dropped a number of his passes and then the rest of them just couldn't convert. There's only so much one man can do and even then he makes mistakes. Lebron James is actually a human being, shocking as it may be to some |Clippers|25
he told me he was the (http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/6/69852/4404008-c15.jpg)[chosen] one\n\nedit: i can be retarded||-7
only when it's convenient|Timberwolves|70
So brave.|Celtics|2
He can't play 1 on 1 defense for them or box out their man for them. Also, how many dropped passes did his teammates have tonight? I remember at least three going right through their hands and out of bounds. |Trail Blazers|20
LeBron himself hasn't been amazing, but the guys around him are just straight up awful.|Celtics|24
there's nothing wrong with wanting those players, they just aren't performing, nobody can foresee that|Pistons|176
I would say more than a few people saw terrible defence from Love and Irving coming. I'm sure more people subscribed to the thinking that Matt Moore had about the style the Cavs played last year being impossible while playing Irving and Love, and that the style they play with those two just feeds the Warriors what they want.|Timberwolves|1
True, but there's no longer an excuse for his supporting cast surrounding him. The talent is there and these are the guys he wanted.|[BOS] Larry Bird|6
Maybe I'm misunderstanding, but are you saying that we can blame LeBron for this because his team is playing poorly?||2
Sounds like it. I mean can we not just criticize lebron's play anymore? He didn't play his best, let's talk about that. Instead, we're discussing his inability to force his teammates to play better. Wow|[NBA] Lebron James|-2
No people just can\'t say "oh but if Love and Kyrie were healthy" or "look at his teammates, they\'re trash" or "David Blatt has no control". This entire team has LeBron\'s fingerprints on it. So I don\'t want to hear anymore excuses. Just go out there and win a game.|[BOS] Larry Bird|10
"talent" doesn\'t matter if the guys around you are playing scared.. i can put jordan, kobe and shaq with lebron and if they played like absolute shit then talent doesn\'t really matter.|Pistons|11
Lol but guess who would take the blame if that team lost in the finals? |[NBA] Lebron James|1
everyone on the team who didn't play with any heart or didn't perform at all|Pistons|-1
GM James|[GSW] Stephen Curry|2
Part of what made those players all-time greats is that they never just didn't show up, never played scared, never played like absolute shit. Irving and Love clearly don't have that same fire. Not that anyone should shit on them for not being at the level of Jordan Kobe or Shaq, but part of the point is they aren't showing up in the Finals... where when you win you get to be the champions, you're so close there are no excuses for not giving it your all. \n\nI think they are just super demoralized because they can see they're so overmatched, up and down the rosters and the coaching staffs. Coaching is huge in the playoffs, and they don't even have a real coach. |Warriors|9
Problem is they literally aren't even trying. It's not like he picked garbage players to surround himself with, these guys just aren't showing up this series|Wizards|16
Outside of Irving and love they kinda are garbage|Celtics|1
I definitely wouldn't call the rest of the squad garbage, they are the Warriors but they are garbage|Wizards|3
A lot of people thought that this would not be as close of a series. They are not good defenders and the Warriors defense can just switch everything and still contest. A lot of people were saying these things, so I think it was foreseeable|Lakers|8
lebron knew two years ago that kyrie and Klove would perform like this in the finals? he knew what the warriors would win 70+ game two years ago and how they'd match up? I think he probably thought that K.Love and Kyrie were two young,hungry and talented guys who want to work hard and win a ring and 1 of them was already in Cleveland, so why not go home and try to win one for #TheLand, at that time it looked like the spurs were going to be in the finals for the next 5 years lol |Pistons|1
I was mainly talking about this year. But even still, there's a tendency for fans and players to rate a player based on old traditional stats, which love and Irving looked great on. But when you look at their defense and you look at how they do when they aren't primary ball handlers, it changes a bit. I was making the point last year that they might have actually had a better chance without love/Irving because it forced them to play a slower style and gave them a stronger defense (with maybe an offset in a less effective offense, but I'd argue net net was positive)|Lakers|9
I'm not sure why you're getting down-voted, it looks like a fair assessment so far. It's still early and a lot can change. But Cleveland just looks one dimensional because they don't have as many two-way players. Love and Irving are both negatives on defense. Same with Channing really. Shumpert is a net negative on offense. As is Thompson if he's not dominating the offensive boards. Just not enough two way players whereas everyone on Golden State's rotation can at the least hold their own on both ends. Wade and Bosh were outstanding on both sides of the ball and that's what separated them.||2
Yeah definitely. This seems obvious now, but not everyone was saying this last year when the dominant narrative was that Lebron managed to win two games without two of his best players, when in reality, he eeked out 2 games with the only lineup that had a chance.|Lakers|1
> nobody can foresee that\n\nHow about the people who disagreed with what Lebron wanted and were subsequently forced out of the Cavs organization? Pretty sure they foresaw it.|Warriors|6
That kyrie and Klove have no heart? |Pistons|-1
> That kyrie and Klove have no heart?\n\nIs this First Take or are we actually gonna talk about the weaknesses of this Cavs team?|Warriors|6
True but this is what happens when you build a team so top heavy. Lebron loves his big 3's but 3 max contracts seriously hinders your ability to put together a deep and reliable roster. And if any of your big 3 have off games, as we saw tonight, you have no chance.|Bulls|19
Cavs have a decent bench though. Y'all are really looking for reasons to shit on Lebron. He hasn't played horribly, he's down 2-0 to a 73-9 team after 2 away games. What were y'all expecting to happen?|[HOU] Tracy McGrady|1
To keep it competitive |Lakers|3
NO TEAM can ever expect to be as deep as the warriors are, they won the most games in a season for a reason. Dan gilbert was also perfectly fine with paying salary tax so max contracts aren't nearly as big of a deal. I agree that it hurts depth a bit but cmon lets be real, it's hard to get it as right as the warriors organization has gotten it in the past 6 years. And 2 rings is what they'll have to show for it, rightfully so. They just have better players and harder working players |Pistons|22

Lebron should've never left Miami. At least Wade and Bosh looked like they gave a shit on D. |East|20
He wanted more control in the organization and a younger team. He made the right decision but you can't deny that Wade and Bosh wanted it more and it showed on the court.||7
I'd disagree slightly in the sense that he left proven post season players and management for two young guys with a lot of offensive talent and a shaky coaching/management situation with no post season experience. It takes everyone some time to figure that out and Im not sure it matched well with LeBron's timeline.||3
I understand why he went back but it\'s impossible to win games against teams like the Warriors with your two other "stars" being straight up trash on defense. |East|5

Who actually said that? He's been roasting anyone and everyone 1 on 1 this season. |Warriors|2
Steph scored 18 in 25 minutes.  That's half a game with the double teams.  Ease off Steph and he'll drop 45 on the Cavs. |Warriors|5

so far, I'd say he's the favorite.|Warriors|16
Eh, I'm thinking Livingston. Well, hoping anyway||3
No doubt.  Livingston isn't going to get it and I don't think Andre will have enough on offense to repeat.  If Draymond puts up a triple double in game 3 or 4 I think he'll take it.  Klay/Steph still could if they pull one of their torch-fests though|Warriors|10
Lebron could win it, even if there is a sweep.  If no Warrior stands out and he dominates game 3 and 4.  That be pretty funny.  Jerry West won it as a loser.  ||-12
In a 7 game series I can see giving it to a loser. Maybe even in an extreme 6 game series (last year comes to mind). But not in a beatdown.|Lakers|1
Lol no way in hell.  If LeBron were going to win it, he would've won it last year when he absolutely destroyed.  He averaged 35.8 points, 13.3 rebounds, and 8.8 assists in the series, but they gave it to Iguodala anyway because he was on the winning team.  \n\nI think the voters just decided it's silly to have a member of the losing team waiting around with the champions to have a (somewhat) meaningless trophy presented to them after a crushing loss that sends them home.|Warriors|14

Well kind of.  Its just sort of a nondescript thing though.  It\'s as illustrative as just saying "play better".\n\n||0
Would love to watch Livingston knock down jumpers over Delly all next game. And Mozgov get switched onto Curry every time. It won't end well, again. Draymond said postgame they haven't figured out the Cavs but the truth is they have figured them out and exploited their weaknesses. Delly has short arms and Mozgov is slow to close at the perimeter.

Only way this series is rigged is if the Cavs players are getting paid off to play like shit, in which case they don't deserve it anyway.

Dumb reply, the disparity is irrelevant. \n\nWith 21 TO you wouldn't expect a team to win by 33; it's still a noteworthy observation, regardless of exactly how the opposition managed to suck so bad (in this case: by also turning it over a lot, amongst other things). \n\n|Pacers|3
[deleted]||-1
The point he's making is that they played so bad, and yet won by so much. It only matters **that** the opposition played worse, not **how** they did that, so the disparity is irrelevant. Whether they also got 17 turnovers themselves or did it by shooting 1/16 or their stars fouling out or whatever doesn't matter, only that a team was able to overcome 21 turnovers and somehow win a game by 33. |Pacers|0
[deleted]||-1
No, you can't read. \n\nIt matters that they *played worse*; not specifically that the TOs were comparable. The TOs were (one of) the factors that contributed to their playing worse, but that's irrelevant. If they (CLE) only had 2 TOs but scored 1/18 shooting, then GSW winning by 33 with 21 TOs would be equally noteworthy. \n|Pacers|1

There are people I this world who aren't affected emotionally by sports. How do I become one of those people?|Cavaliers|12

Time to eliminate the conferences. I dont get the point of splitting the competition in half. I have no doubt that there are season were both conferences had equivalent teams when compared to each other but why not just do away with them and guarantee a great playoffs with a 1-16 seeded bracket?|Mavericks|11
the main reason is travel, but its 2016 now. time to adjust|Spurs|5
oh well, airplanes cannot adjust as easy.||2
So can we stop pretending like any other teams are close to Golden State's level right now? The series against the Thunder was an absolute worst case scenario (part of which was the Thunder playing really well, credit to them) but they still pulled it out. I was a bit too young to really judge the mid-90s Bulls as it was happening, but Golden State on the whole has been the best basketball team I've ever seen, and clearly so.|Rockets|18

#CURRY LEADING REBOUNDER EVEN AFTER SITTING 3RD QUARTER|Warriors|23
If Kyrie doesn't show some fire in game 3, and make his talents and presence felt, Cavs should just start the lineup that won them 2 games last year. This is a fucking joke. They need to play defense to win these games and they're simply getting pushed around. Warriors have been galvanized and are playing absolutely ferocious d, but on the offensive end they are wrecking shop inside and out. I expect Mozgov to get non-garbage time minutes in Game 3. If he does not, Lue is a fucking fraud and has no place coaching this team. Cavs need to play HUNGRY on defense. More tipped balls, more fifty fifty balls, more hard fouls, more forced turnovers, more blocked shots. I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure they have the personnel for those things. |[GSW] Klay Thompson|16
The Warriors already found the solution to that line up at the end of game 3 last year which meant they comfortably won games 4, 5 and 6. At this point it won't make a difference. ||2
From a defensive standpoint I'd say this lineup is addition and subtraction and last years finals was at least algebra. They need size. |[GSW] Klay Thompson|1
They played hard in the beginning of the game. A lot of forced turnovers, tipped passes, etc. The off-ball switching with GS setting all those screens really fucked things up underneath and gave GS a lot of easy points. But once it was clear that LBJ was the only player that might have a decent game for CLE (besides RJ like everyone keeps pointing out) then the effort level hit rock bottom.||3
I don't expect them to go down without a fight in Game 3, obviously. But you can't wait until then to start playing in the Finals. So many players not playing with intensity.|[GSW] Klay Thompson|1

The series isn't *totally* over.  However, if Cleveland doesn't win by double digits in Game 3, you can turn out the lights.  Cavs need to show they can make adjustments and completely outplay the W's in Cleveland.  Then, they'll have to steal game 5 to have a realistic chance.|Trail Blazers|4

I don't think even the most confident among us said they didn't stand a chance. Hell I thought we were gonna win the series, but holy shit the Warriors are on some next level shit. |Cavaliers|6
I expected the Warriors to win the series, but I expected the series to be more competitive. As posted in this thread, we're truly seeing how bad of a coach Tyron Lue really is, VERY little adjustments in the game and is not utilizing the role players around LeBron. David Blatt is master-bating to this, while the Cav FO just had an aneurysm ||3
Can we start talking about how JR Smith completely disappears in the NBA Finals? Fucking nuts.||6
Who thinks LeBron's Heat team would've played the Warriors better? Bosh could defend Draymond well just saying. |West|5
you mean a past team right? Since Bosh couldn't play this year, but yeah a past Heat team would probably challenge this warriors team to 7 if not win. \n\nI just don't think Kevin Love and Kyrie Irving are viable against elite teams. You can't be bad on defense and call yourself a star player.||2
I'm not so sure. I'd take the Warriors in 6, maybe 7. The Heat were far from invincible and this Warriors squad won 73 games. Plus I don't think that Heat team wins the matchup battle either (I'd say about they're about even).|Warriors|0

Survey for Cavs fans:  Would y\'all honestly be mad if LeBron said "Fuck this, I\'m out"?  He\'s shown where his heart is...isn\'t that enough?  \n\nI feel really sad thinking about what the legacy of one of the greatest players ever could end up looking like if he stays in Cleveland.|Grizzlies|6
[Not a Cavs fan] If he leaves again to go to another team that is already established, his legacy will go to shit. He saved face by returning to CLE and taking them back to the Finals two years in a row, if he leaves again after times get tough, he'll look like a coward. \n\nEDIT: On top of that, if he goes somewhere out West it's no guarantee he'll make to back to the finals, and there no team in the East he can go to that has anymore talent than CLE has right now. |Lakers|7
I feel like lebron going to the west and taking a non playoff team to a championship is the only way he can prove a point now. And if lebron were to leave the east then the WCF really would be the finals from now on, with a celebratory series after.|[LAL] Kobe Bryant|1

This may be a crazy idea to most of you, but I would bring Irving and Love off the bench. Give them the closing minutes in the 4th if needed. These guys are such defensive liabilities, last yrs team is actually better than this one. I honestly feel they are better suited as bench players. If they are serious about winning, Lue needs to consider this for game 3.|[CLE] LeBron James|7
Love is out with a concussion. we're fucked|Cavaliers|2
Nah, maybe someone will play defense at that position now.|Cavaliers|3
You might be better off, Jefferson is playing better then Love this series.  Dude is nonexistent on defense, and his failures there are bleeding into his offense\n\nYou guys are a better team without him and Kyrie||4

Cavs aren't battle tested. The 5th best team in the west gives the east's 2nd best team a run for their money. Must be nice to waltz in to the finals unscathed, but this is the price for that. Hopefully 2 games will be enough for them to adjust to the level of play or this series is over. |Spurs|6
offensively, LeBron's decline as a player is a big deal. I know we try to pretend like it's not, but I'm gonna go ahead and say that it's IMPOSSIBLE for the Cavs to beat anybody actually half decent until he regains his jumper. Otherwise, it's just too hard to score points...he might be able to lift a dreadful supporting cast to something that's not awful, like he did in last year's Finals, but there's a very low ceiling to the team offense against a defense like this, ESPECIALLY with defenders that can match up very well with LeBron. Even with superior offensive talent now, they're struggling to score, and it comes down to LeBron having the same serious flaws he had when he was a kid going up against SA or Boston...except he doesn't have the same motor and insane explosion off the dribble to somewhat combat that. 07/08 LeBron, THAT LeBron could have played better if he had better offensive help...but this LeBron doesn't have the off-the-dribble explosion anymore, and coupled with the lack of a jumper, he just can't do much offensively without ball stopping, grinding the offense to a halt, and just playing generally ugly basketball. All the offensive help in the world doesn't mean **** when he can't do anything off the dribble.||6
why can't LeBron shoot 3's?||1
I love lebron but I begrudgingly agree with you. Lebron can\'t continue to be the "greatest" player in the world unless he develops an outside game \xc3\xa0 la Jordan. He isn\'t finishing as well against contact as he used to and isn\'t getting as many calls. |Pelicans|3

Dude. They blew through that conference like a train vs. hay. \n\nWestern Conference is extremely over powered|Warriors|6
I thought that this was the year the Western Conference was overrated. /s||3
Was that game embarrassing for Cleveland? Yes.\n\nBut the reality is, they're the 4th best team in a 3 team league. And the margin between 1-3 and 4 is wider than we thought.|Warriors|26
Did we see a Cavs-Spurs/Thunder series ?||-1
No, but we just saw an extremely competitive Dubs/OKC series. We're not seeing a remotely competitive Dubs/Cavs series.|Warriors|1
Or the Warriors just match up well against the Cavs. The Cavs did beat OKC both times they played this season. |Cavaliers|-3

Pretty much|[PHO] Amar'e Stoudemire|1
Yes, that's exactly what I meant.|Warriors|2
Yes.|Warriors|2
I think that's who he meant . ||2
I just dont understand how you dont play Frye anymore. You dont even give the guy a chance to show that he can play his game and not be that bad on defense. Cleveland adjusts too much to GSW that they disrupt their own formula. You can't win if the other team just dictates everything and only you adjust. You have to put something on the table. |Cavaliers|11
I'm not seeing what Frye brings to the table. No rebounding, no rim protection just 3 pt range?|Warriors Bandwagon|2
His length is good enough on defense from what I've seen in the playoffs. He doesnt need to block shots. Having better spacing for Lebron to work with is always good. I just dont get why he doesnt even crack 10 mins. And it's not like Thompson is gobbling up offensive rebounds the past two games either. |Cavaliers|2
Frye at the 5 definitely doesn't do anything, GSW will just happily play the Death lineup. Frye at the 4 in the starting line up gives you a little bit of extra length and maybe a little bit of quickness. If you're replacing Frye with Love, CLE loses Love's rebounding. Not sure what the end result will be.\n\n> Having better spacing for Lebron to work with is always good.\n\nThis is the exact reason why CLE is down 2-0. Having Lebron attack the basket for 48 minutes is just not sustainable offense in the Finals. It worked earlier in the playoffs because no other team had an answer for guarding Lebron, and CLE had an easier time on defense because no East team had secondary methods of scoring. That's not the case during the Finals. CLE needs to start running plays for JR, Kyrie, Shumpert, anybody but Lebron. Lebron can facilitate, but he cannot be ball-dominant for 48 minutes. His body just won't hold up. |Warriors Bandwagon|1
I specified Lebron but it's not only him that will benefit from the spacing. Right now, Lebron can't even attack the basket a lot because a) AI b) they just swarm him with help defense anyway.\n\n I just want them really to impose a little bit of will in the games because GSW is just toying with them. Doesnt have to be this Frye adjustment alone. thanks for your input.|Cavaliers|1
Frye's length doesn't mean anything when he's too slow to close out on shooters like Adams/ibaka, Frye was never a shot blocker. Thompson is an enigma, he should be beasting on the boards|Lakers|2
GSW is doing a great job of gang rebounding. One of my problems with the Cavs rn is they're getting beat on the boards and most of the time still give up transition points. Not enough effort overall. |Cavaliers|2
And this is why they shouldn't have fired Blatt. He looked at who was successful against the Warriors and tried to emulate that. Lue (and LeBron) tried to emulate the Warriors themselves and it's just played right into the Warriors hands.|Warriors|3

Its probably a good thing, they got few days to recover and playing at home. What's the worst that could happen?|Spurs|1
Loss by 5 ?|West|2
Was it just me or Lebron was super bad tonight? He had 2 turnovers off of travels IN A ROW! He also took some really dumb shots. All in all, this cleveland offense is just 1 or 2 pick and rolls, then a chucked up shot by someone or a turnover. If I were the Cavs, I would really rethink that Blatt firing...|Heat|5
He's traveled like that his entire career. Bizarrely, they actually called him on it last night.||2
I caught that too. Finally!|Lakers|1
I don't understand the point of the spoiler tag. The title spoils everything...||7
I wonder what it's like being leborn. Does he spend his nights frustrated that every time a team assembled for him is basically a fraction of the talent the west is putting together\nAnd that it's all just a bitter struggle to prop up his teams each night only to realize it's simply impossible for one man to defeat 5?||5
The man is making millions upon millions of dollars. I am sure that in the grand scheme of things, he is just fine. |Spurs|4
In most cases the players that don't care end up like Carmelo and Kobe etc, and sit on a team refusing to take pay cuts or trades to win a championship. \n\nLebron seems like he wants to break this stupid Jordan comparison he's been attributed with and simply can't because it's simply not feasible for a eastern team.||-1
> In most cases the players that don't care end up like Carmelo and Kobe etc, and sit on a team refusing to take pay cuts or trades to win a championship.\n\nKobe has 5 though. You are talking as if he refused to take paycut and just retired with 0 rings.\n||1
No I'm not, he spent 4 years trying to prove he could do it without shaq and then just checked out and spent 6 years throwing up jumpers from 60 feet out because cutting him simply couldn't be done.||-1
He went to the Finals 3 times and won 2 without Shaq.||2
He went to the finals much more than 3 times.||-6
>"After that game, I said, \'This guy is the best player in the world,\'" O\'Neal said about Bryant\'s performance in an episode of The Big Podcast with Shaq last year. \n\nBoth Shaq and Kobe needed eachother. The above is said by Shaq himself during the 3peat unless you\'re trying to prove you know more than Shaq.\n\n>spent 6 years throwing up jumpers from **60 feet out**\n\nNow this is just exaggerating to make yourself look good lmao||2
No, I'm pretty sure his 60foot jumper was even highlighted by this exact subreddit mostly because it wasn't done at the end of a quarter or half||-1
If LeBron wants to drop the Jordan comparisons he needs to drop the "King James" moniker.|Charlotte Hornets|2
He must really love that nickname to have it tatooed all over his body. |Magic|1
He didn't dub himself that, you can't just negate a nickname your fans gave you.||1
No, he didn't dub himself that, but he ran with it and made millions off of that nickname. If you are ok with calling yourself the King you ought to be able to handle the flack when you do not perform as such.|Charlotte Hornets|2
I mean, he performed well enough to make 6 straight NBA finals and 2 rings. He's still the King, albeit with a few losses along the way. At least he got there, its more than a lot of his contemporaries ever did. ||1
I'm not disputing how great of a player LeBron is, but he isn't the King. The term king means that he rules over the league, and last chance I checked the ruler of the league is the champion.|Charlotte Hornets|1
lol no. A king is a ruler, sure, but he can take losses of men or territory at times. If you're in the battle every year for 6 years (6 straight trips to the finals) it means you are one of the top players in the league and the King...even if you lose sometimes. \n\nKing James was a play on the King James bible, it was a nickname that fit. And he's definitely lived up to expectations. Still the best player in the league imo, and has been for many years. ||1
You know what happens to a King that loses the battle, they aren\'t king anymore. The initial post was about people stopping comparing Lebron to Jordan, and a big reason why is his willingness to go along with calling himself "King James." Yes, it was a play on words of the King James Bible, but still doesn\'t change the fact he he calls himself the king. I would think someone who calls himself the King would be winning more battles. Again, this isn\'t diminishing his accomplishments, which are great, but the comparisons to Jordan are never going to stop, and his nickname has a lot to do with it, that is just reality.|Charlotte Hornets|1
You can't hold lebron to expectations it's not fair...|Mavericks|3
This Finals is boring as fuck. GSW are great but its fucking boring\n\nEDIT : Pretty sure got downvoted by GSW fans. ||6
Did it get more fun? :) ||2
Lol XD. You're going through all this now!?||1
I googled something about the game and this showed up... I was like.. I'm pretty sure everyone thought it was over by game 2. Hahaha. It's a good feeling as a Cavs fan.||1
Loved Kyrie's game man... I kinda wanted him mvp. No doubt lebron performed.. But that 3 at 1 min to go.. was what sealed the deal for me... :)||1
Lebron got them there though.. Down by 4, he made a 3 point play and then shot a 3 to tie it after Warrior's bucket. And then the Block- that's when Kyrie shot his three.. Disregard the million missed shots and turnovers in between those.. I had to watch a highlight reel just recently to even remember what happened. Those last 5 minutes were a blur. ||1
You make it sound like 1975 again.|Cavaliers|2
As a true Lebron hater and someone who loves watching beautiful offense I disagree. In having fun watching him get his ass whooped. |Magic|7
Cuyahoga Ohio born here. It's over. I'll give out 30 golds if the Cavs come back and win the series.||5
Man, this is a great forum to revisit. ||2
Deliver!|NBA|3
Man, people talk about the warriors offense but their defense really impresses me. They're constantly on their men, rarely make defensive, don't get lost, always contests shots, keep men from penetrating, etc and their offense makes it so that the other team is always rushing for points because GS can make it a blowout in literally 1 minute. |Rockets|5
They look like their defensive selves from last year.|[NYK] Jamal Crawford|2
An all time great team shows up THAT ALSO MATCHES UP PERFECTLY WITH US just to stop us from winning after LeBron comes home. \n\nIf that doesn't scream curse, idk what does. |Cavaliers|22
A creepy old lady pointing at you screaming "curse" in an Eastern European accent?||4
If it wasn't Golden State, it would have been OKC.  If it wasn't going to be OKC, it would have been San Antonio.  If GSW, OKC, and SAS didn't exist, Cleveland might have been able to beat the Clippers--maybe.  |Warriors|12
The circlejerk is real |Cavaliers|-1
I don't really think it's a circlejerk to suggest that two different 67-win teams would beat Cleveland in a series or that OKC with a near identical record (and that was up 3-1 on GS) could either.\n\nIt's definitely not a given, but don't get how it's a circlejerk.||3
The circlejerk is that OKC would wipe the floor with us, when 1) we would have home court advantage, 2) LeBron has always dominated KD matchups, and 3) were 4-0 vs okc since his return and match up well against them. \n\nThe Warriors are not only very good, but matchup vs us very well. It's a nightmare. |Cavaliers|0

Hopefully Simmons isn't on this thread.||1
http://i1138.photobucket.com/albums/n535/benn1ce/toucher.png||12
Exactly. Yet the blame will be placed on everyone but LeBron||2
It'll go on Lue|Warriors|2
Some things I noticed after watching Game 2:\n\n* The Cavs tried hard as hell to run offense through Curry (+ extra handsy defense to get in his head) in the 3rd as a way to try to get Curry a 4th foul. While it eventually did work by chance (fastbreak), the Cavs offense looked completely out of rhythm and it never recovered.\n* Jefferson was Lue's answer to Livingston/Barnes abusing Kyrie. While it did prevent easy midrange shots, it also forced other Cavs to help harder on D since switching becomes less effective (you can't switch Jefferson onto Curry or Klay). This meant a lot more going under the screen or LeBron helping a bit too much which = open Dray 3s.\n* The Cav's vaunted big men/offensive rebounding has been neutralized by all of the cuts made by Curry and Klay. It puts the Cavs bigs out of position for offensive rebounding making it much easier for the Warriors to box out. This only works because Lue has to compensate for Kyrie and Love's poor D (less Delly and Moz, though Moz looks pretty dead post injury). Blatt's plan of a slower paced game with defense over offense is starting to look better by the day.\n* It's hard to tell with Curry's foul-limited minutes this game, but it looks like he's made an adjustment to the Cav's extra handsy off-ball D. He's picking up the pace (if that's even possible) and making faster decisions after getting the ball. That gives the Cavs less time to communicate about switching or staying at home and is causing all sorts of havoc off of hockey passes.\n\nIt's as if the Warriors weren't satisfied with just winning. They went into the second game with the goal of completely dismantling any perceived advantages that the Cavs had in Game 1, and it worked. Kerr showed up with adjustments on top of adjustments to Game 2 while Lue showed up with a single change to his game plan. That is not enough for the Cavs to close the gap.||10
Oh look, it\'s the "LEBRON HAD NO HELP!" wagon turning its wheels again. \n\nThis isn\'t 2007 for those fuckboys who actually believe that still applies. |Raptors|10

Love is so gone from that team next year. |Trail Blazers|4
Where though? |Raptors|1
All of the Cavs are looking at James to pull some magic off every single play down the court. Team looks disoriented, I'd be surprised if the series ends up going 5. |Knicks|5
Kevin Love has not won a single playoff game west of Lake Michigan, how long will this streak continue?|Lakers|4
jr smith has 5 points total in this series, lmao|Bulls|4
No way Durant leaves now. He now sees if he beats the Warriors it's an automatic title. Seriously. The cavs are playing like they were thrown into the series. |Trail Blazers|3
They are a role player away. KD should stay one more year. He'll catch a bigger check that way with or without a title. |Celtics|1
Not saying this is my opinion, but counterpoint: If he goes out east he only has to beat Lebron to get to the Finals. \n\nThen once he gets there, who knows what shape the team who emerges from the Western Conference Bloodbath is in. |Lakers|2
What bloodbath? There will only be the Spurs left to challenge GS and then KD will still have to play the Warriors in the finals but with a less talented team than OKC...|Thunder|0
The West would still be a bloodbath even if Kevin left. Even if you think Golden State and the Spurs would be in a class all there own, the rest of the conference's best are all scary and only getting scarier. Even an Okc team without KD could make it to the playoffs and be a tough out for someone. \n\nIf the Clippers aren't injured they are a tougher out than anyone Lebron faced in the east. I don't mean no disrespect to Toronto Fans, but I think had the basketball gods not taken CP3 and Blake in the same day that team would be the favorite against Toronto in a series. \n\nThen there are all of the young teams who are coming. The Blazers this year looked like they are in the same position OKC was in 2010.\n\nThe point is there is a whole tier of teams out west who will fuck your shit up that don't exist out east. The decline from the top is soo steep out east. |Lakers|1

[This series for the Cavs](http://imgur.com/F9mpM13)|Knicks|3
The Cavs front court combo of Tristan Thompson and Kevin Love has been terrible for them. They have to do something different with the starting lineup at the least. I don't know who should start at all-- I'm just saying those two shouldn't be together on the floor together for that much time, especially early on which seemed to lead to a lot of dubs' runs. Maybe Lue should start frye/anyone else or have love come off the bench because TT/Love is getting roasted on defense and isn't doing enough on the offensive end to make up for their horrendous defense. And Lebron needs to be more aggressive. I understand needing to get your teammates in the flow of the game, but when your team is getting stomped he needs to step up and shoulder the scoring and playmaking load like he's done before (I'm a huge lebron fan in case that sounds like hate). |Pelicans|3

cleveland is allowing golden state's d to come to life. what really hurt the warriors in the okc series was okc's ability to penetrate and get offensive rebounds, so you had a defense which was on its heels and had to work every possession. cleveland seems to do best with mixing up their offense, posting lebron sometimes, but ultimately moving the ball, cutting to the hoop, and driving to the basket which they did at times tonight and it seemed effective. cleveland did miss some open looks, love imparticularly, which he would normally hit. this is a salvageable series, cleveland just needs more offensive sets run well, a defense that outrebounds gsw, and coaching and film studies to fix the mental errors and come to play game 3 with a clean conscious.|San Diego Clippers|3

Durant definitely has the best shot at a title with OKC right now. But what if he went to Boston for example?

Trying really hard not to overreact and please tell me if i am, but shouldnt ty lue play kyrie a lot less than he is? He's a complete liability on defense. And if he's not producing offensively and missing a ton of shots, isnt he an all around liability? |Hawks|3
Kyrie butterfingers. Man is he garbage this series|[NBA] LeBron James|3
Stephen A sure hyped up a very ordinary Stephen A performance |Mavs|3
GSW w/ 20 TO's and still win by that much?! Damn. |Bulls|3
I was so wrong in my prediction.  Never been more glad to be wrong |Lakers|3
Can't believe Harrison Barnes is going to get a max deal this post season.|[TOR] Jonas Valanciunas|3
I am still not counting the Cavs out. I didn't doubt the Raptors and I won't doubt the guys who beat them. Fuck you Bill Simmons.\n\nThat said, if Warriors win game 3 I'm just going to shitpost about Kyrie and Lebron going to the Celtics to coach them into 1st seed.|Heat|3
Tyronn Lue can kiss his job goodbye unless they turn this one trick pony around! ||3

Its nice to think that we stood a real chance of winning the finals, except its not.|Thunder|3
I'm just thinking what could've been if Lebron kept Wiggins?|Knicks|3
They probably don't win a title.|NBA|1
LeBron looks slow and old for some reason.  Or maybe he's not as athletic as he once was.  I think he's going to have a quick drop-off from here on out.||3
I was saying that last year. He doesn't have as much lift anymore. He is 31 though, this is when things start charging |Lakers|1
I think he stopped exercising quite as much over the offseason when he went to the Cavs due to back problems. It's going to catch up with him hard.|Heat|2
Nah, Father Time catches up to everyone. He need to pull a Jordan, reinvent his game to include more post ups and fade aways. As he slows down speed wise he should use his bulk to destroy guys in the post. Too bad he had always hated post play. |Magic|1
Sums it up right here...\n\nhttps://twitter.com/NBALEAD/status/739656185217875973|Braves|3
I knew the game was over when GSW started off slow and the Cavs didn't go up 20 to 6 in the first 6 minutes to show they have a pulse. Since they have no pulse, I'm calling them dead... flatline... 2 more zombie games and it's a sweep.|Heat|3
who would have thought that OKC-CAVS would be better competition and tv rate-wise for NBA. nobody ain't tuning in that shit show where GSW whip Cavs|Thunder|3
I think OKC would whip the Cavs too though it wouldn't start off with 2 blow out games since the series would have started in Cleveland.|Hawks|2
exactly, then it would be better tv Ratings for NBA. ironically NBA really wanted that matchup that ended up being boring series|Thunder|1
SSSSSWWWWWEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEPPPPPPPPPPPPP||3
Sweep what?|NBA|1
I think next game should just be the Warriors bench vs the cavs. As Thompson put it 'it's fun to watch'||3
[deleted]||3
HIs defense wasn't that great though> overall the effort level hasn't been there|Celtics|1
Alright here's how it turns out for Cleveland. They get swept, or lose in 5.  \nGM LeBron decides to do an entire roster overhaul this offseason.  \n\nTrade Love to the Wizards for Markieff + Gortat. Wizards do it in an attempt to whoo Durant, and Love would thrive in the drive and kick offense Wall creates. Gortat keeps playing solid, and is best center Cleveland has had in a while, Kief returns to 2014-2015 form with LeBron's leadership.  \n\nMemphis does a sign and trade of Conley + Carter + '17 1st for Irving + Trade Exception (as Conley's new contract is likely pretty high). Irving thrives on a defensive team led by Gasol and Allen while Memphis' offense is revitalized with Irving's ball-handling and shooting. Conley becomes level headed veteran PG LeBron's always wanted. Retain JR, Delly. Let Mozgov walk, sign Dudley, Mahinmi cheap. Cavs could use the '17 1st from Memphis for a sign and trade of any players if necessary.\n\nRoll into next season with a team of..  \nGortat / Mahinmi  \nKief / TT  \nLeBron / Dudley  \nJR / VC / Shump  \nConley / Delly  \n\nwas thinking they should sign Seth Curry, maybe instead of Delly or as well as, so when they return to their third straight Finals against GSW (after beating DET in 7 in the ECF) Curry having to step in for the injured Delly, torches his brother's team off the bench and helps lead Cleveland to victory in 6.  \n\nWhile obviously ridiculous, I think the Love and Irving trades could be realistic.|[DET] Chauncey Billups|3
Love before kyrie kyrie is fucking nasty but his defence is hot fucking garbage |West|1
So, how about that Western Conference Finals?|Warriors|3
This Cavs team couldn't beat any championship team in history. The Warriors are great... But their competition for the Finals have been as weak as it gets so far. I appreciate a dominant team as much as the next fan, but I just wish we were getting better basketball out of this.|Supersonics|3
Well you got it.|NBA|1
The Thunder series was good basketball -- it's definitely going to end up being the true finals matchup for this year.|Magic|3

Wow that was pathetic.|Thunder|3
The cavaliers must be happy, at least the team have a great chemistry in the locker room.\nDavid blatt must be happy...||3

BREAKING NEWS:   David Stern to come out of retirement for game 3 in order to institute a new rule called "SPOT CLEVELAND 20 POINTS AT THE START OF THE GAME."  ||3

Livingston's a beast, anyone remembers his fake and left-hand 2-point score near the rim on the 6th match against OKC? That was beauty!||3
I miss the days when Draymond Green was OKC's little bitch.||3
I think it's time to rid the league of 2 separate conferences, just seed the entire league by record.||3
Golden state seem to be on fire, after the 3-1 come back it seems like it got em going 110% as a team, even without the stars all firing at once \n\nThis video sums up how I feel they are atm\n\nhttps://youtu.be/eg5Hntrrlho|[GSW] Marreese Speights|3
not enjoying these finals at all, i hope the cavs can be more competitive in their home games.|Knicks|3
As a Hawks Fan, I would feel perfectly comfortable with KLove or Kyrie in our system. Can't wait to see which one Lebron throws away.|Hawks|3
I think he'd get rid of Love befor Kyrie. Love is very fragile it seems.||1
Which would allow us to let Horford walk. I'm ok with that. |Hawks|2
Sweeep|Raptors|3
Could be... But then it also made sense to say that in the ECF...|Raptors|1
Let me live out my Lebron hating dreams damnit!|Raptors|1
I try to hate him... but I can't.|Raptors|1
Shit, I can.|Thunder|1
Even if Curry doesnt shoot, he is still a rebound MONSTER|Pistons|3
After two games in the Finals, Lebron is leading the Cavs in points, rebounds, assists, and tied for 1st in steals and blocks. \n\nHe's getting literally no help|Cavaliers|14
You guys clearly need a healthy Kyrie and Love|Warriors|2
Don't forget the other stat he leads in:  Turnovers.||7
I think for the Cavaliers it's clearly mental at this point, cuz they have the talent and good depth, maybe not enough to beat GS but it should be more competitive than this for sure... but guys are playing timid, and aren't making their shots. They get demoralized too easily. |Raptors|7
Yes. I really thought it would be much tougher. But there are many games to go|Warriors|2

If they go to a 1-16 format, Lebron will never make the finals again. No chance NBA does that before he retires.|Knicks|5
How is one conference so much worse than the other lol.. The nba has got to be embarrassed by this post season. M|[GSW] Shaun Livingston|4
In theory, since the east is so shit, it should encourage stars to move over and balance out the league. They just have to beat Lebron to get to the finals. While i'm not saying that's easy, it's easier than having to go through multiple top drawer teams. \n\nSo why doesn't it happen?? KD going to the East would be so good for the comp||1
Should just eliminate the conferences and take the best 16 by record|Wizards|2
That would have just gave us more east teams in the playoffs this year.|[LAL] Kobe Bryant|1
#EXACLY |[GSW] Shaun Livingston|2
Lets not act like Lebron has been playing that well. He had just as many turnovers as FG's made tonight. I see people acting like he's carrying the Cavs. Nah, he's playing like shit too (by his standards). ||4
It's pretty bad when he is playing so poorly (by his standards) and still considered carrying the team, horrible performances by his supporting cast good god|Wizards|1
Yeah he needs to step it up for sure. There were moments this game where he looked dominant, but he couldn't keep it up.|[GSW] Klay Thompson|2
What an embarrassment.  I'm ashamed to be a Cavs fan tonight.|Cavaliers|4
? Team's performance has nothing to do with you as a fan. Nothing to be ashamed of |Raptors|1
Delly is going to "accidentally" injure Kylie and love in practice and the roster will be just like last years and they will come back and lose in 5. |Vancouver Grizzlies|5

If I am Adam Silver I would give FMVP award to LeBron James. As a consolation prize... Because Warriors been playing team basketball too much and you just dont know who deserves the award when you have 6 or 7 guys bullying Cavs at the sametime...|Lakers|5
That was my argument with friends last season. Lebron played his heart out against a healthy GSW. |Hawks|1
The only reason the Cavaliers lost is because they scored less points than the Warriors.|Bulls|6

I think you missed the joke|Knicks|3
I cant believe people are still using the argument "well the Cavs were playing so well in the East Coast Playoffs" Like that means anything when  you beat the Charlotte Hornets ~~Bobcats~~\n\nThats like Kentucky in college. They love to boast about their record. But you play in the SEC, a horrendous basketball conference. Of course your record is good. \n\nI wonder if Lebron will get his team another pair of shitty headphones and a hallmark card. |Spurs|3
Or a trophy.|Supersonics|1
First off, we lost to the Heat. Get your facts straight.|Charlotte Hornets|1
I know. I was just using y'all as a baseline for how I view the entire east coast conference. |Spurs|-1
It was nice of the broadcast team to give a shout out to the WNBA. I'm sure the Cavs appreciated the recognition.||8
Its a little bittersweet knowing this is the last game at oracle this season. |Warriors|13
That makes no sense its a humble brag and not necessary.|Warriors|-11

Emo kids didn't look like that until closer to the mid 00's.  Emo kids in the 90's dressed more like Russell Westbrook ala two years ago.  Or Weezer.  Same difference.||0
Why do people make it seem like it's our fault that we play in the East and had no competition in the playoffs? |Cavaliers|2
It\'s not your fault, but when cavs fans say "look, our offense is finally coming  together. The warriors won\'t be able to defend Frye and love on the outside," people point out how weak the east is.|Warriors|2
Why do people get mad at the other team when they don't like what the refs do?||5

To be fair before he got hurt last year Irving looked both willing and able to approximate defense.  And even now I assume he's going to score eventually.||1

Did not expect that 2nd half.  The Cavs seemed really hungry in the 1st half.  They were creating turnovers. Lebron had an awesome 2nd quarter. Yeah, they were down, but they dominated the last 3 minutes of the half. And then...\n\n\n\n\n|Warriors|2
Get out of Cleveland, LeBron. I know you want to win one for the city. It's very admirable of you. But it's sad when I see this team not just lose, they also play with no heart. You owe the city nothing. Screw the critics if they call you out for leaving. The man can't win here.||2
damn AI with 7 pts +28|Warriors Bandwagon|2
If the Thunder were in this I actually think the physical mis-match would have made this even more lopsided (assuming we saw playoff Thunder and not regular season Thunder).||2
Welp I have to credit the Warriors D. They are running out on the perimeter a lot harder than we are. Yeah we are cold as fuck but they have a lot to do with it. I won't give up till after game 3, but I'm probably about as shook as the Cavs. |Cavaliers|2

It's funny, Lebron has better players than last year, but he seems to have way less support then last year. |Knicks|2
I think its a mental thing. When you have "star" players on your team, you expect them to do their job, you do your best to share and get them involve, as a result you\'re not yourself. Last year he had no one, so he took him on himself.|Spurs|3
Yeah exactly, and I think that lends to everyone else too, everyone besides Lebron and Jefferson have been underperforming compared to what they've shown throughout these playoffs and what they did in the finals last year.|Knicks|1

Going back to [this](http://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/what-the-cavaliers-must-do-to-beat-the-warriors-in-the-nba-finals/) article, what the Cavs need to do to win the series: \n\n1. ~~TT must have a great series, not a good one~~\n\n2. ~~Efficient shooting~~\n\n3. ~~Avoid TOs and outrebound the Warriors~~\n\n4. Don\'t make the Warriors angry (what\'s there to be angry about)\n\n5. KLove doesn\'t become a deffensive liability (technically speaking, he didn\'t mention anything about Irving being a liability)\n\n6. ~~Lebron is the best player in the series~~ Clearly that\'s Barbosa.\n\nIn all seriousness... it\'s not looking good for the Cavs. Execution wise I expect them to do a lot better at home and take at least one game there, but I feel like the biggest mismatch so far is Ty-Kerr, let\'s see if he can do more than just make their players "feel comfortable"||2

the thing is, there was no reason for it too! Love said he was going to sing what the Cavs no matter what.  Then the cavs went and traded away their number 1 pick! WTF were they thinking?? lol||2
Curious, do you have a source on love saying that?|Cavaliers|1
Ill go look! lol\n\nedit:  Dam i cant find it.  But I do remember that for sure.  It was when Lebron decided he wanted to go to the cavs.  Love made a statement like, no matter who is traded to or whatever, he\'s gonna sign with cleveland at the end of his contract.  I think with Lebron\'s return, Cleveland\'s Management went into a "win now" mode and felt they needed to get love instead of wait around for wiggins to develop\n||1
I'm hoping the Warriors win again because of the accomplishments they achieved this season, but the Cavs need to do some changes. If Dellavedova is shooting more shots than JR Smith, then something is wrong. You need JR's 3 point shots. And K.Love needs to get it together. With that being said, go Warriors. \n\nHopefully my Bulls team makes a comeback next season.|Bulls|2

Close prediction...||1
let's be real though, that was totally a more likely prediction than the craziness that ended up happening |Mavericks|1
Well, I was saying- it very well coulda been 5 games. ||1
Man I'm so happy the warriors are up two games. Hopefully they bring home the championship.||2
Cavs can't rebound for shit, they give easy buckets to GS inside, they waste their shot clock forgoing decent looks just to turn the ball over. These games could be at least somewhat close if people besides LeBron and RJ gave a shit. Shumpert and Del should just quit basketball btw they're an embarrassment||2
I love the Warriors but I kinda feel bad for Kevin Love.||2

good thing lebron made them sign TT to that big contract. ||2
Indeed.|NBA|1
[deleted]||1
well he delivered 5 rebounds and 5 points last night||1
Nobody (with the possible exception of Irving) on the Cavs wants to shoot the ball. They all hesitate. When the shot is there take it. When the mismatch is there work it. I want to see a good competitive series but it wont happen until the Cavs come to play. ||2
Everyone was saying the Cav's rolled through the playoffs. But the played Atlanta, Boston and Toronto. No REAL competition. They were not ready.|Raptors|2
Maybe they weren't. But they stepped it up before it was too late.|NBA|1
Does someone have a picture of Lue absolutely devastated when the camera caught him in the background in the 4th(?) quarter?|Cavaliers|2
If LeBron gets swept in the finals, it's really going to hurt his GOAT legacy. |Lakers|4
making to 6 finals is already great\nbut to win is a different story and he wont be up their with kobe, duncan etc however individually he is GOAT|Spurs|-2
If he makes it to 7 more, he'll tie Russell. Think that'll happen?|[BOS] Larry Bird|1
He breezed through east without breaking a sweat lol wont be surprised.|Spurs|1
If this was 21, I agree with you, but its a team sport, and having lost 5 out of 7 trips to the finals has to take away from his accomplishments. |Lakers|1
what more is he supposed to do? nobody is showing up|Cavaliers|-2
Lets not act like he played well either. He had 8 TOs, two of which were travels. |Lakers|7
He's not even close to being considered the greatest.  He's not even in the top 5.||1
lmao are you drunk? almost everyone on any sports network puts him top 5 already... on top of that he has atleast 5 years left in the tank. |Pistons|3
Top Five?  \n\n1. Magic\n2. Jordan\n3. Bird\n4. Russell \n5. Kareem \n\nAnother top five: \n\n1. Hakeem\n2. Shaq \n3. Maravich \n4. West \n5. Drexler \n\nLeBron isn't even on the same planet. \n||0
bird, west, pete and drexler over lebron? okay your opinion is officially void lmao i guess it isn't a surprise that you're not a sports journalist |Pistons|-6
what do the sports journalists say then||0
how bout now?|Supersonics|1
ROFL.  Lebron *might* be top 10.  *Might*.  Top five?  Keep dreaming.  Maybe he'll be legit top 5 at the end of his career, but certainly not now.  \n\n||1
go to espn and see where they put lebron in the top 5.. it might ruin your day lol |Pistons|-6
I care not what ESPN says.  ESPN shows pro-gaming and billiards now.  They're hardly the paragon of sports television anymore.||1
I see no problems with that, sports aren't always on. but regardless, every ex nba player and nba analyst has him in the top ten |Pistons|1
I'm fine with him being in the top ten.  Remember, though, I was responding to your comment that he would be even considered for greatest of all time.  Now we're in agreement that he's top ten.  That's a huge difference.||1
I think GOAT is starting to be out of the question for Lebron. This will be his 13th season, and through 13 seasons, Jordan already had 6 championships.  I don't think Lebron will be able to match the championships, and his peak was never as good as Jordan's.|Bulls|2
I completely agree, I'm with you, I don't think he has a chance to catch MJ. But as some other in /r/nba like to argue about LeBron being GOAT, I think if he has two finals sweeps (one was understandable) there is no way he will ever be put on the same pedestal. |Lakers|1
Can we all agree now that Draymond is Top 10?  The guy is a beast!|Warriors|6
Umm. That would be why he's in the All NBA 2nd team this year.|Thunder|1

Lebron being a control freak, firing Blatt (who was my favorite thing about that team) and replacing him with a lesser coach, over rated players, the general attitude of the players, and Ohio is just a shitty place all around.||1

Everything thing is gonna be okay for LeBron.  His agent is already working the phones to see how he can get on the Warriors next year.  LBJ fine with coming off of the bench.||3
He'd be our 7th guy. Iggy still is 6th.|Wizards|1
I may be downvoted to nothing here...but is it the craziest thing that what you lost in offensive production when Kyrie and Love are out you gain more in defense and rebounding with Delly and Thompson? Last years team at this point was tougher on the warriors in both games (obvs by CLE winning game 2)|Warriors|2
Cavs fans be like we didn't have a healthy David Blatt|Heat|2
Sorry Cavs fans but this series is over. Lebron deserves a better team. JR Smith is mediocre and Kevin Love is only good for getting double doubles. |Rockets|3
Please tell me your being sarcastic. This is the 2nd best team Lebron has had in the finals, very close to the best team he has had in the Finals. Please see this article ["Cavs are better this year"](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/lebron-and-the-rest-of-the-cavs-are-better-this-year/). The Talent is there, it is scheme and gameplan. \n\nAlso, the WCF showed us a series isn\'t over until its over. \n\n***EDIT: I was pulling this from memory, apparently this team is the 3rd  best of the 7 teams. The Top 3 teams are MUCH better than the bottom 3.***|Lakers|6
2nd best team, he has had 3 teams. 2007 Cavs, Heat and now the 2015-2016 Cavs. Doesn't matter what rank this team is in his history, they suck. They have given up and choked. I would believe that the series isn't over but the Cavs play terrible defense leaving many guys open under the rim. Then they shoot horrible and miss wide open 3 point shots. I think they were better when Lebron tried to carry than having their whole team.|Rockets|0
[Go take a peak at the article, its interesting.](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/lebron-and-the-rest-of-the-cavs-are-better-this-year/)\n\nWhen referring to *"teams"* like this ***each year is treated as a different team.*** So, while both the 2011 team (Best team he took to the Finals) and the 2014 team (5th talented)  are the Heat we treat them as different teams.\n\nWhich makes sense, the rosters change every year, and a guy who was an All-Star one year may fall off and the quality of the team suffers.\n\nThis is valuation based solely on the quality of the supporting cast and not Lebron\'s contributions.\n\nHis teammates this year are almost as good as as they were in the 11 & 12 Finals.\n\nThe numbers pass the eye test as well, for instance last year\'s squad is almost as bad as the team he dragged with him in 07, and his Heat team\'s fell in 13 when he was at his best then cratered in 14.|Lakers|1

As a Thunder fan...fuck....life\n\n\n||3
Interesting... Having watched thus far, how do you think it would stand after two games?|Raptors|2
I think if OKC made the finals cavs would match up better but OKC would still squeeze a win out in 6 or 7|Lakers|1
Would you have said that before seeing games 1 and 2?|Raptors|1
Yeah I had whoever coming out of the west winning the series. I probably would have said OKC in 7 before seeing the Cavs in their current state right now|Lakers|3
Honestly, the worst part is...OKC outplayed the Warriors in almost every aspect of a basketball game besides the 3 point line. Game 5 was a tough one at Oakland where the Warriors stars played worse than OKC stars but just got that littleeeee bit extra help from their role players and bench. Game fucking 6....lmfao what a god damn joke. "Coach Kerr, how the fuck do we win this game???" "IDK JUST KEEP SHOOTING 3s IDGAF" "k" -klay thompason goes ahead and sets an NBA record with 11 3s. Like...how hard are you fucking with me. He didn\'t tie the record with 9, or beat it by 1 with 10....nah, he scored 33 points solely off 3s. This was the thunders year and I said it going into the playoffs. They got robbed by a talented 3 point shooting team.||2
Yeah game 6 will probably haunt KD and Westbrook for their entire career. Yeah Klay went off but the turnovers at the end were really the nail in the coffin.|Lakers|3
:(((((((((((( and you could tell in game 7 they felt like they had won the series but who could blame em. They were just lookin around and looking for excuses and never put their best foot forward that game. ||1

Fuck Draymond Green and no. Why would we? Seeing LeBron lose again confirms that he only makes the Finals because East makes me feel good inside. |Lakers|-1
Lol, all right then.||1
I really don't even see any Green hate, more people were mad at the NBA'S handling of some of those plays than Green himself, after all of that how can you be mad at a guy for continuing to play the way he does when there are no reprocussions? He has no reason to change anything|Wizards|5
He is undeniably a key to the series, if he was suspended even if for one match, it could swing momentum completely to the cavs side, that's why I mentioned it.||0
Meh it's not his fault the nba chooses ratings over integrity. |Raptors|0
Wat u gon do rite? Such is life.||-1
Serious question for the Cavs fans. Are you guys OK with LeBron just admitting defeat and not playing the 4th at all? No argument or desire to come back in the game? |Warriors|2
Not a Cavs fan but what was he supposed to do? The only other player even trying was Jefferson. LeBron isn't going to win against this Warriors roster by himself|Wizards|1
I'm not OK with the way the team played, except defensively for the first quarter and a half. I mean realistically we weren't gonna come back. |Cavaliers|1
I understand that but doesn't that send a message. We're talking about a top 5 player of all time. Do you think Bird Jordan or Magic would have just accepted that? \n\nThis is one of those times where perception is a lot stronger than what actually happens. |Warriors|2
Great win for the boys. No matter what happens from here out, I will always be a Warriors fan!||3
Eastern conference really does suck, cavs walk to the final without so much working for it then get annihilated once they face a western conference team. |[GSW] Klay Thompson|1
hahahaha|Supersonics|1
Great narrative.||1
Guise. Guise!!!! LeBron just needs more help|Pistons|3
Well yes.  He does?  Just because the people that are supposed to be helping (and talented enough to do so in most cases) aren't doesn't make him suddenly able to carry a team over the Warriors by himself?||6
Lebron currently is on the team with the highest salary in the nba and on top of this the thunder just took the warriors to 7 games|Minneapolis Lakers|3
Still doesn\'t change the fact that his "help" has gone to hide for this series. This team looks nothing like what we saw the first 10 games of the playoffs. Granted it was against lesser comp but they all just look lost right now. ||2
Lebron has help don't be ridiculous. He left the heat after getting beaten by the spurs and created this roster. It's not good enough right now, he's not good enough right now. The series isn't over yet. Basically they're the WB frog who talks in private and rib-bits in public. Lol eastern conference...|Minneapolis Lakers|1
Yes he has names of players on the team but he does not have help. His "help" isn\'t helping and they may be hurting him they are playing so bad. I think the moment may just be too large for the two guys who are "helping" and have never been in a finals. ||1
Are they helping?||2
They are losing as a team. Championships are not easy to win and there's always a million different excuses for losing them.|Minneapolis Lakers|3
That in no way suggests that LeBron doesn\'t need help.  He needs help.  He needs to help.  Helping is part of "winning as a team".   You can see the Warriors doing it for example.  And they aren\'t even getting paid that much!  Crazy.  So tell me again why LeBron doesn\'t need help from his teammates?||2
Saying lebron isn't getting help is a really shallow way of describing this ass destruction. Lebron is supposed to be an all time great, its on him to pull his teammates together. The fact that you don't hold him accountable just shows that you don't expect much from him.  |Minneapolis Lakers|3
Jerry West was an all time great, as was Oscar Robinson.  You know what they needed?  Help.  As did guys like Michael Jordan and Larry Bird, Shaw, Kobe.  There's a whole list of them, you'd probably recognize a few names.    Though this is the first I've mentioned, his place in history seems to be what you are hung up on.  Its not my concern.  In this case his highly paid teammates played notably worse than he.  Which leads any sane person to the conclusion that it would probably be easier to beat a team that won 73 games if more than one person would play at a high level.\n||0
Lebron for the past 6 years has had 2 all stars lol. Bron has to lead the way, what happened tonight won't cut it. If you're one of the goats create openings for your teammates it's your job to get them at a high level. **The thunder just took them to seven this is for CLE**  |Minneapolis Lakers|3
No it isn\'t?  Seriously.  You are just at the point where your disdain for LeBron has made you delusional.  You are exhibiting zero understanding of basketball history, the game itself and simple phrases and words like "help".  It\'s a pretty good bet you know better but have decided you\'d rather look foolish so you can hating LeBron for your own petty, self important reasons.||0

A sweep is a distinct possibility at this point.\n\nIt is LeBron and Richard Jefferson. Richard fucking Jefferson. Not a single other player looks like they want to be playing in these finals. Its pathetic really. Irving, Love, and JR should all be embarrassed. Unless they have some epiphany before the next game we are so screwed.\n\nIt is legitimately painful to watch. We COULD turn it around but holy hell is it an uphill climb after these showings.\n|Cavaliers|2

I have no clue as to why Lue won't play Mozgov. He's disruptive on defense and can pull Bogut away from the rim. How hard is that to understand? Did they not watch film from last year?|Cavaliers|2
You really gotta start trying everything if you're Lue right now. Honestly,  I might consider starting Mosgov and bringing TT off the bench. And if Kyrie is going to keep getting destroyed on defense and only shoot 33%, you might have to start cutting his minutes for Delly who could at least play average defense out there.|Bulls|1
Delly is playing awful. They already restricted his mins, putting him in at 1min a qt lol..\n\nif anything, they need offense right now. |Spurs|2
I just don't think anything this embarrassing would have happened to Michael Jordan, even early career not progressing past the Celtics or Pistons Michael Jordan. |Bullets|2

This is why KD needs to come to the East.  |Raptors|2
The standard we hold LeBron to is just insane.\n\nLiterally the best regular season team in NBA history that has broken the math of the NBA is beating them, and the main storylines are LeBron and his teammates aren't getting it done.\n\nAnd this is before they've played a game on their own homecourt|Heat|2
I could understand this, if the previous opponent OKC didn't go up 3-1 on the Warriors. The Cavs don't even belong on the same court. |Lakers|3
Durant and Westbrook together are both 27 year old Top 5 NBA players that play two ways.\n\nThat's like pairing 2011 LeBron with Kawhi Leonard right now and giving them OKC's supporting cast.\n\nYou can't beat them in Oracle with much less than that|Heat|2
OKC won game one after being down by 13 in the first half. The Cavs just arent good enough, and they're playing terrible basketball. |Lakers|2
How did Cavs even make pass the east?\nI hardly watch east games but didnt they make 27+ 3's or something?|Spurs|1
The Cavs we are seeing in these finals is not the same Cavs we saw in the rest of the playoffs, their players seemed to have stopped trying. Even if they were putting in maximum effort I don't think they can beat this Warriors team, but without it they are being slaughtered|Wizards|1
Maybe warriors are that good?\n\nAll i know is JR picked a wrong time to not do anything..|Spurs|2
Warriors are definitely that good|Wizards|2
At nearly every position, cavs are worse than OKC except for if you wanna put lebron at 2 or 4 |Hawks|2
Youre talking about a team that had 3 #1 picks and then the number one player in the world join them. It shouldve been cleveland breaking records not the warriors. Thats why they are getting shat on lol|Heat|11

I don't remember who it was at ESPN, maybe Mike and Mike who called it cavs in 6... the east is a dumpster fire. The top 4 teams in the West would be champs over the east ||2
Can't wait for them to tell me how this is only the third time they've predicted a team to win in the finals era only for the opposite team to win the first two games at home. Can you guess the other two? |Pistons|1
That's an interesting hot take but I still think the cavs would have taken it over okc with the home court advantage |Knicks|3
It was. Both Mikes called Cleveland in 6.|Clippers|3
What on earth was their reasoning?|Warriors|2
I don't remember really. I think they made their prediction after game 7 against OKC and tried to play up that they just haven't looked good or as good as they did in the regular season. \n\n|Clippers|1
The warriors, spurs, and thunder all deserve a title at this point. They might as well played for life or death. The cavs just breezed through subpar teams and then beat a decent raptors team. Beating the Hawks in 4 is no feat. Trust me, I'm an Atlanta sports fan.||2
That's what really kills me. The Cavs couldn't have asked for an easier run into the finals this year. Their players couldn't have been any more rested. Where is the fight? Where is the will to win? \n\nThe collective mental state of Cleveland is just sad to watch.|Hawks|2
Maybe as time passes I'm becoming more delusional but I honestly think the Cavs still have a shot. Yeah warriors wiped the floor with the Cavs in game 2 but Cavs were within 3 with 1 min left in 1st quarter of game 1 while shooting 35%. The Cavs also had two shitty games on the road against the raptors where they looked just as bad as they did today. They found a way to fix their offense. \n\n Maybe they can regain their mojo at home (where they've been dominant) and carry that into a potential game 5. To think that the Cavs continue to shoot 35% and for the warriors to shoot 54% is mind boggling. \n\nAs they say a series doesn't start till the road team wins. There are barely any positive takeaways from the first two games though which is not a good sign. Cavs are outmatched at almost every position. I think the home crowd will be a big enough factor to help the Cavs rally to 2-2\n\nWhen GSW was down 3-1 everybody was saying that OKC was their kryptonite due its length/athleticism and that warriors were playing iso basketbal. The Cavs are being shit on in the same fashion. Yes they don't matchup well with GSW but if they can play the style of ball that got them to achieve record offense performances they will have a damn good shot to at least be competitive. There's still some hope to right the ship. Go Cavs|Cavaliers|1
Way to stick with your team.|NBA|1
You honestly do. OKC fans were feeling the same way after G1 of the series with the Spurs.  There's at least 100% more basketball to be played.|Pistons|1
You've lost 2 straight games for a combine 40 over points and you think the home crowd can help make up the difference to tie the series at 2-2. Not to mention losing to the Warriors for the 6(7th?) game in a row, you probably have more faith in your team than the players probably have in themselves. |Suns|2
Cavs gotta put the past behind them and take it one game at a time. The crowd will give them energy/confidence and hopefully the Cavs will start sharing the ball and shooting better. we have not seen the Cavs play their style of basketball. They're gonna have to shoot above their season averages to win this series. Not likely but anything is possible.\n\nMost likely scenario is that the warriors defense continues to stifle the Cavs defense and we get swept but there is still an incredibly slim chance that the Cavs go back to playing their amazing playoff basketball leading up to the finals and make this is a competitive series. Also players like JR and kyrie have been completely choking under the spotlight so that's gotta change too|Cavaliers|1
Warriors were the best road team this year.||3
Obviously dude. They went 73-9|Cavaliers|1
I feel really bad for LeBron.|Heat|0
Why? He basically manufactured the team he is on|Raptors|12
I feel bad for his poor decision making, like leaving Miami, getting Blatt fired, thinking Love was Bosh etc.\n\nBetter?|Heat|8
I wonder what he and the Cavs will do this off season. They can't possibly come back with the same team.|Raptors|3
They are so far above the cap that there isnt much they can do. What teams would take on Love and TT contracts?|Heat|2
Their options are extremely limited. They are stuck with two of the worst contracts in the NBA in Thompson and Shumpert. And trading Love or Irving is just too risky. \n\nMeanwhile lebron will opt out again and demand that the front office improve the team or else he'll threaten to leave again. Basically the cavs will just continue to coast to the finals again and again and lose. The Warriors aren't going anywhere and the Spurs will still be better than them as well.\n\nTheres basically nothing the cavs can do except hope lebron leads the current core that they have to a title. |Bulls|3

Let's take a moment to realize that the way people here are writing off the Cavs is the same way people were writing off Toronto when the Cavs dominated them for the first two games last round.\n\nGranted, they still lost... but still, they were able to tie the series at home. All I'm saying is don't count out the Cavs just yet.\n\n|[LAL] Kobe Bryant|1

He can play with Curry....in Sacramento. |Wizards|2
another 3 day break for game 3?|Spurs|1
I feel like those turnovers on lebron are misleading. Do they count  towards Lebron if he passes to kyrie who then fumbles it (which he did 2 or 3 times) and JR who dropped one outbounds as well.||1
They do and I think the line of thinking is that if the pass were good, it wouldn't happen|Knicks|1
The Cavaliers bench showed up tonight.  They score 30 points.  Very respectable.|Warriors|1
How much of that came in Garbage time though?|Lakers|2
I mean that was pretty much the 2nd half.||1
Quite a bit  :)|Warriors|1
The point differentials in this postseason must be historically high |Spurs|1
So who's everyone's pick for Finals MVP?|[GSW] Draymond Green|1
For me its a tie between Green and Iggy. |Lakers|1
The Cavs actually played solid defense in the Finals last year right? ||1
Yeah they at least tried last year|Wizards|1
I mean, with Kyrie and Love out, it was a lot of players who didn't get much playing time stepping up. They just looked like they cared more and didn't want to let their team now.\n\nNot like this year...||3

Post Game Presser\nhttp://www.nba.com/live2/\n\nLue, Curry, Klay, Dray & Lebron will speak|[MIA] Harold Miner|1
Not a Cavaliers fan (Warriors fan). But what are your impression of Tyronne Lue's job so far? I'm not here to flame, I just want an honest perspective from a Cavaliers fan on what they thought about David Blatt's firing and now Lue's job so far this season. Obviously I don't watch much of Cavs game, but when Tyronne Lue said that they won't be adjusting much but to try and up the pace after game 1, I knew the Cavs would be in for a bad night.\n\nI understand that his defensive scheme was to shut down the splash bros, but it doesn't really work when the splash bros are on the bench or aren't the ones hitting the buckets. You have green wide open 90% of the game making jumpers and everyone attacking and slashing.\n\nThe offensive game plan has been lackluster and pathetic. JR Smith is a no show (which isn't directly the Coach's fault) and Kyrie has been dead weight. I absolutely hate watching the Cavaliers dribble up the court nonchalantly and then do an iso with Lebron for another 10s, enough time for help to come even on a switch when Klay or Curry is on Lebron.\n\nI know it's not always that easy. But a lot of this has to be placed on the coach. I don't care how good your roster is, it doesn't work when you can't make adjustments. Look at Kerr vs Donovan in Western Finals. That was a true showing of coaching match up.|Warriors Bandwagon|1
Trying to play faster was a huge mistake. It negates some of the advantage TT and (Theoretically) Mosgov provide. It worked because, lets face it, anything would have worked vs the East. CLE purports to be a "Balanced" team so theoretically they should be able to adjust. They can\'t, and that\'s entirely on Lue.||2
Why isn't JR shooting as much?\nSub JR in for Fry3?|Wizards|1
Every Warrior starter in the + for a win...   Every opposing team starter in - in a loss.... Never seen that before. Ever |Warriors|1
Didn't that just happen in a gsw blowout nor that kong ago?|[LAL] Kobe Bryant|1
The Cav\'s are secretly kinda happy Love might be out for game 3 right?\n\nAlso, Lue shouldn\'t be throwing that subliminal shade on Love. *"He seemed fine to me at halftime, but he was obviously woozy in the 3rd."*|Lakers|1
The one thing Cleveland had going for them tonight was Shumpert's magnificent hair.|Bulls|1
[lebron - postgame interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIpbYyR0OOI)|76ers|1
A lot of people said the WCF would be the Finals and though it wasn't SAS/GSW but OKC/GSW it was still one hell of a series. Hell, SAS/OKC was several times better than this. Curry and Thompson have had average games to start the series and their still beating the Cavs' ass.|Wizards|1

Hey can anyone link me the total series stats? I can't seem to find them.|Warriors Bandwagon|1
Let's do not rush to conclusion. Nobody should have forgotten the first two playoff games GSW played in OKC. At that moment most of the people concluded that Warriors would be eliminated in 5 or 6 without doubt.||1
Wow|Raptors|1
first iggy then steph \nhttps://pbs.twimg.com/media/CkPBqVWUkAA-8jg.jpg||1
Did the Cavs run more up-tempo? Lue said that would be the key to winning game 2 but I didn't see the game. |[LAL] Magic Johnson|1
Yeah seemed to be running a little more up tempo in an attempt to catch up with everyone on the Warriors literally running circles around them on both ends. Other than that, no. ||1
If they did, no one saw it.||1
The term "defeat" doesn\'t do it justice.|Bulls|1
Draymond Green winning Finals MVP doe.|[SAS] Tim Duncan|1
Lebron in his post game interview looked so nervous. I think game 3, if the cavs start off slow, this will actually become a sweep. |[GSW] Stephen Curry|1
Ouch Cleveland.||1
guess the most interesting part of this series now is who's gonna get finals mvp.|Bulls|1
If Dray gets it, this sub might lose its collective shit.|Hawks|1
i hope its klay|Warriors|2
You should never overreact when the home team wins the first two but I don't think it's an overreaction to say Cleveland has no chance if their bench keeps getting outplayed this bad. Even if the GS bench cools off I just don't see enough talent/depth on Cleveland's side to compete.|Clippers|1
The Cavs haven't scored 100 against the Warriors since game 1...of the 2015 Finals. |Lakers|2

We talkin' sweep or what?||1
I couldn't watch the game, could someone fill me in what's with all the Tyrone Lue jokes? Is it anything in particular or is it just the fact that they fit blown out. |[CLE] LeBron James|1
He basically stood there the entire game, not sure what to do. He isn't playing Frye, who's the reason they beat Toronto one game. He just seems completely overwhelmed.|Lakers|2
Thanks! Did he play Mozgov only after Love's injury or was he part of the game plan? Were they playing with Lebron at the 4?|[CLE] LeBron James|2
He played Mozgov and TT when they were down 20 and needed offense.  What was his hope?  To offensive rebound the Dubs to death? |Warriors|2
Frye didn't have a very good game imo.|[GSW] Baron Davis|3
Well he  played 4 minutes so it's not like he could do much.|Lakers|1
wasn't he getting torched on defense?|[GSW] Baron Davis|1
A good defensive team like the Warriors can easily expose Frye. |Magic|1

I know, what is he, like 47 years old now haha. ||1

So depressing to see them play like this. They're just getting absolutely schooled and I thought this may be the year. Hopefully returning to Cleveland will light a fire under their asses.|Cavaliers|1
Hope is a great great thing.||1
wait, so the strategy of Cavs in game two is to left Draymond Green open for uncontested shots because Green missed it in Game 1?\n\n\nwhat's next, they will leave Klay and Steph open next time?||1
Well steph and klay haven't been hitting shots all that well, sounds legit.|Wizards|1
https://m.soundcloud.com/mac-bari/mac-bari-fuck-lebron-james||1
Anyone have news on Kevin Love?||1
Man, it sucks to watch a finals in which one team is just flat out played on every level.  If you'd have told me that the Cavs would have been embarrassed in the first two games, I'd have said you were crazy.  It appears that the Warriors passed through the fire of a very good defense in OKC and now the mediocre defense of the Cavs is easy to overcome.  \n\nOn a side note, how did the idiot refs miss the foul to Loves head like that? Come on man, it was plain as day and nearly knocked him the fuck out.  Probably gave him a concussion.  But missed the foul? Come on man!|Pacers|1
I've said it a billion times all ready, NBA basketball is just too hard to ref. The game and players are too fast too big to see everything. I don't think you could tell he got elbowed IN REAL TIME, you need slow motion. |Magic|2
I agree. If anything though, play should have been stopped once the referee realized Kevin stayed down. The following basket shouldn't have counted.\n||0
I can see why they didn't stop play though. How often do you see guys flop and pretend to be hurt, I bet it's more often then guys truly being hurt. |Magic|3
You're right. This is a pretty big problem. I think Love being under the basket, along with Green's clumsy ass with the ball, should have warranted a stop in play.||0
I can\'t get out of my head how Brian Windhorst framed the series; he said something along the lines of "This is an entirely different Cavliers team from last year, they have a healthy Kyrie and Love, Channing Frye   is a new addition as well."......hows that Channing Frye thing working out for ya?||1
Windhorst is close to the whole Lebron phenomenon and does a lot of good reporting. But like most traditional beat reporters (who just came up in the news room and were assigned a sport by their editor), he doesn't really understand the game. \n\nOutside of a Zach Lowe or Amin El Hassen (I know he's not loved here), I don't take any of these national guys' opinions very seriously. ||1
I remember telling people before the series, Frye is one of the easiest played in the league to defend. Got down voted to hell for that. |Magic|2

Oh im not on any bandwagon. In fact your team eliminated mine in the 2nd round. Which I was glad to see get eliminated in the ECF. ||1
At least we warmed them up :/|[OKC] Steven Adams|1
If by warmed up you mean lulled them into a false sense of security, then absolutely!|NBA|1
I remember watching the last game LeBron with Cleveland in finals before he left for the HEAT. It literally look like he gave up and stopped playing. He could of easily played at his top and won yet he didn't want to while his team played their ass off(As much as they could). Now here he is playing his little old heart out and his team is sleeping. This is karma.|Cavaliers|1
Has anyone checked on Cleveland? They certainly don't have much going for them, so I'm a little worried.|Raptors|1
indians are in first place (for the moment)...so there always that|Cavaliers|3

Draymond for FMVP?|[NYK] Rasheed Wallace|1
It's not over yet. Anything can happen. For instance Vince Mcmahon takes over for Adam Silver mid finals and puts Roman Reigns on the Cavs. Instant Finals win. |Lakers|1

Like I said the other night, Steve Kerr has the easiest coaching job in sports. Nothing against him but you can't coach shooting percentages.||-1
I am pretty sure that is the point of running plays and imparting "philosophies."|Warriors|8
That's what I meant, you can coach a guy to be in position but when your team makes nearly twice as many shots per attempt as the other team, you aren't coaching anymore.||-2

Not that it would make a difference since the cavs are way outmatched but it does kind of bother me the amount the warriors can get away with on the no calls for physical play. It's like they have a different rule book. I saw green run from the 3 pt line to the FT line on a moving screen against kyrie at one point, but again it wouldn't change anything. \n\nSeries is over though. I hope lebron pulls a miracle and proves me wrong, but it's over. |Knicks|1
They have let both teams play the first 2 games. If you haven't noticed the no calls on the cavs you are blind.||2
I'm more talking these whole playoffs with the green antics and more recently Barnes' elbow to loves head as inadvertent as it was. |Knicks|2
You may have a point full playoffs. Green should have missed a game.||2
Stick a fork in this one, this series is done folks.   The mismatches are too much to overcome, Lebron is a shell of his old self and Love, Irving, Smith are literally decoys on offense and holes on defense.  The Cavs needed 20+ in each game from their three stars and to only get half that or even a third of that is not gonna cut it.   Sad because this may very well be the last time Lebron has enough juice to get them to the finals.   The Warriors aren't going away anytime soon; sure they might have guys get poached in FA this offseason but their core is still on contract and they have atleat 2+ more trips to the finals after this.   Lebron's only chance to get Cleveland that title was last year.  RIP Cavs|[CLE] LeBron James|1
LeBron as a "shell of himself" is still probably what, at worst the 3rd best player in the league in a close race?||4
still tho, he's not the same lebron on those Heat teams. The lebron from 2011-2014 was easily the best player in the league, and could carry his team to the finals trophy. not this year tho. pretty sad. i truly hate the warriors||1
Truly hate them or no but they are a historically good team which probably has a bit of an advantage over a historically good player (especially on his decline).  ||1
In an alternate universe, Klay never got hot in game 6 and the Cavs are now 2-0 against OKC|Warriors Bandwagon|1
Naw they'd still be 0-2|Warriors|5
it can both be true if we live in a multiverse|Warriors Bandwagon|1
Very true...that's the beauty of a multiverse |Warriors|1

All shitty /r/nba posting aside, we know from watching the Warriors come back from 1-3 (the last two losses being blowouts) that series aren't over until you win 4 games.\n\nAre there glimmers of hope for the Cavs? Things they can clearly do better to exploit GSW? Is GSW playing out of their minds (the way OKC was) and they'll come back down to earth at some point?|Lakers|1
GSW won 73 games tho. This is how they play. ||3
I know--I've been watching them all year, but I'm trying to spark some discussion instead of meme posting nonsense.|Lakers|3
I hope Love is okay. I remember when it happened to Klay last year, you kinda step back and look at the bigger picture.|Warriors|1

at least last year's cavs had that injury excuse. what are poor cavs fans going to whine about this time?\n\nthey need to get rid of Kevin love. he's too soft. they can only risk playing him 20 mins because he's a liability.||1
Maybe time to bench Kyrie and Love and try the mozgod and Delly combo again||1
Delly offense is terrible|Spurs|3
Shit if he at least takes shots it will already be an improvement. |Wizards|1
2-9 today.|Spurs|1
Took as many attempts in 1 game as JR Smith has taken in 2, thats not good|Wizards|1
JR got locked down or he is gun shy?\n\nEither way he picked a bad time.|Spurs|1
He is also injured I believe |Trail Blazers|1
Lob or floater, thats about it. |Heat|1

They lost by 33. Not sure if any one players makes up that difference. Still the cavs need to be trying everything at this point.||2
Look.  I love Mozzy Bear more than anyone should but in context of his career what he did last year was most certainly the exception and not the rule.\n\nAnd I love him anyways.||3

I almost feel like LeBron never really had to fight to be on the best team in any league he was in. College may have been a great learning experience for him. In HS being a big fish is a lot easier than in college. I'm not sure he knows how to play when his supremacy is not enough to beat the other team on his own almost. Playing in a bigger pond before the NBA may have taught him lessons that would have allowed him to understand when to push and when to pull.  \nThat *us against the world* mentality is powerful in sports. He's always been so far above the competition he's never developed that. At the pinnacle in team sports, being the best individual player in the league is not enough. It's not a game of individuals. If you can't make the people around you play to their capability, beating the best will be a challenge.  \n||0
I'm not sure you understand what you are talking about. The Cavs are getting outplayed at every position. To put that all on LeBron makes no sense at all. That's a coaching problem 100%.\n\nAlso, when LeBron entered the league  the NBA wasn't like it is today. To say college would have done anything for him is a bit silly. Unfortunately the meta is changing in the NBA and it favors perimeter shooters which LeBron was never known for.\n\nFYI... this is coming from a Cavs fan who doesn't care for LeBron. I'm a rare breed, I know. ||2
If he's the player he believes he is, he should be making more of a difference. I don't think he controls the game very well. I don't think he knows when to dominate and when to get the team involved. I think he is an alpha male with serious issues with other alpha males. I think if he wins a championship and does not get the MVP for the finals, he feels underappreciated. I think he is more of a businessman than a basketball player and it hurts his teams. And when you can dictate who coaches and who gets fired, who the coach is, is at least partially your fault.  \nI think he is one of the greatest individual talents the NBA has had since I started watching b-ball in the late 70's. I also think individual talents have regularly been left without championships. It's why I was never an Iverson fan. An amazing player, but never able to figure out how to make his teams great.||1
I agree, he should be making more of a difference. I honestly feel though that his "star" time in the NBA is drawing to a close quicker than he thinks. I personally believe he wants to win just like everyone else but he has nothing to prove anymore since he already has his two rings.\n\nGoing back to the Cavs, there are tons of problems that extend further than LeBron. With Kyrie, JR, Love it is feast or famine. LeBron can do his job and put in 40-50% of the teams points but if the other 3 are having an off night we look like a high school basketball team. We had this problem during the season but it looks like the whole team has a concussion after game 1. They all have these blank looks on their faces.\n\nOn top of that, we have Love and TT watching GSW go up for rebounds. I know the matchup is against them but they need to put forth the effort. I honestly feel Love\'s injury, although it was accidental, could have been avoided if he actually tried to make plays under the basket. When you stand there watching the ball you put yourself at risk when people are going up for the ball. That is not a place to stand at all! lol. I think we will see more time from Mosgov in game 3 and 4.\n\nKyrie needs to pass. I know he is a point guard but passing out to get open for the shot you want is better than forcing up a well guarded shot just because your role is point guard. \n\nMy biggest problem with this series (I was literally shaking the table at the bar last night) is it looked like the Cavs and coach Lue didnt learn anything from game 1. We suffered from the same issues of trying to play ISO and switching off to double up on Curry or Thompson just to leave Green or anyone else for that matter wide open. Add that to the fact we cant make easy baskets and thats why its 2-0 GSW on top of the fact GSW are playing extremely well as a unit.\n\nNot directing this at you but just a general comment.... GSW is a lot better than they were last year. I get a bit annoyed at the GSW fans trying to say the Cavs have a healthy team now and we are getting demolished trying to justify their win last season. GSW deserved that win... they outplayed us and no matter the lineup you cant play the "well what if we had XYZ" card. I think the way GS is playing this year they would make last years GS team look just like the Cavs do now. I dont think you can say the two GS teams are the same even though not much has changed in the lineup. ||1
I feel for you. I can only imagine how rough it must be going through this again. So much hope riding on this. Winning a title is so galvanizing for a state and is so incredible to be part of. Unfortunately, the other team's fans lose all the air they have in their sails. I was hesitant to say this because of the rivalry, but I'm in Detroit and a Piston fan. For the most part, like baseball, the strike lost me as a fan. I've slowly got more attentive this year because watching MSU's Draymond blossom has been a fun ride. I'd really like to see Cleveland win the title. Hopefully with the Browns or when LeBron leaves again. ;-)||1
I feel like the first ten years in the NBA could have taught him that. He knows team ball, that's how the heat played. Honestly his team mates just aren't stepping up as they should.||2
I think he's always dictated how the game is played. He realized he could not do it alone after Cleveland V1.0. When he helped get the big 3 together in Miami, they expected to dominate the league and surpass the Bulls record. When that didn't happen. he took another path with the young star in Cleveland and playing with Love. Did he think he could force his will in Cleveland more? Did his crew have more control in Cleveland? If you think you're the smartest and best guy on a team and irreplaceable, how can you be coached?  \nI talk about stuff like this with my wife all the time. I majored in Psychology for 3+ years and how we think is interesting to me. If you've always been so good at something and everyone raves about your talent, where does humbleness come from? Where does the drive to improve come from?  \nLike the incredibly beautiful girl, the LeBron/Tiger type talent, the musical or intellectual genius, etc. all they've ever known is fawning. The others have an advantage LeBron doesn't have, there is no one between them and success. In a team sport, it's the sum of the team. Wondering if the team is the problem is valid. I look at someone like Rory or Spieth and see their climb to the top. The drive it takes to get there. The motivations they have to get to there. The effort they put in to get there. But once you achieve the **Top**, what then? What continues to drive you? Fighting to maintain the top is completely different. ||1

I've watched the NBA for going on 30 years. I've seen some all time greats, but I've never seen a TEAM as good, top to bottom, as the Warriors. I think this is the best team of all time. ||0

Cavs win next 4 LeBron celebrates and licks on the tears of every one, cries in press conference, leaves Cleveland, joins the suns, suns also get curry and Durant, suns proceed to be the best team ever... yeah..\n\nEdit: people don't understand sarcasm.||-6

Should've been a flagrant on Barnes, also someone tried to literally blame Draymond in a highlight post straight up lying with who hit Love|Lakers|-3
Classic r/nba overreacting to 2 games. Everyone ITT already talking about how the series is over and how bad Kyrie and Love are, when 3 series ago they were praising them for how great they were destroying the Pistons, Hawks, and Raptors. Let's not forget Warriors pretty much destroyed OKC the first 2 games (first game they letdown after the first half leading 15 and threw the game away making poor decisions), and OKC came back to beat them twice at home. This series is not over until Warriors take 1 home game from them and until then, it's too early to talk shit.||-6
It's definitely not too early to talk shit. But I agree, this series isn't over. Raps came back from down 0-2 to even up their series and the Warriors came back from 1-3 to win theirs. |Wizards|2
Good call.|NBA|2

After decades of being mostly garbage? Yeah, shitty for us fans to enjoy this. |Wizards|14
That was brutal. Refs favored GS in the first half, but wow. Looking forward to Cleveland going beast mode in Game 3.|Pacers|-12
My thoughts on this game\n\nCavs - good for a quarter\n\nLebron - played fine, just a couple slip ups, fixable\n\nGolden State - impressive how they can get guys to step up like Draymond did, other than that played good all around\n\nRefs - absolutely horrible worst ive ever seen|Cavaliers|-7
No mention of a flagrant one for harrison barnes after elbow to Loves head? Incidental or not NBA has given out flagrant fouls for much less. Don't agree with the rule but at least enforce it||-9
Absolutely fantastic product, NBA. Very exciting. Parity at its finest.|Trail Blazers|-1

What took so long?|Warriors|-1
So we're all coming to the foregone conclusion that this series is over? Just like most of us did after the Warriors got blown out twice in row last series, right?|Bucks|-1
Missed most of the game for Game of Thrones. Was Curry crucial to this beat down enough for him to be viewed as a worthy finals MVP who just doesn't have that impressive stats because he's not having to play that many minutes, or this looking like another year for a role player?\n\n(Without an answer for this question, my guess is Curry will get Finals MVP as a season achievement award unless one role player stands out as particularly important to this series like Andre was last time).|Bulls|-1
Nope he was invisible. I think it's safe to say unless he drops 50 in each of the next two games, he will not be Finals MVP.|Heat|0
Curry did better than last game but he is not going to get Finals MVP. Draymond did phenomenal today. |Warriors|2
It'll be Draymond and /r/nba will collectively lose its mind. |Warriors|4
Curry played 25 minutes due to foul trouble and blowout.|Wizards|3
The NBA is  fucking boring when a team is this dominant. I know it's great in a history sense, but I just can't get into it when there is no contention in a game. The Warriors are unbelievably dominant, but it's boring as piss to watch. The WCF was the Finals is far as I'm concerned. |Rockets|-1
We were not dominant against OKC|Warriors|2
Yeah I know. Which is why I wrote the last sentence in my comment. |Rockets|1
Holy shit. My mom came into my room to bring me a plate of chicken nuggets and I literally screamed at her and hit the plate of chicken nuggets out of her hand. She started yelling and swearing at me and I slammed the door on her. I'm so distressed right now I don't know what to do. I didn't mean to do that to my mom but I'm literally in shock from the results tonight. I feel like I'm going to explode. Why the fucking fuck are they losing? This can't be happening. I'm having a fucking breakdown. I don't want to believe the world is so corrupt. I want a future to believe in. I want Labron to win a title for The Land. I cannot fucking deal with this right now. It wasn't supposed to be like this, I thought they were supposed to steal one in the Oracle???? This is so fucked.|Spurs|-19

This is actually a joke, it's originally from what somebody said about Bernie Sanders losing in a primary. |Warriors|1

Nothing more gross than actually wearing those bandwagon flairs|Knicks|-6
Can someone explain to me why this sub has such a strong hatred for the Cavs/LeBron? I don't get it.|Cavaliers|-8
LeBron haters really have no good reasons to why he is bad. If you are a fan of basketball you cannot deny that LeBron is top 3 all time. Probably as good as MJ although they play differently. He has never had a Phil Jackson or popovich coach. |Rockets|-10
Yeah, it really makes no sense to me. You seriously can't make an argument that LeBron isn't a good player, yet people act like he's overrated.|Cavaliers|1
After this series I don't think he is as good as MJ. (assuming we win)\n\nI don't think he's far behind at all and it's close but I still think MJ is better. |Warriors|2
Top 3 all time? Lmao ok buddy.lebron is an empty stat padder who went 2/7 in the finals. .|Warriors|3
You can only blame him for the lose against the mavericks. All other loses were not his fault. MJ was fortunate to have Phil jackson, Rodman, and pippen. MJ couldn't get into the finals until he got his super team. But that doesn't matter. LeBron is breaking all time records at this age. |Rockets|1
As a basketball fan I can appreciate his game on the court. As a person I think he is a lying front running egomaniac. \n\nAs a fan of a rebuilding team and a team that had to trade it's superstar. I hate how lucky the Cavs were in their rebuild. How many number ones did they luck into. How often do you get a superstar deal like they got with Love. Good thing he hasn't played like one since the trade though. Lol|Magic|7

In retrospect, does anyone else think Raptors would have given Warriors a harder time?  Warriors barely beat Toronto in the regular season.|[TOR] Eric Montross|-3
The Warriors would destroy you in 4.  Kyrie and Derozan would be shut down even worse than they looked against the Cavs.|Warriors|1
/r/nba would blow up with the trash bros vs splash bros comparison|Warriors|1
Depends. If the Toronto players literally just showed up and actually tried, which is what every Cavs player not named Lebron or Jefferson has not done, then I would say they would do better.\n\nI honestly feel like we aren't getting what we expected, I wish the Cavs guys would put some effort into this series. I don't think they would win the series still but damn, at least make the games a little more interesting|Wizards|2

I really, really wanted the Warriors to lose this so that small children cried, but oh well.  Two good takeaways:\n\n-Warriors will not have the best winning percentage including postseason.\n\n-LeMeme James loses another final which is always modestly funny.||-10
