When LeBron sits the Cavs offense has to do better than a Kyrie fadeaway, they're getting taken to school by Livingston and Co.
This is what happens when you literally design a team around yourself
and even when the opponents best scorers had an off night, this wan't the finals we were promised
3 points game with Bron, Iguodala's big three and then like blowout
They wanted him to finish the game off strong not expecting their bench to completely get blown out before he could get back on.
Lebron still logged 41 minutes and he was getting worked by Iggy on D. He was probably gassed 
wut?
It was a 3 point game with 30 seconds left in the 3rd. Lebron sits out literally until 10 minutes in the 4th quarter (only 2.5 minutes) and it becomes a 14 point blowout with a bunch of momentum for the Warriors.
Exactly that hit in the nuts was the turning point all the bench had to do was keep up and not let momentum build. As soon as lebron checked back in he probably was going to start doing the 4th quarter lebron thing where he just keeps going to the rim building a lead, cavs loosen up and start hitting shots.\n\nComing back in down 10 or whatever was not what he had in mind and he had to play cautiously to keep it close but the cavs as a whole couldn't execute because they locked up. 
They don't have a system. No offense  without LeBron
None taken
Proper response
They ran  two plays that didn't involve Lebron tonight.\n\n1. Kyrie fade-away\n\n2. Love in the post missing a lay-up\n\nNot really seeing how this is an improvement from Blatt.
He looks lost out there, honestly. 
Lue had never coached a team in his life. Blatt was a rookie to the NBA not coaching, he'd been coaching and won titles elsewhere. 
/r/nba has flipped the script completely. 
Eh I mean I always saw comments in the threads about Lue reminding everyone that Blatt got the team to the finals last year and seemed to coach well with the depleted roster. I think people did a good job of reserving judgment until post-Finals. 
I mean, Tyronn sounds confident in press conferences so he must be a tactical coach.
Hes there for the boys in the locker rooms and to take the blame. We all know Lebron is the coach
spolstra survived, and went on to prove he's actually a pretty decent coach.
LeBron played himself with that Blatt firing. 
They need Anthony Bennet back
They need Dion Waiters back\n\nFTFY
Nah Dion's actually not half bad
Zach Lowe was right. Holy hell are the Cavs prone to backdoor cuts.
THIS. 8-10 from Livingston and 5-5 from Barb? not to mention Bogut 5-7? These are the guys you let shoot so curry doesn't shoot. Doubt itll happen again.
Livingston will hit the elbow jumper all series of the cavs let him. Those Bogut hooks and Barbose floaters are fools gold tho
Doubt the splash brothers will score 20 points total for a game again.
as long as Kyrie keeps dribbling that's a safe bet
actually i'll take you up on that bet
They were straight up missing consecutive wide open looks. It was insane. I felt so uncomfortable with even that original 14 point lead because they just weren't on. But the bench just completely outplayed the Cavs as a whole today which was amazing to watch. 
Delly jumping kin front of Livingston is not a contested shot
So, like, the Warriors in the regular season?
I'm way more surprised by Barbosa than Livingston. SDot is amazing from mid range, and he has the size to shoot over the guards defending him. 
Lol come up with another excuse man. Lue had no other options, the dubs just have a better bench. And starters. 
Livingston just feasts on small guards. And it's not like Cavs guards are capable of generating much defense. I'm not at all surprised Livingston went off (didn't he have a huge game on Christmas vs the Cavs?) - but 100% surprised Curry and Klay didn't.
Seriously. While Steph and Klay usually play much better, I'm not surprised at all at how well Livingston played. He's a fucking stud, and would drop 20 ppg if he played 30+ mpg.
he also said in regards to last year's Finals\n   \n>The Cavs do have other options who are tough on defense such as Iman Shumpert and Tristan Thompson, but that\xe2\x80\x99s besides the point. The point is that most of the outside world views the losses of players like Irving and Love as problematic, while those in the know do not. 
I've always said this. Cavs cannot win with Love on the floor, and Dellavedova played his heart out last year to make up for Kyrie being out.
The fuck is wrong with Love anyway? Dude looks lost. What happened to the player from Minnesota?
He was the best option on a terrible team, but he was still the #1 option, so he got the ball a ton. Now he has to make the most of fewer opportunities.\n\nThere was a post on here a few months ago about how almost all of his scoring & playmaking in Minnesota came from the top of the arc & the elbows, not the corners. Cleveland puts him in the corners a lot because Kyrie & LeBron occupy the elbow & center court. That's not comfortable for him.\n\nThe league has also changed since his prime days in Minnesota. Post scoring is basically useless unless you are hyper-efficient/dominant and Kevin Love is more of a scrapper down low, which is not as useful as a skill as it used to be. Cleveland also doesn't want him clogging the paint as a post-up big.\n\nFinally, he's never been healthy, so it's not far-fetched to think that one of his injuries was a bad one that hampered his athleticism or confidence.
The Warriors are also just better. imo.
to be fair, when this team is clicking, i think they are one of the best teams in history
>to be fair, they are the best team in history
That's an objective statement. 
That's probably why he included the imo part
Kyrie is used to people cheating on him.
Unlucked and cucked.

Another guy posted a picture of Kyrie's girlfriend in his bed on instagram. Kyrie later reveals that they were not dating when that picture was posted.

Is he the most successful person ever to be named Dwayne?
one of my favorite things about wwe Smackdown! Bring the pain for PS2 is that when Rock would do the peoples elbow he'd throw out one elbow pad each time he did it in a match. And when he did it three times he would get this confused look then do it anyway.
Man, the people's elbow is comedy.
That shit was a meta-move, right? 
It was legit performed initially to make Undertaker break kayfabe, as a joke. 
IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT YOU THINK
Haven't seen the people's elbow in years. I was always so hyped to see it as a kid. 
Its the most electrifying move in sports entertainment history!
:( Poor bastard

Kyrie just caught the blessings. 
Guess Lebron didn't carry enough this game....
Isn't that Cousins?  I swear the little chin tuft looks like him.
It is, it's way too talk to be LeBron anyways
Curry and Klay shoot the ball like shit. \n\nCleveland's Big 3 combines for 66 points. \n\nGS wins easily. \n\n*Exactly* how I imagined this game going. 
I wasn't saying it was absurd at all, just a bit unexpected. \n\nIf I'd told you that those things were going to happen before the game, would you have guessed that GS would win by 15? Highly unlikely..
Just wanna say, [I called it](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/4lx8oy/lebron_klay_thompson_and_steph_curry_probably_the/d3r9hbt):\n\n>The series will come down to whether Barnes/Iguodala can punish Kyrie, and if Draymond can hit his open 3's. The Cavaliers will live with those things happening. Curry and Klay will struggle. Warriors in 7.\n\nBarnes punished Kyrie early, Iguodala did work, and Draymond hit some open 3's. Curry and Klay will struggle.\n\nI think Cleveland will bounce back big next game, and up the physicality. They're not used to playing a Western conference team. They'll be back with a vengeance. Warriors in 7.
Cavs in 4
66 Isn't going to cut it for their big 3 in this series. They're going to need to be closer to 75
Not to mention the fact that kyrie & love shot horribly. I know lebron was 9-21 but like 4 of his misses were just tips that went off the rim. \n\nPretty much, kyrie needs to shoot around 50 percent & lebron probably needs to get 20-25 *shots*, not 21 shots with 4 or so being missed tips. \n\nAlso, it wouldn't hurt for a guy like JR or Channing Frye to step up in game 2 either.. \n\nEdit: Not saying these things would guarantee the cavs a win, just might help, especially when curry & klay have a *regular* shooting night. 
with the way their bench plays theyre going to need more than that
Are you judging their bench purely off this game? If not, you should know it's a good bench. 
They have a good bench, the Warriors have a great bench
i thought Frye was a big part of their bench but he only played 19 mins? \n\nThe other 3 are Delly (worse than Livingston), Jefferson (worse than Iggy), and Shumpert (exact opposite of Barbosa). \n\nI don't see how that bench can really make that big of a dent against a deep team like the W's
Tyronn Lue no longer undefeated against Steve Kerr

Don't give these people any ideas
This picture always cracks me up so much
The crowd wasn't really in it either. Weird atmosphere at Oracle tonight. Or maybe I'm just used to Game 5 and 7 of Oracle last series. 
Nah, it definitely seemed really quiet, at least on TV
Yeah idk about that. According to the beat reporters the crowd was so loud the cavs couldn't communicate about the shot clock running down leading to the violations.
different crowd nowadays. have you seen the ticket prices? You don't get as many die hard as you do VIP schmoozers
Bunch of tech bandwagon nerds. Damn shame die hard, bay fans can't afford tickets
$893 for two seats in 209 row 23 is a steal though! /s
Different crowd from last week? That gentrification really sneaks up on you!
The pricing of finals tickets vs conference finals can weed out a lot more "regular" fans. We\'ll probably see the same thing in Cleveland. 
Idk I thought they were pretty loud.  ESPN might mic the crowd differently than TNT
ehh...I've kinda felt this way for the past year. Def not as crazy as 07 'baron-town'
Well that tends to happen when the cheapest tickets are $500. 
I went to the finals last year and it was louder than usual imo
Cheapest tickets were $350 today\n\nCheck the Cleveland prices, it will be the same\n\nPeople are dumb if they think Oracle has quieted down after game 5 and 7 of last series. Shit was loud af 
Everyone commenting doesn't know what the fuck they are talking about. National TV mics always mute the crowd. I paid 350 for my ticket a few hours before the game and the crowd was deafening. Fuck all these people that say the real fans are being priced out. Mother fucker I've been a fan for 25 years and it's the fucking finals. 350 for a finals ticket is a fucking steal. It's not like I got some incredible deal. I'm so sick of this narrative. I make 18 bucks an hour and live in SF, the most expensive city in the country. Guess what? I was at that game screaming my head off with plenty of real fans. \n\nSorry, I'm drunk but I'm sick of all these idiots saying the real fans can't afford the games. 18/hr in SF is damn near minimum wage. If I can go to game one of the finals, so can a lot of real fans. 
They got an A+ today lol

Lmao. The bench really won them the game.
Cavs made superstars out of 34 year old Barbosa, 32 year old Iggy.
Their bench looked like a team from Kuroko no basket.
it's pretty great if you can suspend disbelief when it comes to the physically possible fairly regularly. once you get used to everyone having their specific superpower, it's a really fun watch.
Midorima best generation of miracles player, fight me if you disagree
Man... Cavs had their best shot tonight. How do you get blown out with both splash brothers playing like shit?
Iggy, Shaun, and Barbosa played extremely well. Draymond had some big plays as well. 
Draymond played twice as well tonight as basically any OKC game
Livingston is OP from midrange
white Kobe
Seriously, nerf in next patch please NBA
He has sliders like in 2K. His midrange is at 99% and his 3 point is at 0%
Though, in 2K you can set "No Injuries".
Is it even possible to get an injury as bad as his in 2k?
No, it's too unrealistic. 
;(
Meh. I though Westbrook shot them out of it. 
Really appreciating how well Thunder played after watching this game.
I wish we could see a thunder cavs match up. Not saying GSW is going to win against the cavs just would have been some cool match ups with the thunder and the cavs
Honestly I feel like the GSW-OKC series was the true finals of the season. Although I'm not positive of how this one will turn out, there is no way it will be as good of a competition as the western conference finals. What a hell of a series that was
Omg yes. I live overseas so i almost exclusively watched warriors games this year and didnt catch many cavs games. 3 minutes into this game I just shook my head thinking how OKC is so much better on off and def compared to the cavs.
I didn't realize how well Roberson & Adams were on the boards. Going from those two to Love & JR made life so much easier. 
Adams is insane at grabbing boards. I was terrified every time the ball went up last series
Yeah dude, Adams is terrifying.
That series against the thunder really made the dubs a hell of a lot better. Holy shit. 
This is actually what I expected. They had a tough series against OKC so GSW have the urgency, pressure,.and experience to compete in the finals. CLE breezed through the post season and now will have to fight for their lives. 
You're welcome
Seriously. It's like night and day how less tense it is around the rim. 
If I told you Shaun Livingston lead the Warriors in points for game 1 you would have thought something went horrible wrong for them.

True story
Which is why this is such a bad loss for the Cavs. Both Steph and Klay weren't that hot and they still pull out the win easily.\n\nedit: I just feel like the Cavs should have been able to steal this one. They had way more points at the free throw line, I understand they didn't get anything from JR and maybe if they did it would be a much different story but in the final minutes they couldn't even make it close. 
Not really, the Splash Bros weren't hot but pretty much everyone else was. That's even harder to defend tbh and probably won't be the case next game.
What if the splash bros are hot and everyone else is hot too
Lol
he hasn't made an excuse yet
That's a situation CLE obviously needs to avoid but we're forgetting that Thompsons foul trouble mixed with some solid defense on Steph is what led to the dubs bench having the opportunity to go off. Cavs picked their poison and it backfired, largely because 90% of their roster was sleepwalking. 
>weren't that hot\n\nOne might even say they were the opposite of hot. That's why I love this team though, because it's an actual team and isn't solely reliant on one player. 
Weren't that hot?! A bit of an understatement.
20 points combined has a to be a season low for when they both play 30+ minutes
29 was the lowest they had scored the entire season
It's a season low period
Probably a low, even when Curry was injured and not playing lol.
That's TWICE in the playoffs now that a nut shot has been the turning point in the game. \n\nEDIT: 25-8 run post nut-shot. 
ONE PUUUUUUNCH!!!
i thought kerr's clipboard shatter was going to do it. little did i know, the golden fist had not yet risen.
Shaun Livingston = 20 pts.\n\nSteph + Klay = 20 pts.\n\nShaun Livingston = Steph + Klay.
Username checks out 
Steph Klayvingston.  
The Splash Only Child
I see you overloaded the operator
Can't argue with that logic! 
Shaun Livingston: length? \xe2\x9c\x94 athleticism? \xe2\x9c\x94 3 pt shot? \xe2\x9d\x8c great passer? \xe2\x9c\x94\n\nConclusion: he gud
He's made 12 three pointers..\n\nEdit: He even shot 67% from downtown in his run with the bucks.\n
Everytime I watch the warriors I'm always looking for Shaun Livingston to take an eventual 3 pointer but nope he just steps in swishes a mid range every time. 
It\'s kind of crazy how quickly the way players approach the game has changed. I guess I have been spoiled by mid range jumpers by Paul pierce, kobe, dirk, etc, but it\'s almost become an "old man\'s shot". 
**SHAUN LIVINGSTON FOR FMVP**
He doesn't match up well against OKC. 
yep, the only team where he doesn't have the luxury of being ten inches longer than everybody else
Mama, there goes that man.
#GOLDEN STATE LIVINGSTON
Livingston was on fire, but Iggy is already showing he deserves it again.
what would actually be an awesome story, the dude was on the brink of not being able to play basketball ever again. 
they thought they were going to have to amputate his leg. isn't that even crazier? i'm so happy to see him having this moment.
dude was on the brink of getting his leg chopped off.
I really hope people know that you're not kidding. They almost had to amputate his leg after that injury. 
I mean his knee was pretty much just not there anymore. There was no structure to it. He tore every ligament and I think the cap was shattered. It's a miracle they saved his leg, let alone that he can walk, run, or play professional basketball.
Or carry Klay and Steph's limp bodies on his back through game 1.
I don't think any player in the NBA's success brings me more joy, it's so great to see him doing this well 
Just a good dude, too.
Yes at one point they were supposed to cut his leg off
Yeah, really a fan of him. Great that he does so well after that nasty injury
I honestly thought he was done after that. Bouncing around the d-league and various teams that never went anywhere after the regular season. Kerr and Myers found gold with these role players.
One of the worst injuries I've ever seen. He's been absolutely balling since his stint with the Nets 
:/
I just watched it a minute ago, Breen is always calling it out every time Livingston is playing well.  It doesn't under-deliver, that's for sure. uggh.
**Kevin Love has never lost a play off game in Cleveland!!!**
Just wait
Kevin Love is undefeated in 49/50 states in the playoffs
Soon to be: Kevin Love has never lost a playoff game on a Wednesday.
Soon it will be "Kevin Love has never lost a game at the YMCA."
I can see it now: "Kevin Love has never lost a game that he\'s won"
Big if true.
Sorry.
O shit waddup!
Plus-Sized if Precise
Where is "big if true" from?
I don't think it's from anywhere specific. It's a very general thing that sports journalists say to sensationalize rumors, so it's become a running joke here 
I don't care how often this is used, still cracks me up.
Big if true
Warriors have so much firepower it's not fair man. It really shows how well OKC defended them until they let it slip away....
If OKC was even a little bit mentally stronger they could have taken that series. They lead a ton in those games. Only when GS would pull ahead by like 5-10 points they would absolutely cave.
Game 1 tho
Honestly Irving was the very glaring weak link tonight. Love was pretty good, had a couple lapses but held up way better than expected. A looooot of the Warriors easy buckets came off bad decisions by Kyrie 
Those last 6 words is the perfect description of OKC's season
Dude Warriors set like 4 or 5 different 3 pt. shooting records in that series and through the first 4 games Westbrook was shooting better than Curry and Thompson from 3. Warriors literally shot themselves to the win and OKC regressed to the mean. I wish people would stop saying they 'gave it away'. 
They had like 15 blown leads in the regular season. Chokelahoma really showed this year. 
All i can remember is that Golden State game. That Curry half court shot was insane
Probably my favorite play of the season. It just encapsulated everything about this season. But especially those 2 teams.
This is so sad but true.
If we could just stop talking about this right about now, that'd be *grreeaat*
http://i.imgur.com/ENogMVo.gifv
irregardless is not a word. You either have regard or you don't. You don't not have not regard.
I teared up watching this, never seen a person so defeated
That's funny as fuck lol
I can't thank you enough for this.
this was from last year
this was from the future
I've seen this replay a million times but I never noticed how sad LBJ looked until now
Did I just feel bad for Lebron?...
the split second of blissful acceptance at the end is what makes it
I always thought his face at the end was, "My fucking team didn\'t shout out to let me know fucking Curry was there? Sounds about right..."
How could you miss that? It's the best part!
LeBron goes through the 5 stages of grief in a second 
This was the perfect chance for the Cavs to steal game 1. Curry and Klay had a bad shooting night and the Cavs big three was scored 66. All they needed was a decent performance from their bench. \n\nAnnnnnd despite paying so much of the luxury tax to bring in seasoned vets, the Golden State bench roasted the Cavs bench. 
The Cavs shot twice as many free throws, the Warriors only hit 9-27 on 3s, and Steph and Klay only combined for 20 points and Cleveland still got blown out. Wow. 
They roasted the starters 
Surprisingly the Cavs 1-on-1 defense was fine in this game, Kevin Love and Tristan Thompson fared perfectly fine on switches. Where the absolutely massive defensive errors came were in the aspect of communication (the lack thereof or confusion) concerning defensive scheme. This was especially in regards to off ball and transition defense. Pick and roll defense was passable and helped them contain the GSW back court, however off-ball, the Cavs overreacted too much to their threat. Curry cutting back door ? His man and the guy in the paint switch on to him leaving Draymond/Barnes open. This happened time after time all game. The Cavs also resorted to stand around iso ball as opposed to moving the ball around, the lack of off ball cuts made me go insane. It\xe2\x80\x99s Golden State\xe2\x80\x99s off ball movement that constantly gets them good shots, opponent defenders have a hard time keeping man and ball in front of them so will always be a step behind. Seamless switching like OKC did is extremely rare and is something that after watching this game the Cavs are not capable of. I understand Lue going to Love early in 2Q to make as much use of Curry being out of the game but it threw their entire rotation out of whack and they didn't get Frye into the game or play that bench lineup that was so great. Lebron was incredibly passive in the 2nd half kicking out of nearly every drive or passing it to Kyrie and then standing and letting him iso. He needs to be moving much more on offense to put pressure on the Warriors defense. After letting the warriors bench get hot in the first half they smoked the Cavs to start the 4Q and blew the game open. Predictably Curry and Klay hit threes later in 4Q to stave off any comback. Cleveland either has to be much better offensively or defensively because besides the work they put in on Curry and Klay, their defense was utter trash and the offense wasn\xe2\x80\x99t much better. If they don\xe2\x80\x99t make adjustments, they are losing this quite handily. While they stayed close through 3Q that kind of performance will lead to a 15 pt lead for the Warriors next time.\n\nAlso a note on refs, they hardly called anything this game for both sides. I think they tried to be as fair as possible, it was just that Cavs were forced to take more contested shots inside (whereas most Warriors shots inside weren\xe2\x80\x99t contested as much if at all) so it felt like the weren\xe2\x80\x99t giving them the benefit of the doubt. 
Yes: TL;DR: the Warriors beat the snot out of the Cavs with their bench because the Cav's defense was focused on Steph and Klay.
You might have a good point in there somewhere, but you wrote it in a painfully large block. You might want to reformat.
The cavs offense is iso ball. Still don't understand why lue gets credit for doing nothing different from blatt
Nice writeup
You really thought the switches demonstrated by CLE were passable? I felt like the Warriors got a ton of looks off the PnR and great open shots from bad communication on screens...honestly from my perspective OKC played so well against GSW because they made them work so hard for their shots -- I didn't see CLE do the same tonight. \n\nEdit: agree, nice write up. 
Golden states bench is fuckin stacked though. Livingston looked like MJ out there. 
Aberration nights happen. Golden State's bench is not going to be that dominant every game. Cleveland's bench needs to step the fuck up though.\n\nedit: something like 12 different people have replied to point out Steph and Klay won't play that badly. I figured that went without saying.
Idk man, the bench wasn't hitting crazy shots. Those Livingston and Iguodala shots are going to be there for the taking all series. 
Steph and Klay won't be that bad tho
you know what else won't happen every game? steph and klay both shooting like shit.
Then again, Curry and Thompson are probably not going to be that bad every game.
This was literally their worst combined performance in the entire season. Some of it can be chalked up to the Cav's defense, but they missed a lot of shots that they usually make.
A lot of both outliers is the Cavs blanketing Steph and ~~Curry~~ Klay (I'm a moron) on defense. 
>Steph and curry 
Steph and Curry\n\nI believe it\'s spelled Stephen Curry!
FAIR POINT
there is no aberration about shaun hitting those 2s though. that's his thing.
8-10 though
That's because Cleveland is sending J.R., Kyrie, and Dellie at him.
Yeah, he did it when Curry was out too. Was really efficient with that mid-range jumper. Struggled last series cause of OKC's length, but he has a great match up this series. I doubt he'll have 20 point performances, but he's pretty reliable with that shot
That's his bread and butter yeah, but the dude couldnt miss tonight
if you give him that turnaround or midrange jumper you can expect high efficiency from him though. I don't know what else to say other than you guys haven't watched enough warrior ball this season.
yep.. anytime he gets that hang time, he locks in and drains them. It blows my mind.
Three things in life are certain. Death, taxes and Shaun Livingstone hitting midrange jumpers.
specifically turnaround midrange jumpers. Dude must've been a huge MJ fan in the 90s
Tbf, there's no one on the Cavs that have the length to stop him from shooting those 15 footers. I guess Thompson or LeBron could, but you can't commit those kinds of assets to fucking Shaun Livingston. 
I dont think Livingston is going to play like MJ every game tho
And Steph and Klay aren't going to play like warm doo doo every game, so...
He's so sexy though.
I'm pretty sure Kyrie physically cannot block him and Livingston knows it. Ultimate confidence with that in mind, and big change from OKC
Yeah I mean the length and athleticism was really in all their heads. 
Yeah that one he made right before Lue called the timeout (I think this put them up 10), You can see Kyrie's arm fully extended and Livingston's release is still like 5 inches higher. 
Roberson and KD are a nightmare to Shoot over. Even Broadie with his insane vertical could contest those...
Its all about that wingspan
Also, Dion knew how to dig-in and plays decent post D. More than decent, in fact.
Dion is the only guy who I can remember consistently stopping Livingstons post move.
Westbrook gave him a hard time too. They're both really strong and physical, it seemed to disrupt his rhythm.
They forgot to shut down the third Splash Brother...\n\nThe midrange step brother, Shaun Livingston
*splash uncle
There's just so much depth to the GSW bench though... they're like the Rebel Alliance - the tighter the Cavs clench their D, the more shots slip through their fingers.
> clench their D\n\n
The Waluigi of the Splash Brothers
Dudes fucking lenghty enough
speights is wario no question
if we're doing guys who love midrange jumpers its defff speights\n\ndraymond is yoshi - absolutely invaluable in his role as an accessory player
Does that make lebron bowser?
Draymond is Yoshi.
Yoshi?! You mean that soft fuck that Mario would kick into bottomless pits just to save his own Italian ass??? \n\nNah Draymond's fuckin Bowser dude. But like, Mario Kart Bowser who's chill and doesn't fuck Mario's bitch, but who's still a total beast (and villain).
Yoshi's a boss bro. Dude eats anything, throws eggs at anyone, spits fire, flutters in the air, rolls around in eggs, stomps his ass when heavy, and straight up slays.  
A horse can't do half the shit I posted.

repeating my comment from the game thread, but lol at steph's interview - [the espn mic was clearly broken, so they did... this](http://i.imgur.com/kKdlPr2.png)
Lol, I knew something looked off.
Weird because whenever I've see those triangular mic logos you can pull them off and slip them on another mic
ESPN's best and brightest
Best part about that, in the video, you can't even hear what Steph is saying. ESPN decided it was more important to have an ESPN logo next to Steph, than to actually hear what he had to say..
I know the Cavs played like shit but Lue has got to come up with something more than stick love in the corner and iso Lebron and everyone watch and not move. 
You mean coach of the Cleveland Cavaliers Lebron James has to come up with something, right?
[Nice work, ESPN](http://i.imgur.com/D3Tbo87.jpg)
He's just making fun of espn for some graphic guy's fuck up. What narrative are you talking about?
Okay no, I don't think any major sports outlet wants LeBron to win. To be honest everybody has been riding the warriors dick so hard this year. Its justified though I'm not gonna lie, but they want the warriors to win. This was nothing more than a mistake. 
Everyone in this thread is now dumber having read that. And May God have mercy on your soul..\n
That hat looks great on you! Is that... sheet metal? No? \n\nTinfoil you say!?
His point is they reversed the teams in the graphic by accident, the Warriors had the much better bench.
Nice work grabbing the Giants win in that cap!
It was against the Braves. They could field a team of gerbils and still get at least three runs. 
No wonder millions of viewers are cancelling.
Our bench is terrible. FLAMING TRASH. 
missing persons alert issued for JR Smith
I think that hand injury really hurt him
On his shooting hand, that will cause him to not want to shoot.
tis a flesh wound
Played some good D on Klay tho. But definitely needs to do more offensively 
This is underrated, though. I think the hit to Klay's production was worth more than hitting 2-3 more shots. Obviously, if he goes off and has a JR Special with 6-7 3s or something that's worth more.\n\nBut give me average day JR or defensively locked in JR, throwing himself at loose balls and shutting down a scorer of Klay's caliber... I pick today's JR every time. \n\nIf he can maintain that mindset, and pull the trigger a few more times (especially back in Cleveland), he can make a real difference in this series.
Been going on for a while now dude. Its a cold case
Lue showed up to a coaching chess match with Hungry Hungry Hippos
Spoelstra was pretty good
Blatt was as well. led a broken and hobbled Cavs to 2 wins in the finals.
And then Lebron got him fired
https://gfycat.com/WetMeaslyFox
Of all the reasons that the Cavs will likely lose this series, this one might be the most overlooked.
maybe if we try more iso plays..
Game was close until it wasn't. \n\nQuick thoughts:\nWarriors really showed off their depth tonight--that run in the third quarter was huge; the Cavs bench really had no answer for Shaun Livingston. Will be interesting to see how Cleveland adjusts in Game 2.\n\nBiggest part tonight, I felt was the defense on Lebron by Igoudala and Green, specifically Igoudala's ability to strip the ball without fouling which pretty much shut down a good part of the Cav's defense. \n\nAlso: the Cavs got blown out with Thompson and Curry bricking a good portion of their shots--that's definitely not a good sign moving forward.\n\nSuper lopsided game, but we saw with the OKC-Spurs series why it's bad to draw overarching conclusions from the first game. Hopefully the extended time off helps the Cavs figure things out for next game.
I think they prepared by renting a bull and taping a basketball to its horns.  Then they have to practice backpedaling and swiping.  It's almost as dangerous as LeBron driving.
They over helped in the switch with Curry and Klay and that led to some pretty wide open shots from us. Now, if I'm Lue I'm cool with Green taking an open three or lettting Barnes post up on JR. I think both coaches know that Livingston or any other role player isn't going to win us three more games. For the most part I liked how Cleveland defended our two best players. The thing is, if you screw up the switch and that leads to an open layup or dunk then that's what you should adjust.
SHAUN LIVINGSTON 2016 NBA FINALS MVP.\n\nSeriously though, the warriors bench was the x-factor in this one. They outplayed their matchups , and were extremely efficient at the same time.
I think it's crazy the Cavs did such a good job keeping Klay and Steph out of sync but had no plan for the bench. How do you not know know Livingston is going to do the pretty mid-range jumper 9 times of 10? 
Because Livingston doesn't give a fuck if they know or not. He just sinks them even when they know it's coming.
Hard to call Sdot's shots contested. With his hops, height and reach, it isn't really impeding him much. Durant does the same thing with better range.
He's the super poor man's Durant.
You know that was Lue\'s gameplan. \n\n"Shut down Curry and Thompson, and we\'ve won this game. Who\'s going to step up for them? Livingston? Barbosa? HAH!"
When Livingston comes in to hold down the starters and prevent a Cavs comeback.... Today is a good day.
I mean, the bench was the A, B, and C factor.
Iguodala is a fucking defensive savant 
Nah, ball don't lie.
i'm telling you man, it frustrates me when he gets called for a reach-in when he gets all ball. refs should give him the benefit of the doubt when they can't see instead of assuming it's a foul
dat fury swipe
Seriously, +22 when he was on the field, even better than Livingston (+20).\n\nE: sorry, it's court not field, english is not my native language and I'm usually more of a soccer guy, got confused :D
court
It\'s the 50 yard line Dad!
After Kerr broke the clipboard everything went downhill for the Cavs, don't make Kerr angry, you wouldn't like him when he's angry
I did not know that Kerr is Nunu now
KERR'S CLIPBOARD DIED FOR THIS
I think it started with the Iggy nuttap.
He did hit that 3 right after the foul...
That fuck-you 3 immediately after was amazing
And the circle of life is complete.\n
Honestly, I have never seen a player who shot so poorly from 3 in his career have such a turnaround.\n\nHe just seems to make every 3 he gets.
He's always been an average 3 point shooter in terms of percentages. Iggy's more of the streaky type though. 
It must be just be from the high pace of the game, but whenever I see him get a wide open 3 99% of the time he makes it.\n\n
PLEASE see more of his wide open threes
[Meanwhile David Blatt](http://a.fssta.com/content/dam/fsdigital/RSN/Ohio/2014/10/15/10152014-FSO-NBA-DavidBlatt-PI.vresize.1200.675.high.26.jpg)
David Blatt be like, "Coaching is harder than it looks eh Lebron?"
but he was late to meetings!!
How many times did we see Kyrie blow a defensive assignment? I feel bad for him because you can see his passion, but man it just doesn't translate on the defensive end.
Yeah and his 20 second dribbling possessions don't allow for any flow on the offense either 
[Finals Klay picking up where he left off](http://dsz7vodgjx60a.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/17043702/resize-1.png)
You must be new here
Steph and Klay got an A tonight
Man, I've seen this like twice in this thread already. That's glorious.
He did play great defense though. Shows how great the 2 can be even when Theyre not scoring
He single handedly saved the season in game 6 at OKC. \n\nKlay can relax now...the bench will clean up these games. 
Fuck man Klay ruthlessly killed us :(
He did you guys so dirty, that he even pulled up from thirty.
Admit it. You've been waiting to drop that for days
He also kept the Warriors in the game during crucial stretches of game 7. It seemed like every time the Warriors were letting the game slip away, Klay would drop a couple of threes and keep the team in it until his teammates woke the fuck up.
Consistency. 
What if I told you your knee was destroyed and you'd never play again? And what if I told you you also be NBA Finals MVP? ESPN Presents: 30 for 30, Mr Livingston, I Presume.
Watching this Cavs team made me appreciate how good Thunder were on the defensive end.
It blew my mind how good OKC\'s defense was during the playoffs. They looked like by far the best defensive team in the league. Super long, athletic, and generally smart with rotations. Can\'t believe the Warriors edged by them.\n\nZach Lowe said something like, "They don\'t look like they\'re just playing really good defense; they literally look like a completely different team than the one from the regular season."
Tough game, our interior defense was piss poor and we missed way too many shots at the rim. But I think our main problem was that OKC fucking choked and blew a 3-1 series lead. Thanks a fucking lot, OKC
Sorry, didn't realize I wasn't allowed to express an opinion on here. \xf0\x9f\x99\x84 Not saying this series won't be entertaining as well, just think Thunder-OKC would have been more entertaining due to stylistic matchup and skill level being closer.
If we were to talk about regular season, cavs are going to get swept now.
The Cavs do not match up well against OKC.  The Cavs would have had a hard time winning because of the 7 footers and the fact that no one on your team would have been able to cover WestBrick.  The only thing that would be in your favor is the Curse of the Sonics, but the Curse of Cleveland is seemingly of equal strength.
Regular season Thunder =! Playoff Thunder
Also, curse of Lil B.
[Mods...you guys don't get enough love with some of the shitposts you go through](http://imgur.com/gNvuWQc)

The fuck is this son
Lolllllll this is great
I mean that's how they do it in soccer so I wouldn't be surprised if some people were confused
Two games, whoever scores more goes through. If both teams  score the same amount, the team that scored more goals in their away game goes through. If both teams score the same amount of away goals, there's extra time, then there is penalties.
What? no.\n\nScore only matters when the games are splitt.
Right but since this is a series it could get confusing to someone who is used to aggregated scoring. I get why he posted it, probably just comes from a different background.
It kind of sucks. \n\nI remember someone mentioned that people assume that everyone posting here has at least around the same amount of knowledge as them when it comes to basketball and the league. So sometimes honest questions get asked and people think they are trolling. 
At a certain point they need to just google it, we don\'t need a bunch of posts that are yes/no questions.  There\'s no room for discussion in that thread, someone would just say "No the NBA doesn\'t use aggregate" and then we might as well be Yahoo Answers.  The information is out there, we aren\'t really the place for questions like that.
Plus, for a new person I'm sure a comment in a game thread or something would be well received by the community, as opposed to a thread of its own. 
First two sentences from Wikipedia:  \n>The NBA Finals is the championship series of the National Basketball Association played between the Western and Eastern champions of the Conference Finals. **The first team to *win* four games** in the best-of-seven game series is declared the league champion and is awarded the Larry O'Brien Championship Trophy.    \n*Emphasized for clarity*  \n\n\nIf you don't know about some sport the first thing you're going to do is read up on it a bit, not just straight up post to reddit with zero thought on it. 
Yeah this is aggregated series scoring 
That makes much more sense. This poor guy is probably some international fan watching his first nba playoff series. 
Bless America 
Yeah UK fan here and that's clearly the situation.\n\nFor some a reason I will never understand, 'series' in soccer last 2 games. An even number. Which is fucking mental. So we have to aggregate the score from the 2 games to see who wins and also and away goal is weighted against a home goal.\n\nIts the most ridiculous shit.
#Im Just Here To Overreact \n\n...nah, but for real...Cavs need to work on their layups

Goddamn, I fucking love Shaun Livingston.\n\n

He is like the satan of moreyball.\n\nBut damn did he have a good game.
Shaun 'Jordan' Livingston
How could you not 
I've always wanted Livingston to just go out and kill it, despite the injury, the doubters, etc, and tonight was fucking amazing
Spawn Killingston.
Lebron has the most help he has ever had
I almost feel bad for Lebron and Cleveland. He did the (IMO) honorable thing, went back, and tried to win one for the hometown. Yet it's the same problem as before: They've failed to put a championship caliber team around him. I can't imagine how frustrating it must be to be a top 5 player in the world and be stuck with teammates who are clearly inferior compared with the team you're trying to beat. 
He didn\'t go back cuz it was the "honorable" thing to do. He went back because he saw an opportunity to play with a younger duo in love and Irving. The hometown angle is the positive spin he put on it so he wouldn\'t get shit on again. Dudes calculated about everything.
It's not going to happen.
82-0 season incoming? 
The Heatles wouldn't beat this GSW team neither
Why is this down voted? Its damn true.
They would've done better that the Cavs imo. But yeah.
Yeah, I never bought that.  He won nine more games in 2013, and no one would pick Love over Bosh or Irving over Wade.  People just like overreacting.  "Oh, they only lost two games in the playoffs?  Best Lebron team everrrrrr..."
He played defense, people usually don't remember that. 
In hindsight yes. I do remeber people were adamant that Bosh wasn't even a max player, Wade was finished. Remember the 'its not a big 3, but big 2'. I believe it was NBA on TNT analyst and HOFer Shaquille O'Neal who said that. 
Except for those seasons that he and 2 other future HoFers dad dicked the whole league
2012 and 2013 heat teams were pretty stacked
And they were good too!

It's like the GSW went into the Hyperbolic Time Chamber training with the Thunder and came out Super Saiyan-level for the finals. 
With steph and klay still gathering up energy for the spirit ball.
I feel that Thunder series made them feel invincible. I mean imagine being one game from elimination then coming back pulling a near reverse sweep. They must be feeling cocky as hell.
Steven Adams would fit in so well with the Ginyu Force.\n\nJust think of the poses.

At least Lebron can give Cam diving lessons.
Delly is happy to help with that.
scrappy guy
Holy hell Cleveland\n\n* I have no idea what Tyronn Lue was doing. Why did Shumpert play 17 minutes and Frye only played 7? How did JR play 36 minutes and only take 3 shots? Where was the offense? *What* was the offense? Seemed like every play was either a missed layup after an ISO possession or a Kyrie fadeaway.\n\n* Too many turnovers at the worst possible time. I feel like LeBron had 3 or 4 turnovers on possessions that would have been layups and they all came right as Cleveland started to make a run and they always ended with GS points at the other end.\n\n* Tristain Thompson got paid 82 mil??????\n\n* Where is the heart for the Cavaliers? This can't really be backed up with stats but when they went on that great run and took the lead, they didn't really capitalize on it. I mean the Warriors immediately went on a 25-4 run or whatever and Cleveland's starters got nuked from orbit by Golden State's bench. No intensity. Idk. The Cavaliers are a weird team.\n\nOverall I'm just confused as to how Cleveland somehow looked worse tonight than in any game in last year's series. I still think they can win game 2 and maybe steal the series in 6 or 7 but they just did not look prepared.\n\nOne very positive thing that I think might be sustainable for the Cavs is that they played great defense on Curry for most of the game. I doubt he'll only have 11 again but it looks like they made a blueprint to contain him but didn't have a blueprint for literally anything else.
Super surprised by this result.  I had CLE 128, GS 52.  Oh well it was only $10k.
Lebron on that type writer beginning his first draft on why hes going back to Miami
After Tristain Thompson got blocked by Draymond on that dunk attempt, Bron was probably thinking "damn why am I playing with this foo when I could have Whiteside instead"
Nah. He's laying out the groundwork for why Lue *wasn't* the best coaching choice, and what trades/FA signings he wants in the offseason.
So... Cavs in 5?
Bucks in 6
They'd still win four in a row in that case so the guy still has to give us his social security number
SPURS IN 2
cavs in 4 still.
Thunder in 5 
seriously now why I see all cavs fan were cheering for Thunders last series 
If you're implying that the Cavs would have walked all over us, let me remind you we pushed the Warriors further than the Cavs likely will. 
nah not saying Cavs would walk all over you guys, it's just probably better match up

he edited the comment ya dingus
This is why people should add "edit:" messages to their comments... so we know what they changed. -_-
Some people are asking for them, but the hate id get on a curry-Thompson lowlight reel when they won would be unreal. General rule is win=no lowlights 
He's not being brigaded, op is just dead wrong that Steph sucked in the finals last year.\n\nHe average 26/5.2/6.3/1.8 on 58.5% TS. \n\nThose are MVP numbers.
All these flavors...
Wow. Just wow.
did this dude even watch the finals last year?
26 pts, 5.2 reb, 6.3 ast, 1.8 stl = poor game I guess. 
Ehhhh.... I wouldn't do it
There are better lowlights and people are just trying to hate on the Warriors
Lowlights are supposed to be salt in the wound. Those lowlights would be like rubbing salt on a callous.

Well, the meme is supposed to be used ironically, but Klay actually was fine
But like the fire metaphor doesn't make sense given the game didn't end up being super close\n\nMore like a few flames and a bunch of Livingston firefighters 
If you told me before the game that Steph and Klay would combine for 20 points and the Warriors would still win. I would've said you were crazy.
Not just win, win by 15.
If you told me before this season anything that has happened for the Warriors this season. I would have said you were crazy.
That's not what was crazy. What was crazy is that the proved themselves fighting through a west that wasn't hurt, breaking multiple NBA records including the best regular season record of all time. Steph Curry hit over 400 threes shattering his own previous record. I'm sure you didn't imagine all this happening?

If only if Kyrie Irving and Kevin love was healthy.\n\nEDIT: Thanks for the gold <3
The satisfaction when this idiotic excuse can't be used anymore
Don't worry, I'm sure some of you still delusional Cavs fans will always have last years' what if scenario to hang your cap on after you guys lose this series decisively
It\'s not safe yet. "If we had Blatt" excuses are already emerging.
are you cereal? have any links?
Man that argument killed me this whole season! 
Same. People just assume that those two wins the Cavs eked out would have been in the bag, plus having Kyrie and Love would have put the Cavs over. \n\nThis totally ignores that Love and Kyrie were replaced with plus defenders getting more minutes. And because they were out, the Cavs were forced to play slower paced around Lebron--which is a key to negating GSW's transition game. \n\nThat shift in play style and the improvement on defense might not have happened if Kyrie and Love were on the floor.
Which is why every GSW fan openly begged for a healthy rematch. Even if we lost, at least people would stfu about last year.
Cavs were determined to not lose to Curry. And Warriors were determined to not lose to LeBron. One of their supporting cast did their jobs. 
So how big is the difference going to be when Steph and Klay hit their shots? 
Well, GSW's bench might also not be as red hot when that happens. But yeah, I doubt the Splash Bros have that rough a night again
How big is the difference going to be when GS doesnt have 8 players in double figures?
more to do with cavs defence then how they play
Did you see the shots barbosa and Livingston hit? They played good D but those guys were on tonight. I think they come back down to earth game two but the splash bros will also be back to their old selves
Livingston has been hitting those shot all season. Small guards may as well be invisible to him.\n\nBarbosa seems like he usually makes crazy runners and misses open layups.
He shot 80% this season?
a lot of times yes. He'll come in for short spurts and hit 3 of 3 and then go back to the bench. happens a lot.\n\nHe's literally been their momentum shift machine when they've needed it.
I definitely think that Barbosa will come back down to Earth a bit in the next game, but Livingston makes those shots all day long. If Kyrie is defending him on those post ups, it's going to be BBQ chicken for him. 
To be fair, a lot of those shots were contested, barbosa and livingston just weren't missing anything. 
Should balance out enough to not negate a 15 point differential. 
Curry and Klay average 51.9 this postseason, Barbosa and Livingston 12.8. If they go back to average, it balances out to +12.9, so they will be fine I guess.
mmhmm
math.
Are Love and Irving going to become elite defenders in 3 days?\n\n
I said all off season they wouldn't have made a difference because of their defense everyone laughed at me. Series is far from over but I'm confident 
Nah man, Warriors only won a ring last year because of injuries. They could never beat the ~~Thunder~~...I mean ~~Cavaliers~~...I mean 1996-1997 Bulls if those teams were healthy. 
I mean, how is is not obvious?\n\nLeBron goes out and the Warriors bench go on a massive run with Love and Kyrie still in.\n\nThe Thunder were able to effectively switch and trap. The Cavs have shown ALL PLAYOFFS that they couldn\'t without LeBron.\n\nHell, I was watching the Toronto series watching them miss all of those wide open shots against the Cavs thinking "They\'re fucked against the Warriors. Even if Curry and Klay aren\'t on. You can\'t leave Green, Iggy, Barbose, and Livingston open like that"\n\n\n\n
It's almost like the Warriors are much better than every team the Cavs have played
Honestly think Portland would give Cleveland a good series.
Lol stop. Blazers are 2...maybe 3 players deep. 
Ok now that's reaching a bit

http://imgur.com/VUJrPkg\n\nThe Cavs lost against the Warriors' *bench*. They should be very worried.
They got smoked by the Warriors bench.\n\nThat was a normal Warriors bench game. The ought to be really fucking worried.
It's normal that Livingston gets 20 on 8-10, the bench has just 1 turnover, and they shoot 60%?
Pretty much especially facing a porous defense
Livingston, Barbosa, and Iggy combining for 18-24 shooting. Yea..no. That's not normal.
yeah they played well but not like out of their mind. Steph and Klay still played about normal minutes and shot really poorly. That won't happen every night.
The cavs bench combined for a GOATlike 10 points. That's not going to happen again.
real question: you think delly + shumpert + frye + rjeff will combine for 20?

Strength in numbers... \n\n- GSW: 7 players with double figure score.\n\n- Cavs: 4 players with double figure score. 
But HM04 is strength\n\nBut HM07 is waterfall and the Warriors players were wet tonight
Oh snap, that means they are going to evolve at some point.
now do TM
TM04 is Calm Mind.  \nTM07 is Hail.
Apparently not 
Lebron put up 23-12-9 but for those who watched the game you could tell he had a bad game. It's crazy how much pressure he is under
Those are mediocre numbers for Lebron, so much more is expected from him he's that kind of beast 
His efficiency was pretty bad though especially with all of the isos.
In what world is that a bad game? Take away the tips he's shooting 55% with a near triple double. That's a *great* game. This game was won by our bench not lost by LeBron
Who's we? Got a turd in your pocket?
That team just isn't good enough unless lebron goes crazy 
And to think many people consistently say that without Stephen Curry the Warriors would be trash. I think that's what makes this team so good. The bench could honestly be a slightly below average 40 win team. Tack on a back to back mvp, a very good shooter in klay Thompson, and a ton of defensive prowess and you've got a very good team. 
If he played like Curry did they would have lost by 40. 
Props to the refs though, they never really get any love other than getting shit on when they fuck up. They were pretty damn good tonight

I miss the Thunder v Warriors series.
That is the perfect illustration to why lebron counting stats are not very impressive or make a good argument.  \n\nGoes to show how low impact his stats are (that his fans love reciting). High usage, low efficiency, empty stats and a loss to bench squad (!) with plenty of excuses. \n\nIf you can't elevate your team of hand picked superstars to win against another teams bench, it's on you

Nice throwback meme. Remember back in the beginning of the season when that post was mandatory during the streak?
That, and then the "You Warriors are good, REAL good. The Best" meme, followed by the "YOU SEE WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU MESS WITH THE WARRIOR!" meme.
Death, taxes, and Shaun Livingston from mid-range
If we win next game I think we split in Cleveland and close it out at home in 5.  If not this is probably going to 7. 
- Warriors bench killing it, no surprise.\n- Cavs bench apparently doesn't exist, no surprise with that either.\n- LBJ one assist shy of the triple double.\n- Iggy wants that second finals MVP.\n- Irving was kinda trash despite the points.\n- Cavs gave up so many points in the paint.\n- Feels like Love missed ten layups.\n- Livingson with the match-up nightmare.\n- Don't think the Cavs can pull off the constant switching the Thunder did.
Igoudala was so huge this game... the back to back steals on Lebron in the second quarter were unreal.
>no surprise with that either\n\nAnd that's how you can tell someone hasn't watched a lick of the 2016 playoffs
Cavs had it easy in the East. Now they're gonna see some real adversity and they'll be squeezed for the cakewalk they got with ECF.
Your bench has been less than stellar against weak competition 
Forreal dude. Frye is a bad matchup against the warriors and he's the biggest punch of the bench. JR is definitely not gonna repeat this performance too. It's gonna be a tough series 
or he's saying the east competition isnt comparable
Bench is averaging barely over 20 points a game (compared to the Warriors at just under 30) last series. They are an inconsistent group and (like last years playoffs) it isn't surprising they are getting handled during those rotations.\n\nOne great game by Frye doesn't negate the fact that they are usually scraping by to find double figures from someone from the bench.
Still need points, and your bench does not provide that on a consistent basis. \n\nThere is not one single consistent scorer coming off your bench.
Who does Frye guard in this series? 
Barnes will get points like he did tonight.
Yep the X factor Channing Frye would've dominated this game if Lue had played him.
Feel like I'm missing some /s here
which is probably unlikely to continue. Especially against a defense like the warriros.\n\nBut the main reason he didnt play much is because hes too slow to defend against this team
I like Frye, but he would really really struggle to defend against the Warriors 
Not saying he shouldn't get time when you're playing bad, but it's unlikely he'd really succeed. He can't really defend against the Warriors, he's very slow of foot, and he also likely won't continue shooting over 50%. It's pretty hard to keep that up regardless of who you're playing, and the Warriors would make it harder than other teams did 
They didn't get near the uncontested 3s that they did in the east. Frye is useless if he can't get those 
He can't defend against this team 
They were exploiting the shit out of Kyrie on defense.  When they had livingston running point there was a span where they attacked him 3 times or something in a row. He just is a matchup nightmare against that lineup.
That's the problem with Kyrie being healthy, if he's not producing on offense, he becomes a major liability on defense, which Delly never was, and Delly still contributed somewhat on offense with his efficient 3 ball.  
You never see this on the stats either.  Lack of defense can produce a lot of losses, even if there is a lot of offense from the given player (ahem Harden)
Specifically Livingston, there's a 4 inch difference between them, he has no way to contest the midrange jumper
> LBJ one assist shy of a triple double.\n\nAt this point I'm starting to question if he does this intentionally to fuck with us.
JR couldn't have been any more shit if the warriors were paying him to tank in hookers and drugs
Yesterday this was the deepest team Lebron's ever had. Today, Lebron needs help.
Just LBJ problems.
[HI my name is Klay, and I Have DirecTV](http://imgur.com/Ra2tNLH) 
Klayble
the fouled out really makes it
Man the Splash Bros were on fire tonight! Livingston was living around the free throw line and I don't even know if Barbossa missed a shot. Now if Steph and Klay can play better off the bench this team could be unstoppable! 
I know it's a joke but Barbosa literally did not miss a shot.

All we need is **LLLL**ebron!
Every damn game this playoffs the GSW's opponent have a moment of hope before the Warriors just shit all over it.
I'm so salty right now. (And drunk)
When Curry has an off night, Thompson usually will step up and vice versa. The rare night both have off nights, the rest of of the team steps up. This is nothing new.
Gotta give it to the bench, saved us tonight :) can't get away with that next game 
I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to diminish the win by the warriors because they played very well, but I\xe2\x80\x99ll be damned if you can show me two minutes out of the 30+ that JR played where he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t walking. When you see most of the Cavs trying so hard to win and notice JR literally walking on defense and standing completely still on offense it\xe2\x80\x99s infuriating.
That should tell you more about the Cavs and the Eastern Conference.
You just extrapolated JR smith's laziness in one game to 15 teams. Unreal logic.
Well I meant the fact that jr as a key player on the best team in the east can get to the finals as easily as they did tells you about the level of competition. 
Pretty impressive skills.
It tells me you didn't watch them. JR was all hustle and effort the entire playoffs until tonight. 
That should tell you more about JR smith lol
warriors defense made a lot of that happen. they played them hard as fuck on D.
JR walks a fine line between being too high and not high enough. I'm not sure what he was tonight. Regardless, he wasn't the right amount of high.
Nor was Klay, for that matter.
A few thoughts:\n\n1. To lose a game where Curry and Thompson played their worst game of the season is probably fatal to Cleveland.\n\n2. The Cavs will probably shoot better in the restricted area, but the offense is going to continue to be way too dependent on iso scoring if the W's keep switching everything.\n\n3. The Warriors have played absolutely no cards. Traditional lineup, long rotation, etc. It's not like they poured everything into this one.\n\n4. The Cavs now either need to beat a 73 win team 4 out of 5 games, or win a game 7 at Oracle. Good luck with that.\n\nI just don't see it. I feel like analysts are grasping at straws trying to come up with why the Cavs can get back in this series. OKC was better than Cleveland. That was obvious then, and its obvious now.\n\nWarriors in 5. 
God this is gonna suck. I wanna talk shit about Cleveland this series but it's not worth it.  It's such a shitty place to live, making jokes is like stealing candy from an aborted fetus
You could tell the defensive intensity was completely different this series to the WCF, so much space for everyone on the Warriors, whereas the Warriors struggled a lot more against the length and speed of the OKC backcourt. Unless Cavs defense can get to that swarming level, I'm not sure it will be a close series.  
Honestly this was the perfect opportunity to steal game 1 for the Cavs. Especially with the way Thompson and Curry were shooting, and in the third when they kept switching leads the chance to take a lead was there.\n\nWhat a shame, wasted opportunity \n\nCredit to Livingston and Iggy, good game from both those guys
Having a weak east is bad for the nba.
IF THE CAVS WERE HEALTHY THEY SAID 
I wonder what the excuse will be this time...
It was game one guys
Are you unaware we are here to overreact??
Judging by how most Cavs fans reacted after getting blown out during that one regular season game, they'll scapegoat it all on Love
I already heard some ref hunting in the first half
[Warriors bench like](https://imgflip.com/i/157nwj)\n\nWith JR not getting his first points until late in the 4th quarter and ~~Kevin Love basically not showing up tonight~~ (SEE EDIT), along with the Warriors bench putting up 35pts VS the 10pts from the Cavs bench and not to mention Curry and Klay not ~~exactly~~ hot, it\'s going to be tough for the Cavs to get W\'s without some serious adjustments and for their guys to step it up a notch. Warriors bench came through in stellar fashion tonight, absolutely fantastic bench players; the Cavs bench needs to step it up in the next game\n\nAlso I have no clue why so many people are saying, "LOL And this Cavs team is supposed to be better than lasts years" etc etc --\n\nYa\'ll forgetting that this Warriors team is much better than last years Warriors team, it\'s not like they are playing at the exact same level they were last year, this team improved a lot since last year.\n\nCavs still managed to keep it closer than I expected despite everything up until the end there, should still be a great series considering the Thunder lost by, what, 26pts I believe in Game 2**. I am looking forward to Game 2 to see how both teams respond, HYPE!\n\nTL;DR - Warriors bench got that dad dick, Cavs guys need to step the fuck up, JR, Love AND the Cavs bench can\'t ghost in this serious and expect any W\'s\n\nedit: As some of you pointed out, Kevin Love did show up tonight, I was just expecting a little more from him through all 4 quarters, he seemed to dissappear for several minutes at a time when they needed him most and I feel his statline looked better than his play; doesn\'t help that JR forgot he was playing tonight so maybe that made Love feel needed more than he should have especially putting up 17\n\nAlso Warriors bench put up 35 tonight VS  10 from the Cavs bench; they are going to have to step it up aswell
[I had a similar idea...](http://imgur.com/xAlF1be)
idea: 9/10\nexecution: 3/10\nwith rice: 10/10
I thought Love was fine besides a few easy misses. How did he not show up?
Yeah everybody forgets that the Warriors got stage fright during the first few games of the Finals. They ain't nervous anymore. 
Nah, that was just low intensity Steph and Klay.
Nah they just missed shots. Wouldn't pin it down to nervousness. 
Livington's mid-range is on a whole other level...he had a hand in face on nearly all his shots, and he was still lights out. Just an absolutely matchup nightmare for traditional point guards and even against bigger guys like Shumpert or JR. He was really only stifled when LeBron was guarding him, but even that creates mismatches for his teammates (I recall Kyrie having to guard Barnes in a lot of these situations).
Yeah LeBron can slow down pretty much anybody on the Warriors but unfortunately for the Cavs they only have one LeBron. It's a shame he can't be at multiple places at once.
That's pretty unfair to Kevin Love in my opinion
Kevin love not showing up? Did we watch the same game? 
He didn't get a triple double so he's a scrub obviously 
Kevin Love had a great game. The guy has blinders on.
That line confused the shit out of me. It felt like he did whatever he wanted.
Eh he missed some gimmes and wasn't as effective in the post as you would hope but he had a solid game offensively. He's so good on the glass, I feel like his impact there is underrated because a lot of what he does on the boards is subtle unlike a Deandre Jordan or Andre Drummond 
Draymond had the best statline for the Warriors tonight: 2nd in scoring, lead the team in rebounds/assists/steals\n\n
Lue better stay up all night watching game film. That was not championship coaching. Blatt didn't die for this!
Steve Kerr undefeated against clipboards.
[R/NBA at LeBron right now.](http://i.imgur.com/QvnWaaG.gif)
It's okay. Props to GS and their bench. \n\nGreen wasn't a piece of shit. \n\nSad we can't hoist it, but good game. 
not over yet 
Anyone else kinda disappointed that this felt more like a regular season game than a Finals game? A few notables--the Delly nut shot on Iggy/Iggy staredown, Kerr breaking a clip board, the Cavs comeback in the 3rd. But overall it seemed low energy (awful crowd for Oracle) and unremarkable.
The WCF is the series that matters most, the actual Finals is just a formality.
OKC - Warriors game 7 was the real finals game. Oozed that atmosphere.
yes yes yes. I resorted to putting the game in the background. 
I enjoyed the game
Tough call\xe2\x80\xa6 but I still stand by my early prediction that the Cavs would be lucky to get to 6 games. \n\nEdit:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/4lta59/early_predictions_for_warriorscavaliers/d3q0eh8
Warriors in 5
I think the Cavaliers will take maybe 1-2 games in Cleveland, but when you lose by 15 and Curry/Klay COMBINE for 20 points, your odds don't look too great right now.
I mean, their bench went off. No much you can do about that. Wont happen every night. 
Neither will Steph and Klay combine for 20.

Jesus Christ you people overreact, remember when the Thunder got blown out in Game 1 against the Spurs?
Yes, its all apart of the experience!
Nah bro Cavs got healthy Love and Irving. I mean look at the results tonight! Oh. 
we all know cleveland would have won if frye got more minutes
The Golden Bench Warriors. 
At least ABC plays replays of sketchy fouls 
Cavs need to quit worrying about taking advantage of the switches and just play team oriented offenses.  The Warriors know it's coming and just swarm the ball.\n\nCavs also need to make their damn open layups, missed at least 10-15 gimmes tonight.
Warriors are undefeated when Kerr breaks a whiteboard
Every...Fucking...Game..YES YES YES YES YES
This was must-have for Cavs. Big 3 playing well and Thompson/Curry totally off. yet they lost
Barbosa outscored the Cavs bench by himself. 
Lue didn't do a great job managing his rotations at the end. No reason to have LeBron sit and watch as the Warriors rattles of 15 straight. Game was over at that point.\n\nI understand that James needs a breather but sitting him all that time, even after that ~5 minute review stoppage, is baffling to me. 
Much like game 7 of WCF, it was extremely enjoyable to see all the haters losing their shit as the game went on.\n\nI absolutely love it when people let too much salt into their brains and completely lost their minds.
I find it odd that everyone is focusing on the splash bros. bad shooting night.  It was a product of the Cavs throwing 2 or 3 bodies at them (especially steph) at all times leaving everyone else with easy looks all game.  
We forget that Golden State's key bench players were starters at one point in their careers. Insane performance from the bench.
Flops, High Leg Kicks, Attempted ball murders, a near fight, a dive into a fan... this game had it all. \n\nLebron was WAY TOO passive though.
Dellavedova managing to protect his hard earned reputation as the dirtiest player in the sport.
The warriors bench won the game for them, amazing, unselfish play!
I was promised JR would lay the pipe ;(
Not to project a series based on one game, but as someone with no dog in this fight, I will be whole-heartedly rooting for the Warriors and a Shaun Livingston Finals MVP. That dudes been through so much and it would be the perfect feel good story. 
At least they contained Curry and Klay, no?\n\nNo, that won't work. Warriors simply have too many weapons to fire. Cavs' role players had it rough tonight. Hope they can bounce back and make this series competitive before the Splash bros figure out (very soon) how to make a come back.
I love Shaun Livingston
Cavs focused SOO much on Steph and Thompson allowed for the bench guys to get a lot of quality points.\n\nI don't think Lue thought much about how to contain Livingston (and Barbossa), and the Warriors exploited that badly.\n\nAnd the Cavs hadn't seen this good of a defense and weren't quite ready for the intensity.\n\nKyrie is a weird player. Shoots a ton, scores a lot, plays AWFUL defense, and doesn't seem very efficient in any of it.
Holy crap.  Splash Bros combine for just 20 and GS still wins by 15 and controlled pretty much throughout.  This could be over quickly if Cleveland doesn't pull it together, and fast.  Having Kyrie and Love healthy doesn't help a lot when the bench does jack squat.
This flopping bullshit needs to stop its an embarrasment
If every game was called like game 7 of the WCF, there would be no more flopping. 
And the Thunder are like "How come we didn\'t play against THIS Klay and THIS Curry tonight?"\n\nI guarantee you the Thunder would win by 30 if Klay/Steph combine for only 20. They\'d shut everyone else down.\n\nSeriously, it\'s just Livingston. It\'s Barbosa getting his, Bogut getting double figures, Barnes finally woke up.\n\nIf the Cavs can\'t beat the W\'s when the Splash Bros. only get 20, they may not win a game this series.
Cleveland so worried about the Steph they leaving somebody open every play practically.
It's gonna be another tough series for LeBron's back. 
So Shaun Livingston this year's Final's MVP
Cavs tried to play some aggressive defense on Curry which worked but once he passed it out the Cavs didn't communicate on their switches and always led to easy dunks for GSW. \n\nThis makes me appreciate the OKC defense more because they worked as a unit on defense (offense an entire different story) and even though they were scrambling and switching everywhere people found a man and stuck to them.\n\nThat being said, Cavs are going to be lucky if they can even win 2 games in this series if they play like they did tonight. Splash bros played shitty. They gotta try something new like move Kyrie to the bench or just start Lebron at center or SOMETHING because I see the same outcomes for the rest of the series.
Unfortunately for the Cavs, the Warriors without Curry and Klay are still probably good for the 4 seed in the East.
lol, they got their biggest lead when klay and stephen were benched.
Apparently the Warriors without Curry and Klay are good enough to be the 1 seed in the East
We lost to the Warriors bench.
Curry and Thompson play like scrubs but we still win by 15. Go figure.
#\\#FuckDelly
Dellavedova is nicknamed Deli becuase he loves touching meat
https://imgur.com/a/9HQUw
A lot of lazy "The Cavs will adjust" analysis.\n\nThe Cavs are the inferior team and are overmatched. We need to stop pretending these teams were *even* before the series began. Just because you want a good matchup doesn\'t mean it exists.\n\nThe bottom line is Curry and Klay were trash and this game wasn\'t close. Not a good omen. At all. 
If the Cavs can't win a game when Curry and Thompson combine for 20 points, they're fucked
I just came here to overreact.\n\nIS LIVINGSTON A MAX PLAYER?
Funny, because weren\'t Cavs fans original argument "WE WILL HAVE HEALTHY IRVING AND LOVE THIS TIME, CAVS WILL SWEEP" 
Will the Warriors bench play nearly perfect the rest of the series? Probably not.\n\nBut will Steph and Klay play this poorly the rest of the series? Probably not.\n\nCavs need to find an answer to Warriors fast, otherwise this series will be over a lot sooner than they would like.
Might as well replay the WCF instead of this trash
They're talking nonstop dogs at /r/cavaliers
[Dear Cavs](http://i.imgur.com/k9oddcl.png)
Who's AF?
Obviously, Adonal Foyle
A full cavs team would destroy the Warriors...Oh yeah 
LeBron came in and and was an assist shy of a triple double, and all I'm seeing online are people blasting him for not caring.\n\nSteph forgot the game was happening tonight, and all I see is people talking about that late three he had when the Warriors were already up by double figures.
*"Ballhog"*
Curry forgot the game was tonight? Sure, he shot like crap. But he still had 5 board, 6 assists, and was pulling double teams constantly on cuts which is a big reason why Livingston and the rest were getting such great looks. 
stats aren't everything dude. he has the ball 80% of the time, he needs to make more happen. stuffing the stat sheet isn't good enough.
LBJ was not at his best tonight. He played ok, but in order for the cavs to win he needs to play flawlessly. However, he played fantastic defense on Steph when he was matched up with him.
At least he didn't invade vietnam
It's not good enough for him. He was stalling the offense a lot he needs to get it moving more 
Not all on him though, the warriors defense was just that good tonight. They were clogging all the passing lanes and were basically on top of the guys hovering around the 3 pt line. The help defense was always on point and theypretty much contested every shot. The warriors defense was just damn near flawless. 
Cavs fans in shambles. LeBron going to have to break his back carrying these fools lmao
For non Warriors fans, this was a pretty shit game to watch. \n\n\n- It was only close for a brief period of time, then it turned into a blowout. \n- Warriors stars weren't out there shining like they usually do, it was the bench doing the damage on offense\n- Cavs played stagnant offense most of the time and struggled with their shooting\n\n\nAll that equals a pretty boring game really. I want to see the Warriors stars smashing it, in a close game, where there is good basketball being played by both teams.
It was pretty fun for people who never want to see Cleveland win a title...
Really?  I always love watching bench mobs kill it.  It's been one of the more charming aspects of the Spurs the past few seasons.
Good thing Kyrie and Love are healthy this year, what would Cleveland have done without their 14/39 combined shooting tonight?
You know the cavs are in trouble when the Warriors play below average and still blow them out. This isn't like the Thunder series where Klay Thompson and Steph Curry had to go God mode just to barely scrape by a victory.
Are the warriors lucky?
I loved hearing JVG sarcastic comments about "well Curry must be injured since he\'s struggling tonight". Tell it like it is, I will always love JVG commentary.
Curry and Klay have their lowest combined scoring game of the entire season and they win by 15 - Cavs fucked
I felt like, I already saw the Finals this year in OKC vs Warriors.
Hope the Warriors shut out the Cavs. Love seeing Lebron cry.
cavs dont stand a chance do they? curry and thompson have bad games and they still lose handily.
Ya, why even have a 7 game series, we can just predict it from a single game, you want me to e-mail the nba?
Dear Warriors (non bandwagon) fans:\n\n\n\nYou took us to school\n\n\nSincerely,\n\n\nA frustrated CAVS fan
I am glad coach Kerr subbed Curry and Klay in for garbage time
Leboob making it to 6 straight finals is less about him and more about how consistently bad the Eastern Conference is. Bring your sorry ass over to the West and see how many times you even get to the finals.
[remember that time the Cavs were so much better than the Warrirors when they are healthy?](http://d13beo3f7vpmvd.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/stephface2.jpg)
Him drawing double teams, leaving a guy open the entire night sure had nothing to do with it. Just like last Finals, he had nothing to do with it then either. 
They had a week rest.\n\nSteph and Klay played their worst games of the whole season.\n\nWe won by 15.
And curry and klay both won't shoot this bad at the same time again either. 
I can't wait to hear what the excuse is this year
Lebron took his Space Jam acting too far and actually thinks his shooting powers are gone. Method acting gone wrong.
**Lebron** is on the team with the highest salary in the nba
I've been saying, OKC, cause of their length, was the scariest team and toughest matchup the Dubs would face.
Here come the "Lebron needs more help" excuses. Meanwhile, I\'m always told Lebron gave us 2 rings so why can\'t he give the Cavs any?

Just u wait till Love and kyrie are healthy
Shaun Livingston gunning for that finals mvp
Steph: 11 points. 4-15 shooting.\nKlay: 9 points. 4-12.\nWarriors: Still win by 15.
Lue sounds extra salty in this post game. 
Everyone feels like that. LeBron and the Cavs are like that secret boss in a video game after you beat the actual final boss. Not really necessary, just an additional challenge.
i'm just here to overreact
More like trash brothers. Right?
I think if the cavs had Irving and Love they would have won this game.
Warriors in 4
We got shat on. That sucked. And Love? Soft af today man.\n\nBench points: CLE-10 GSW-45. Important stat there.\n\nThe only very very tiny shred of good news is that it was an away game.
love played well
This sub is fucking toxic during the playoffs and for some reason it seems particularly bad this year. I'll be back for the draft when people who genuinely care about the NBA are having semi-rational discussions again
My thought was that GSW was really effective at recovering on shooters at the 3pt line.  Frye didn't get his usual open looks, and once that happened he was just a liability on the floor.
Welcome to the fucking West, Cavaliers! 
this series is going to be a massacre.  when it's over warriors will probably set a record (or two or three) for how seriously they destroy their opponent.
How funny would it be if in consecutive years Curry wouldn't win finals MVP.
Not funny at all. It's a team.
because speights cannot defend
Yes! Actually, I think there are several different things they could try. Though honestly I think the biggest adjustment needed is one that they will not do. \n\nIt is my opinion that the Cav's looked to create their offense from the Post and vs Mismatches way to often. Teams often fall into this counter-intuitive trap, they see a mismatch and try to post, but that slows down the offense and doesn't give others enough touches. \n\nLBJ wants to roast people on the block, and take advantage of the incoming double, but look at the shot clock in those possessions.\n\nThe Cav's are much scarier to me when they run PnR and drive to the basket. That creates chaos, and their shooters knock down shots in chaos. 
warriors don't have a bench, they have too many starters to play at once.
I think they were up by 40 in a game in Cleveland earlier this season.
nah that was Houston
The Spurs
You're embarrassing the actual loyal warriors fans. Barbossa was crucial on those Suns teams. Dude developed the reputation for being one of the fastest players in the league.
da fuk? barbosa has been a solid player his whole career. guessing you started watching ball in 2014
too many excuses....
Ahhhhhh, shut up.
You've obviously never watched the Warriors, their bench steps up all the time this is nothing new. 
Hope your kidding. Curry's the main reason his teammates get open shots.
Who give a fuck, it's all about winning the ship. If curry gets doubled hard all series I'm sure he would gladly pass the ball out to a 4 on 3 cake bucket every possession en route to ring number two.
JFC. I am sick of seeing this every damn year for Lebron. This is the team HE wanted. They are healthy. Its the coach HE wanted. This is one of the best supporting casts hes had according to 538 http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/lebron-and-the-rest-of-the-cavs-are-better-this-year/ They have enough talent, shooting, and depth. Its a flexible and potent lineup. The issue isnt help, its the system, gameplan and chemistry. He built this team, those things are on him.\n\nAll that said they will be better in game 2, but this excuse has to go. 
The cavs have the highest salary in the nba right now
When your second best player in a Finals game is Richard Jefferson, you're gonna have a bad time
b..but Cavs fans told me that with healthy Kyrie and Love, they would be the second and third best players?\n\nwhats funny is that one can make the argument that this years Warriors are less healthy than the Cavs, Curry had a MCL sprain not too long ago, and also less rested than the Cavs. If the Cavs lose this series with a healthy Kyrie (they should feel blessed as Kyrie is never healthy), its a fucking joke. Enough with the excuses. 
I mean, would you not have said the same thing before we witnessed them shit the bed?
I liked how you left your own team out. And I never said that because of how we were shooting, I'm saying was it really all that unreasonable to think that having Love and Irving would bring a better result than what we got last year?
Dude those people just trolling, ignore em
Actually some people said the composition of the team without Love and Irving was a better matchup for the cavs.. 
Huh? The point was that people foresaw match up issues with Kyrie and Love on the roster. You didn't need to see them shit the bed to know they match up poorly with the dubs, and that they wouldn't be the second and third best player. 
tbf it was a completely reasonable thing to say.
And it wasn't just Cavs fans saying it either. Heck I said it.
It's reasonable unless you thought the Cavs would have won last year with both. The NBA is about match ups and the Cavs personnel just matchup awfully with the Warriors.
A number of GS assistant coaches (according to Zach Lowe) were actually upset when Love and Kyrie went down, because they were looking forward to matching up against them. They thought that the Cav's defensive lineups were a bigger concern, and so far that appears to be true.
Yeah hindsight is 20/20. I mean I was pretty worried about this game, even going into the half.
Well now that seems obvious, but don't forget the Cavs were up 7 at one point.
Maaaan, that shit was a whole 2 hours ago. Ancient history. They're straight ass now. 
And that lineups with Channing Frye would allow them to out shoot the Warriors.
They forgot to mention how that only works against eastern conference caliber teams
Ayyyy f u
Knicks are in the East too, he knows the struggle. \n\nI hope in the next few years the East will develop enough new blood to be competitive.
> out shoot the Warriors.\n\n...
People actually said that? Lol I'm sorry but I can't believe that
They saw the one stat that said the Cavs have been making more 3s per game in the playoffs against ECF teams and there you go
because they beat the corpse of an Atlanta team and happened to catch fire at the same time?\n\nwtf were some people smoking?
There were people during the Hawks-Cavs series that were all like "There is no team in the league that can catch fire like the Cavs" and they were taken seriously. Thats what you need to know
man the Cavs catching fire still doesn't even come close to if Klay or Steph catch fire.\n\ni guess people just really wanted the Cavs to be good enough to challenge even a little bit.
Delusion hits people in many ways. Let's try not to reason with madness. 
As they say, you can't reason someone out of a position they didn't reason themselves into in the first place.
They were supposed to bring balance to the finals, not leave it in 4 games!
Kevin and Kyrie, who were supposed to bring balance to this series, vanished.\n\nBut I believe, Lebron can save us all.\n\n\n*avatar theme*
From my point of view the Cavs are evil!
I agree. 100%.I mean have you seen Darth LeBron during his Miami days. 
I know, Kidd can't get it done himself, and Kenyon Martin isn't enough of an offensive threat 
[More like a good time](http://i.imgur.com/VXZDbwt.png)
Especially this decade 
Lol, even last decade too! Nets had a rough time back in the day...
That was a decent Nets team, too. \n\nThey just ran into a bulldozer.
Twice.
As a Jazz fan, I know that feeling all too well.\n\nI'm looking at *you*, guy.
As a 90's kid, I still get nervous when a Bulls and Jazz fan over 30 are in the same room. 
Hmm. Kerr should strongly consider resting Curry these next two games to protect him from a preseason ending injury.\n
How's Curry's family life? I think he need to take his daughter to the Zoo for game 3.
savage
Bro hes gotta be fresh for game 1 2017 nba finals
I cry for the east.
Don't even make him fly to Cleveland, just give him the keys to The Oracle and just let him shoot some 3s while they're gone. Let him watch the game from home. 
If they could, is that saying the Warriors are so good or the Cavs are playing so bad?
yes
Guys I'm feeling a little under the weather, just going to WFH\n\n-Steph
Steph, we\'ve made some strategic decisions, in order to lay down the groundwork for a three-peat. This may sound funky, but we need you to take a different role for these away games. \n\n"Ok coach. What were you guys thinking?"\n\n"We need you to be the hype man at Oracle for our away game watch parties."\n\n"What the - - Aw wth. I can bring Riley right?"
You guys are nerds 
As soon as you said Riley I was on board 
no we need his full focus on the watch party. the man has a job
With his range, Steph might actually be able to make a couple of shots in game 3 from The Oracle.
We just refer it as the Oracle in the Bay
The Bay lol what. It\'s San Francisco Bay. 
The Bay lol what. It\'s San Francisco Bay. >      99% of people also call that sarcasm

Your flair just took me back to 2004.  Best series of my life. 
-_-
Bill Simmons said it the best, we've already seen the finals this year. It's like we're watching replays of regular season games.
Yup.   Everyone knew the western conference finals were actually the finals.   We tried convincing ourself differently since the cavs ran through the east in the playoffs.  This was the outcome everyone knew 6 months ago.   The west would fight tooth and nai and the cavs would run the east.  then after a hard fought west, the Warriors would finish it out and steamroll the east. \n\nThe playoffs were so good in the West that we thought it could be different.  But we all saw this coming.  
Anyone know what time the Cavs game starts? Fucking ABC has been running Warriors highlights the past two hours.
Whoosh!
The sound of a joke going over his head or the sound of Curry pulling up from the 3?
Yes
Whoosh! 
C-C-C-COMBO WHOOSH
You must of blinked and missed it. 
Someone call the burn unit...
Bro...I've got some bad news
Shout out to the guy playing roller coaster tycoon during commercials on the stream. Solid theme park
He's got some nice song choices too. Wonder if he puts his playlist out there somewhere? Shame he won't be streaming game 3 because of his finals. Now I have to settle on a worse stream.
He usually has a link to the Spotify playlist before the game starts
https://play.spotify.com/user/handrewbrozel/playlist/0a5u7vA0kjznaAAWmqcW7J\n\nIt's pretty great! He knows how to mix a playlist to keep (most) people happy with the song choice. I hope /u/handrewbrozel doesn't mind me sharing it here.
Most of the time its just on shuffle haha, but thanks, glad you like it.
what's up man. Just wanted to say, you got me through watching the Finals last year as I graduated college and entered the real world. Now I don't need the stream anymore, got me a nice job and a good cable package. I'm not living in lavish luxury, but my girl and I do okay. You have a patreon or anything set up? I'd toss you 10-20$ to keep the lights on.
Updated ESPN Power Rankings\n\nWarriors\n\nOKC\n\nWarriors Bench\n\nCavs
If the three best teams are in the same conference one of them isn't making it out of the 2nd round.
Gotta put the Spurs there somewhere before the Cabs too
Don't forget the Spurs and at this point possibly the Blazers. 
I would actually put the Spurs where the Cavs are 
I'd put the Spurs in above the Cavs tbh
I like how you have to be super particular in order to throw shade at us. \n\n"as soon as the October 1, 2015 to present Spurs in their most recent configuration make it out of the second round..we\'ll talk!"
I mean... It does show dedication on his part xD
How deep into the warriors bench do you have to go to find a guy who would not start over JR smith?
Actual JR Smith or JR Smith that's as good as JR Smith think's JR Smith is?
Haha we can do both. \n\n>Actual JR smith: \n\n9 Warriors, or wherever you cut off at Barbosa\n\n> JR Smith that's as good as JR Smith think's JR Smith is\n\n0 Warriors.
LOL. I was thinking the exact same thing. If this dude's serious I'm thinking Barbosa is the gauge. 
No way would barbosa start over jr smith on any team.  The lack of spacing would be atrocious.  However I don't think either should start on a championship team.
What about a shampionship team?
Good thing the Cavs drafted Andrew Wiggins to be a good defender of multiple positions.......oh wait
It's actually funny his future is better then the Cavaliers atm.
Let's not get too crazy here yet. The wolves although super young have to still make the playoffs. The team didn't even win 30 games. The Cavs are getting destroyed but still a top 5 team and likely to be that next year.
At first I was salty about losing Love, but then when I realized that if Cleveland didn't win this year, they fucked themselves while giving us Wiggins for basically free, I felt much better 
I agree on KAT, Wiggins is a push, and you're going a little too far with lavine.
Did you have a stroke? Should I call 911?
Had the exact same reaction honestly. I remember thinking "fuuuck, Love was the "leader" of the Wolves, now we\'re super fucked". Two years later, and we\'re still fucked but now theres potential to eventually be a legitimate threat
KAT will be 5 times the player Love will ever be.
Agreed, if we can just get him to stay around. I get ragged on a lot for being a Wolves fan (especially living in Wisconsin) but I have high hopes
4 year rookie contract, RFA afterwards. Assuming we give him the max that only we can, 9 years of KAT. If we can't make it work in that time, fair game.
You have Thibs.  You'll win at least 40 games next year. I promise. 
I wouldn't stop at 40, Wolves are huge sleepers
KAT 105/60 on 225% shooting confirmed
This is only his Rookie season and he already has 5 times as many rings and Mvps as Love.
However, Love also has 10 times as many FMVPs and MIPs than KAT.
Blatt's NBA career died for this
I can only imagine what this team would look like if they'd bought into Blatt's system...
Yeah, Lue looked good against the competition in the east but he's not ready for the boys in the west. 
This series is a really bad look for the East. 
The Warriors are just really good and the worst possible matchup for the Cavs, I honestly think a Thunder-Cavs series would have gone 7 (probably would lean towards the Thunder but much closer). The NBA is all about match ups and the Warriors death lineup is unbeatable against the Cavs.
>This ~~series~~ season is a really bad look for the East. \n\n
Decade\n\nEdit: Entire post-MJ era
Lets be real, the East never looked good.
Everyone couldn't stop talking about how the east caught the west thus year. Jokes on them. 
Thats why they are morons lolz
Yeah, the Raptors really had to struggle their way to a couple of wins. That said, I at least expected the Cavs to be competitive in this series. 
Replace "expected" with "hoped" and I think that\'s more realistic. The difference in ability is amazing though, and I think Kerr is straight out coaching everyone this playoffs.
I don't know about that, Billy Donovan had him on the ropes for a while. Klay Thompson had to go god-mode to keep us in the WCF, remember? Everybody else though, yeah I would say he out coached them handily. 
God mode was really game 6 but I see your point. However I would argue that the adjustments that Kerr made were key as well, but obviously the guys on the court are making the plays.
Yes, it was game six, but still the WCF in a win or go home situation. \n\nAlso, you're right Kerr definitely made some moves. I didn't mean to imply he got caught with his pants around his ankles. What I was trying to say was that Billy Donovan basically hung in there with him punch for punch but in the end Warriors sealed the deal when they stole game 6 in Oklahoma. As far as I (and pretty much everyone I know) was concerned, game 7 was just a formality. 
Game 7 certainly was, but this entire series is turning out to be just a formality haha
remember when the East had a winning record against the west earlier in the regular season? pepperidge farm remembers
The East had more above average teams than the West had. The West just has most of the great teams.
4-1 is my count. Probably won't change for next year either unless KD really surprises everyone.
Only KD can bring balance to the force. 
Help me KD-Wan Kenobi... You're my only hope...
Lol this series is going to just keep him away from the East. His best chance to be in the finals with an actual chance to win is in okc.
Plz KD
http://i.imgur.com/lET082i.png
Haha that's perfect 
Fucking LMAO. Best meme of the night
So true. When you realize you actually have to defend
lmao chance the fapper
Kyrie Irving this series:\n\n12 for 36 FG (.333)\n\n1 for 7 3 pt (.143)\n\n5 assists, 6 turnovers\n\nGetting abused on defense\n\nJust straight up showing up small on his biggest stage
I mean they might be better without him for this series. Delay could be a better option. 
Exactly. The Cavs have to delay the series until they can get a better team together. 
Sigh... back to rigging the lottery
Nothing sums up his ability to run the offence more than the play in 4th quarter where Mozgov had a mismatch against Barbosa. Mozgov was calling for it but kyrie ignored him while trying to beat his man off the dribble, but then almost lost the ball so he gave it to Delly who immediately called Mozgov into the post and gave him the ball to take advantage of the mismatch
complete turnaround from last year where he was killing it in game one on offense.  they're missing kyrie and smith on offense big time.  and when they aren't scoring, it is going to go down hill fast.  as we have seen in two games so far.
The problem is Cleveland had success with their spot up shooters against bad defenses and thought they could keep up with GS's shooters. Only Lebron and Kyrie can create their own shot and the rest of the team doesn't pass or shoot well enough to match GS.
It comes down to the old adage "A jack of all trades, master of none, is often better, than a master of one" (btw yes that\'s the full saying). The Warriors just have guys that do absolutely everything. And you got Lebron to do that for the Cavs. It\'s a matchup hell for the cavs
The biggest part of the Warriors is just how relentless they are on offense and if you go cold at any point, it's extremely demoralizing. That seems to be what's going on here.
if you cannot neutralize the warrior's runs it's over.  and with how bad cleveland's offense has been, they cannot even recover if a early run in the game gets away from them.
How can you make that comparison when wall hasn't had a chance to be on the big stage....Kyrie has a great playoffs till now 
Lmao
Wall has taken his team to the playoffs and gone sorta deep as well as the clear cut leader. Kyrie wouldn't do that as the leader. Most likely lotto
lol remind me last time kyrie led team to playoffs????
Idk man, Wall was absolutely filthy last year in the playoffs. 
I see where you're coming from, but John Wall is easily the best player on his team and he's taken teams to the playoffs and might have made the ECF last year if he didn't hurt his hand.\n\nKyrie had several years being the best player on his team before Lebron came back to Cleveland and the most he ever won was 33 games.
is this a joke? he was a hand injury away from being the best player on a conference finals team. what has kyrie done solo? 
Maybe, but that shit would have gone to seven for sure.
Yeah on a conference finals team *that doesn't have Lebron* hahaha what kind of argument is that 
And wall doesn't have two other stars on his team, with one being LeBron James.  I'm sure he'd have more success too
Seriously. The people criticizing Wall for not having as much playoff success as Kyrie are insane. Kyrie didn't lead the Cavs to shit before LeBron came. If the counter to that point is that the Cavs didn't have much talent elsewhere to help Kyrie, then you can't criticize Wall this season for not leading his team to the playoffs. Wall's team really needs to improve in terms of talent, coaching, and luck with injuries.\n\nI think the Cavs are a much better team if you replace Kyrie with Wall and I think the Wizards don't reach the playoffs this year with Kyrie instead of Wall. 
Reason why I shit on Kyrie as much as possible.
We didn't. We came to an agreement that wall was better 
the Toronto Raptor Fan Base 
People shit on us when we say Lowry's better. At least Lowry plays D when he sucks.
I have always thought that the only thing Irving has over Wall is his scoring and he's not even doing that well right now
shit at least Wall can defend well. hoping to see him on the come up next season.
Maybe he'll get a superstar team mate. One can only hope.
KD?
i presume it could be someone starting with a "K"? HMMM.
Kendrick Perkins?
Kris Humphries?
He is imo, people are just obsessed with Kyrie's handles and all his marketing that they forgot who truly is better. Wall plays great defense too, something Kyrie can only dream of having.
Kyrie's a straight up scrub
Kyrie is a better scorer but Wall is significantly better overall
Kyrie got that crazy handle; however, the last time I checked handles is only one part of offense.
That and he's better at 3s\n\n
Wall shot better percentage from three this year along with more PPG, assists, rebounds, steals and blocks, all while having to be the number one option on offense considering Beal's injury woes. 
Really? Lol my god Kyrie 
And Wall didn't have arguably the greatest player in the world to take the pressure off him. No star PG is asked to do more with less than Wall. Maybe Dame but his coach is great and his team was healthy this year.
Kyrie would probably be much better if he didnt dribble so well. It sounds stupid, but I think his talent entices him to overdribble way too much. 
I kind of get a similar vibe watching Westbrook when okc is down late in a game. His speed and strength let him push the pace and let him get too far into a hopeless drive and then he either has to Chuck a shot or dish an awkward pass that if it connects leads to a teammate taking a shot that's just as bad
lol Uncle Drew marketing is real. That's why my lil bro dick rides Kyrie.
Wall is a better playmaker too
John Wall looks like he's been in and won fights.  Kyrie looks like a dude who believes in using your words.
He's probably the second best playmaker in the league. Anyone have thoughts on this? I could be wrong. I'd say CP3 is number 1. 
No arguments on that, closest to contest that #2 spot would be Rondo.
I've been to one Wizards game, and I swear to god Wall would've had like 25 assists if his teammates could actually hit open shots. I was blown away by how fast he was out there
By far.
Wall is cuter too.
Them being drunk college chicks on a campus that is 73% female probably helped lead to it.  
Nice name 
Woaaah, settle down. Have you seen Kyrie doing his laundry? 
Where the hell is this thread taking me?
His face and voice when saying that "that my be my duvet" line are smooth as silk. 
It's like the warriors are having a party next door
Underrated comment lol
http://oi61.tinypic.com/oa907a.jpg
Good thing he was healthy this year.
If I recall correctly, the line-up of death didn't exist at that time last year (I think it debuted in game 3?). Last year, both teams were in the first year of a first time NBA head coach. Kerr hadn't come up with the line-up of death until after Kyrie went down. Kerr is so much better at manipulating his line-ups in his second year, meanwhile Lue is just halfway through his first season and has a lot to learn about rotations and the strengths and weaknesses of his roster. Dan Gilbert and LeBron fucked their own chances at winning the championship when they fired Blatt and they deserve to get embarrassed in the Finals for it.\n\nAnyways, I think that Kyrie was successful in game 1 last year because Kerr just wasn't experienced enough to know how to shut down Kyrie on defense, and take advantage of his shortcomings as a defender.
*This 1000%* What's funny is most of the intelligent basketball breakdown websites I read and pods I listen to have been preaching this all year. \n\nIn Zach Lowe's preview he talked about how last year the Warriors assistant coaches and staff were actually concerned when Love and Kyrie went down; because, they were looking forward to those matchups. 
Offensively they are. Defensively they are not. Unfortunately for the Cav's you have to play both. We are literally seeing this play out in front of us. \n\nKyrie's defense is like hot Nas's rap albums, he had 1 good one in 10.\n\nLOL, at the guy with no flair bitching about bandwagon flair. \n\nI am sorry that my enjoyment of the game bothers you. I am sorry the Final's are proving an argument you dont like has merit. I am sorry we just get to watch the Finals games that are presented. 
Coming into the series I thought their Big 3 would be outmatched, but I didn't think it would be nearly this bad.  I'm not sure if it's just the Ws playing refined basketball after nearly going down to the Thunder or what.  Cavs look like a team playing in November out there.
I thought they'd be outmatched too. By our starters.
Don't mess with Andre and the Brazilian Blur! 
Would've been 5/5 *again* if he didn't have to take that 40 ft 3-pointer with the shot clock running out\n\nEdit: Forgot he missed that corner three in garbage time too
> I'm not sure if it's just the Ws playing refined basketball after nearly going down to the Thunder or what.\n\nOr maybe the Cavs wouldn't have beaten OKC either and are just a product of a weaker eastern conference.
This. Cavs are the 4th best team in the West. And its a 7 game series against a healthy Clippers team.
This Cavs team is too healthy for the Cavs.
No big chips on their shoulders 
it's funny that last year's Cavs would probably beat this year's Cavs.
Coaching makes a hell of a difference.
I don't think it's the coaching. Lue can't really put Delly in over Kyrie, even though it would be a tougher matchup. Mosgov and Thompson would be a good 1-2 punch but really, they're just overmatched. They don't have the personnel.
I mean, every single Cav is playing poorly. That falls on coaching. 
Ideally you\'d want 5 players on-court who can play on both sides of the ball. A Miami Heat line-up would look like Chalmers, Wade, LeBron, Bosh, Birdman back then. In that line-up, all 5 could defend, with 3 defending at all-NBA levels. Even if they brought on a poor defensive player, they could be covered by the other 4. Offensively, transition defence for the opposition was impossible when Wade and LeBron were running the floor. 3-ball came courtesy of Chalmers and Bosh plus off the bench from James Jones, Ray Allen, Mike Miller, and Shane Battier. The fact is while LeBron needs snipers around him, they don\'t have to be the starters necessarily. A LeBron + rim protector + 3 sniper line-up would be deadly against benches, but doesn\'t work against the opposition\'s starters. It doesn\'t help that LeBron\'s range has shrunk to 3 feet for some reason.\n\nAt Cleveland, they start with Kyrie, JR, LeBron, Love, TT. Out of those, 3 can defend at a good level (1 of which at all-NBA level). Love is a sub-par defender, but at least he has size. Kyrie is a small sub-par defender, which makes him and Love both defensive liabilities. Now hiding 2 players just isn\'t as easy as 1 and it hurts on court. People ask, "Rubio can\'t shoot, why\'s he useful?" One of the many reasons is that we never have to hide him on defence. In fact, anybody who\'s watched Rubio will tell you he\'s one of the best defensive PGs in the league.\n\nOff the bench, they have Shump, RJ, and Delly who play good defence. This is the opposite of what he had at Heat with defence coming off the bench now.\n\nCompare this to GSW, who can go Curry, Klay, Iggy, Green, Bogut. 4/5 are plus defenders and Curry is average/above average. They bring in Barnes (+ defender), Livingston (+ defender) as well. Defence is the key to a successful NBA team and how LeBron/Cavaliers have neglected that I\'ll never know. Before Warriors, there were the Spurs who built their team on the defence of Kawhi, Duncan, and Danny Green versus the Heat. Before them, the Heat themselves. The Mavericks had Tyson Chandler as a defensive rock I believe.\n\nThe team that gave the Warriors most trouble is also the best defensive outfit they faced (not consistency wise, but ability wise): Westbrook, Roberson, Durant, Ibaka, Adams is an absolute defensive nightmare with 5 PLUS DEFENDERS! No wonder they struggled! Even Adams could guard on switches. Defence wins championships, and the Cavs just don\'t have it. Unless they catch fire or Irving/Love make a massive defensive step up, they just can\'t pull it off this year.
Delly, JR, LeBron, TT, Mozgov. Rim protector + all 5 are at least average defenders. Delly is a plus defender, LeBron is an elite defender, etc. Offence is lacking, but defence is there. LeBron reduces that offensive disparity by slowing down the pace and grinding in the post. The positives are that they have height in attack as well (lobs, putbacks) and they can space the floor very minimally through JR and Delly. However, the lane is now jammed with two interior players. Ideally for this to succeed, LeBron would've had to have a functional mid-range game so that Mozgov/TT would clean up boards and LeBron could help spread the floor as well.\n\nNow, the thing is while Kyrie and Love are better offensive players, they're not producing on that end. And because of the lack of offensive production and defensive slack, they become net negative players. For them to be as good of a matchup as Delly/Mozgov were last year, both would have to produce good offence and be average defensively (opposite of Delly/Mozgov). That is just to be equal, mind you! And of course, good offence is harder to produce when the defenders you face are elite/above average. Defence is about fundamentals and intelligence (demonstrated by Iggy every night), offence requires intelligence, intuition, and innovation.
>  They don't have the personnel.\n\nHilarious given the Cav's payroll.
Yeah, it's not like they have the highest luxury tax in history!
We can all agree the GM Lebron is definitely worse than player Lebron. Arguably Coach Lebron is better than GM Lebron.
Shumpert and Mozgov being shells of what they were last year won't do the Cavs any good too.
What happened to Shumpert?
So..Lebron was a better coach last season?
No LeBron had a coach last season.. Now he has Lue who is his whipping boy, getting ride of Blatt was a bad idea in my view 
And defense.  They'd prob be better off benching Kyrie and Love which is crazy that injuries did anyway last year.  The last Finals may be viewed VERY differently in context if the Cavs get swept.
And pre-knee-surgery Moz was such an underrated player. He really showed up that series on both sides of the court. And more importantly, he was the rim protector for the team. A role that is currently nonexistent.
I actually think that Kyrie and Love make them worse. They are the type of players that numbers lie about. There's a reason their teams never made the playoffs when they lead them.
There's more to why Love didn't bring the Wolves to the playoffs. 
David Blatt is the first coach in NBA history whose name looks like his face
I don't care who you are, that's funny right there.

Hah
He won't be flying economy. 
I was once on a flight to San Antonio from Dallas with Michael Finley in 2008.  I think it was right before the second round of the playoffs started.  Some sweet old lady recognized Finley and she told him she was sorry to see that the Mavs got eliminated in the 1st round.  I got a nice laugh watching Finley kindly explain to her that he was on the Spurs and he didn\'t play for the Mavs anymore.  \n\nThen when the boarding call came, he got on the plane while I waited for my group to be called.  When I got on the plane I was confused because I didn\'t see Findog in First Class.  I make it back into coach where my seat is and I see Finley, all 6\'7" of him in a middle seat sandwiched in between two people that were probably 5 and change.  It was the most awkward looking thing to see.  I kinda felt bad for him. I thought about offering him my isle seat, but he was with the Spurs so there was nothing I could do for him.
wow the Cleve got some cheap ass flights. nice
As a Laker fan, it\'s great to see Dan Gilbert\'s "super team" get curbed stomped after he whined like a baby to block the CP3 to LA deal.
That was some bullshit. I mean, fuck the Lakers, but y'all got hosed there and it set a poor president. 
Why bring politics into this?
What super team?
Kyrie, Love & LeBron
whoosh
I agree. I tried explaining this to my non-Lakers-fan roommates but they think I'm being petty. I probably am, but fuck Dan Gilbert.
I have the biggest schadenboner right now.

Or anyone else to make a real effort. Sad, considering it looked like LeBron tried to get the team involved and they weren't having any of it. 
> Sad, considering it looked like LeBron tried to get the team involved and they weren't having any of it.\n\nYeah I feel fucking bad for Lebron. Either get called a ball hog, or fail to carry the team. 
Kyrie and Love are nowhere near the level of Wade and Bosh. No matter how good you are, you need other great players around you, and Cleveland doesn't seem to have that.
Omfg stop that 'lebron need more help' bullshit\n\nHe had the help, he just fire him 
In their prime of their careers? Sure,I agree. But Kyrie was a superstar PG when Lebron joined the Cavs and was trying to become more than that, to reach that top 5 in the NBA level that Wade was at for many years. Similarly Love was a top 10 player in the NBA (albeit on a terrible team) when Lebron joined the Cavs. They are not at that level anymore, very clearly, but still you can't come up with a million excuses. Truly great players make good players play up to their level. 
Kyrie wasn't a superstar point guard. He's just had crazy hype because he's still young and he was a #1 pick
This is a really shitty way to defend my argument so im gonna concede and say you won, but if you look back at the posts from when Lebron joined the Cavs on this sub 90% of people said he was going to a better team. 
Well like I said, people had good reason to think that because kyrie *looked* like he could be a very good compliment to lebron. Everyone thought he would be this elite shooter that lebron would be kicking it to.  People also thought klove was better than he is...but as a wolves fan I knew he'd get exposed for what he is
They were last week
When the Cavs were setting records with 3-point shooting I saw this excuse nowhere. The Cavs have a great team, but they're up against a historic one.
Well yeah.... Wade is arguably the third best SG of all time and is top five minimum and Bosh was one of the best pfs in his time. Not really comparable. They all have very different games
That's why he said arguably, cause it's gonna come down to opinion at  a certain point.
I mean it was a completely different game 25-50 years ago. so its very hard to compare
Well because now it's a career you have kids that grew up and dreamed of playing basketball and practiced all their life to be as good as they are now. Jerry west did not have an entire generation to look up to as an icon and give him the motivation to be the very best at a young age
It is comparable.  Lebron is playing with them.  Jesus fucking christ get your head in the game.
Wasn't Love an All Star double double machine who was considered one of the best PF's in the league? What happened to him.
He's no longer literally the only good player on his team?
Sure he does.  He's a true PF who can hit a high percentage from 3pt.  That's one of the most valuable things you can be in the NBA on offense.  He can even create his own shot when necessary.\n\nHis problem is that his defense sucks.  Bosh learned to hit the corner 3, and he was a good rim protector, good weakside help defender, super long arms.  Draymond can hit the 3 and switch onto any play on the cavs - he can guard Kyrie, or Mozgov, or LeBron.  \n\nKevin Love can hit the 3, and then gets roasted in the PNR on the other end.  That's the difference between the ELITE power forwards and Kevin Love.  His offense is fine, his defense blows.
I don't know a lot about basketball, but I was so impressed by how Bosh accepted his role and changed his game to make everything work. Playing center, adding a 3pt shot to his game, focusing more on defense than on getting 25 points a game. It sucks he has these problems with blood clots. 
Bosh is an all-around great guy; he's smart, caring, and humble. I hope he gets healthy.
We're getting somewhat used to seeing LeBron having to do it all in the Final with a weak supporting cast (even the Heat in 2014 looked old and tired) but LeBron is not really doing it all so far.  I've never seen him so well-guarded at the rim, even including several signature unstoppable drives.
No doubt GSW is playing great defense, but LeBron is also not getting any younger. You can see it on some plays where you think afterwards that his first step used to be quicker or his jump a bit higher. 
To be fair, Miami shot well that series. The Spurs shooters were just unreal that time. 
Unreal wouldn't be the word to use bruh. More like historic. When was the last time a Finals team came into the series so focused and on a mission? Even the 2001 Lakers dropped game 1 to Iverson.

Damn Cleveland... All I'm waiting for now is Lebron to announce that he is going back to South Beach at the end of the season
How much of a hit would it be for his legacy if he did that? 
He\'d basicall reveal his "Return" letter was a big fat lie for PR. I mean he wrote that he wants to commit to the process of bringing a chip to Cleveland, even if it takes some time.
He's going back to college to get his masters.
I don't want him to leave again, but I also wanna watch him sucker punch an entire city by leaving again.
He can't leave. The big story his last free agency was and the letter he put in sports illustrated. He's tied to Cleveland unless he wants to be the villain again.
We already got what we needed.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/xnDykks\n\nThank you North East Ohio for raising LeBron 
fuck I would be so pissed if I were a cavs fan. I cant even imagine this scenario with wade. 
That heat team was something special
It's amazing what can happen when allstars collude to take pay cuts to play together because they can't win separately. Truly special.
We could have made it another year had he not left. But then again, maybe we wouldn't have Whiteside.. or we would have.. 
We definitely wouldn't have Winslow or Josh Richardson, so that's a plus.\n
Well we have them now.. LeBron back for grad school confirmed? 
The way Miami was this year. They would've made the finals with LeBron and it would've been a good one. 
LeBron gets a max so who on the Heat now isn't on the roster?\n\nBut yeah I can still agree. Wade played great this season.
If LeBron was on the Heat, they wouldn't have the players they currently have & they wouldn't have lost enough games to get a good player in Winslow. \n\nBosh would most definitely still have his health troubles.\n\nI think his situation here is better than whatever situation that version of Heat would be in.\n\nBut yes a \n\nDragic - Wade - Deng - LeBron - Whiteside lineup would wreak havok.
We could have been a dynasty if he stayed.
Doesn't it seems like any Eastern Conference playoff team would have made the finals this year if they had LeBron?
> They would've made the finals with LeBron and it would've been a good one.\n\nTo be fair, a lot of teams would have made the finals with LeBron.
Fuck even the 76e... hahaha who am I kidding \xf0\x9f\x98\x82
Even the 76ers would likely have made the finals with Lebron James.\n\nLebron would not want to waste his prime, so would have demanded they trade Okafor, Embiid, Saric and what , 5 future 1st in the next 2 drafts including the Lakers great pick next year top 1 protected and that Kings pick still to come, to surround a fine Noel-Covington-Lebron frontline (Noel a quick rim protector, Covington is a nice fit as the Richard Jefferson/Battier esque 3pt shooting forward) with very competent starting guards and a couple of solid bench guys to round out the rotation.\n\nWould have taken a strong Lebron effort but I think he'd have beaten the Raps in 6 or 7 assumng those trades aren't mishandled. \n\nThe only team I could see being unable to beat Detroit, Atlanta or Toronto would have been Brooklyn, since they'd have damn near no assets to get good guards to go with a fine Lopez-Lebron-ThadYoung frontline. And even then, the Celtics 2017 pick (could they have even traded that legally?) and the far in the future Nets 1sts would have probably gotten them at least some Courtney Lee and  type motherfuckers to give Lebron just enough help to heroically drag his team to the finals and lose in 4 to the Dubs.
Cleveland would declare war on Miami.
I just realized this isn't the only sport that Miami has broken Clevelands heart in.
Given their track record at any competitive event they'd lose 
Its aight we got Tywin Lannister, we know how this would end.
Tywin dying on the shitter?
Lebron: "What happeend to Cole?"\n\nRiley: "I suppose the GM sent him on his way."\n\nLebron: "Sent him away where?"\n\nRiley: "Wherever whores go"

> Stephen Curry  18 points\n\nIs everyone ready for that sweet Star Wars erotica ft. /u/benjamin_finneran
Oh im ready and I didnt have to eat an onion so today is great day.
He dun goofed.
I think he actually wants to do it, or else he would have said 15 or so instead of 22.
The Splash Brothers might as well have not been on the floor for Game 1 and the Cavs lost by 15. Tonight, they had an okay game and it was an absolute blowout. If they have a normal game in Cleveland on Wednesday, the NBA might just call the series. 
I mean this entire thread is all about the hyperbole.....
i know its almost as dumb as thinking a team could go 73-9 or that a player could hit over 400 threes in a season or taking a very clearly not serious comment seriously
you thinking 60 point blowout?
Mercy rule 
So what you're saying is Warriors in 3?
I'd say Steph and Klay both had good games today.  They just didn't play and shoot alot.  Their passing/defense/rebounding was on point tonight.
They were okay, but they were both below their average and Klay especially missed a couple of shots that he should hit. It was definitely an improvement on Game 1 though. That said, if they combine for 50+ on Wednesday like they usually do, then it is going to be really ugly with the way Cleveland is playing. 
Steph only played 25 min though. If he had played a normal 35, he'd have 25+. He had a pretty good game, just didn't play much.
He didn't play mug because they didn't need him. Had it been a close game, there's no way he only plays 25 min. 
Shot 7/11 from the field and 4/8 from 3 in 24 minutes tonight.  I think we have different definitions of not doing shit.  At this point Draymond is finals MVP, but to say Steph has been playing poorly is straight up BS.  His 3's were money tonight, and he had some sick drives to the rim. He had 7 first half rebounds in limited minutes.  But ya, he hasnt dont shit smh
And because the cavaliers got REKT
they weren't the usual splash brothers they were about .25 splash brothers and they blew em out by 30. first game they were nonexistent and they blew them out by 15. Cavs have no chance.
If Klay and Steph are at 100% and they don't win by 120 I'm gonna be seriously disappointed. 
Curry foul trouble killed his minutes, but he shot efficiently when he was out there
Hes shooting slightly better from the field than lebron in the 2 games.\n\nThis game he started 0/3 and then proceeded to shoot 7/8
This series would be so different if the Cavs had Kyrie and Love.
Lebron signed up to do Space Jam 2. Looks like the aliens took the LBJs teammates skills too soon to prep for the movie
I\'m a historian of the game. I never seen a team win minus two all stars
I know Cavs fans used that excuse last year, but the fact that they can't defend, and force Cleveland to run fast (exactly what the Warriors want) made it annoying to hear every time someone would say how that was why they lost.\n\nKyrie and K-Love are individually better players than Delly and TT/Mozgov. But they are terrible players to have in this series.
They are better but not good enough to beat this team. I would take Westbrook/Ibaka over Irving/Love in nearly every series.
> I would take Westbrook/Ibaka over Irving/Love in nearly every series.\n\nLiterally every series. Although part of what we're saying here is we'd take Donovan over Lue... or rather a good coach over a not-really-a-real-coach. 
I don't care if the Cavs have the reincarnated Red Auerbach, the team just isn't good enough to beat the Warriors
I think they get swept. I think with a great coach they win a game. With an all-time coach they win two, maybe three. Good coaching means things like knowing how to throw a team off its game. Look at the WCF, they absolutely threw the Ws off their game and stole a game in Oakland, then all bets were off. Great coaching is what it takes to beat a team as good as the Ws, and while it's still almost certainly not enough to win a 7 game series against them it's probably enough to win a game or two at home.
But OKC had the personnel to pull it off. I don't think that's a fair example. \n\nMy thoughts on playoffs OKC: nightmare matchup for any basketball team, ever.
It wasn't just the matchups, though. Donovan called all the right personnel changes in those games they dominated, conceited all the right fouls. The dude made a great game into a dumpster-fest with intelligence and I loved it, and I think we all did to be real, even dubs fans in a weird way. It was good fucking basketball on the underdogs part. Shame they couldn't finish, but it was beautiful while it lasted.\n\nI'll take that series where my team loses but puts the best fight anyone has all season over the series where my team goes 4-0 in every time to win it. A championship is cool, but I watch for the game itself, not the award ceremony. Shit, my niece got an award for graduating 1st grade this year.\n\nIt's the journey, the plays, the teachers, the coaches that make it worth it to a fan. I'm drunk. And a tad sad. And this was a rant. Love you guys!\n\n<3\n\n/rant
Wait a second...
To be fair, Love got a concussion and Irving was forced to play basketball. 
Defense. The word you are looking for is defense
They still lost game 1 and they were already on the way to a blowout before Love went down. Result would have been the same regardless since Love is a liability defensively.
Love gets a pass-ish, he was playing terrible ball the past 2 games, and he'd still get abused hard on defense all game. This is sad how far he's come from that 25/15 player.
He was 25/15 guy on a team where he was the 1-5th option. I always thought he was incredibly overated and i still stand by that 
I think Love is getting the Bosh treatment, being relegated to shooting long range jumpers. Except Bosh adapted much better to that role, in large part because he plays defense and has heart.
I really hope they trade him. I want to see dominant Kevin Love again, even if it's on a 40 win team.
Not going to happen. Love is a good example of a decent player on a horrible team. He could rack up numbers when no one cared cause his team was going to lose anyways. Perimeter defense in the east has been horrible this postseason, so he hasn't been exposed. 
The past two games? I thought he did well in Game 1. Also, Love averaged 25/15 back when he was the main guy for Minnesota, I wouldn't expect him to do that now. 
He put up good numbers but he's still getting abused hard on defense. I know he was the main guy and now the third option but he doesn't even resemble that same player anymore, he's timid and doesn't look for his shot as much.
Oh,  I totally agree about the defense. Honestly,  I thought the whole offensive "slump" was desired - in the sense that not only are you the third option,  but we\'re going to rely on you to focus on the things that don\'t show up in the stat sheet. But maybe that\'s me. 
That's the thing, it seems like Love contributes 2 things: scoring and rebounds. He's not a crazy good passer except for his outlets, he's not a good ball handler or creator, he can't create his own shot, he's not super quick. He legit just doesn't fit in with Cleveland, and its so strange. Love was my favorite player, I was upset when he went to Cleveland, but its even more upsetting to not be that same player anymore.
They also got rid of a player that would could help them more now and be better for them in the long term to get Love
Maybe he needs to go back to being chubby 
A Cavs fan suggested that. He doesn't seem to play as well in the post or work for boards as much anymore.
They're paying Tristan Thompson an ass-ton of money to do that, but only one of them has the ability to stretch defenses from beyond the arc. 
The Western "literally the Finals" Conference Finals
The Spurs would've handled this Cavs team too. I think Portland would be an even match
Blazers fan checking in. Love my dudes, but no it wouldn't.
>Portland would be an even match\n\nHere, you see /r/nba with its classic extreme overreaction to two games against one of the best teams ever. 
Portland wouldn't have even made it out of the first round if the Clippers whole team didn't get hurt 
Healthy clippers wouldve given them a run
Healthy clippers would have given the warriors a run.
Lol the Warriors are "lucky they avoided the Clippers and Spurs." 
Holy shit the reactionary....
no way. Portland got the benefit of CP3/BG injury and Curry injury. The Warriors were good, but def a step down without Curry
I wouldnt go as far as Portland. The top 4 seeds, healthy, sure.
Yeah, Portland would take a game or two from them if Lillard/McCollum got hot, but there's no way that they could defend the Cavs over the course of a series. 
Really glad I attempted to convert my gf into an NBA fan during the WCF and not the Finals. 
Game 6 WCF was the culmination and best game  of the season.
Yup. The season was over the moment GS went up 104-101 and OKC responded by attempting a statement 3-ptr instead of playing the way they did all series.
Just like the good ol'days
Where is good ole u/DeanBlandino when you need him to cherry pick information to make the East look equal to the West?
It has to do with winning the Finals, right?
You know that the Cavs have to win a road game to win this series, right?
But the Cavs are healthy this time
kevin love aint even good at basketball
I don't think people realized how poor Love and Irving are on defense. 
We do realize but you swept the east practically with those holes in your team. Which says how bad the east is
They also have Ty Lue as their coach, something I think people are finally starting to realize is devastating to the Cavs. I truly don't think he was ever qualified to lead a team to the Championship in the first place. It seemed like a ridiculously reactionary move, with more focus on chemistry than basketball. Warriors are still outclassing them in every facet though, including coaching.
east coast sucks. clippers woulda swept the cavs
OKC played one hell of a series and were a few shots short of being in the finals. Based on the Warriors resilience in coming back from 1-3 I don't think any team could have swept them per se. It's not a guaranteed win vs a good west coast team, but it would have been a good series vs healthy Clippers. \n\nCavs finals is so boring to watch.
U got downvoted because people STILL fucking believe that the east is on par or barely below par
Don't know about the clippers but OKC sure as fuck would have. 
Draymond Green just put this entire subreddit on suicide watch.
I don't mind the Warriors winning, because I like most of their players (besides Draymond). I really don't want him getting Finals MVP, though. If Livingston gets FMVP, I will cry tears of joy.
God I pray he wins nba mvp 
i wouldn't be surprised if draymond green sneezing made it to the front page of this sub tbh
Draymond making a pbj makes national television...
It'd be pretty funny if he sneezed on a Cavs player while defending him.
THIS MAN NEEDS TO BE STOPPED!!!!!!
As a Michigan State fan I've been enjoying his success with the Warriors. The hate makes it more fun. 
Even though I want  GSW to win, I actually have no NBA rooting interests. I just bandwagon on the Spartan du jour. I hope Valentine wins rookie of the year next year.
https://streamable.com/ncff\n\n\n
Not the entire sub :)
At least msu fans are happy.
I love it. Early on but it's looking like he has a shot at Finals MVP? Imagine the salt if he does
I will be slightly upset because it means Iguodala will not win Finals MVP.
The best outcome possible is Livingston FMVP, if I'm being honest
It really depends now right. Who knows who's going to step up for game 3. We could be looking at Finals MVP Ian Clark. 
I'm thinking more about how the Warrior haters will start critiquing Steph for not being the Finals MVP in either of the Finals he's been in.
He should have gotten it last year in my opinion(not to diminish what iguodala did). Realistically doesnt matter to most people. His impact on the game is very apparent. 
Green was good but Steph had all the offense in the games that mattered. Besides his one bad game early in the series, he took over offensively and made the big shots. 
LeBron really should've been the Finals MVP last year.
No way. Iguodala definitely earned it last year and I'm glad he got it. I was afraid they were just going to give it to Steph just because he's Steph.
Iguodala had a great impact but it could have easily gone to Steph. He literally hit the biggest shots down the stretch and everyone thought he had a bad series because of one game. \n\nBecause of that narrative that stuck for some reason, he was basically out of the running. Iguodala definitely had a good series overall and a great one defensively. 
I feel that the off-ball impact is underrated. Curry is an elite scorer so imagine all the energy that goes into guarding him, especially this finals series. Him being on the floor improves the play of his teammates just from the defense and energy required to limit him. Then there are the stats.\n\nHowever, I would give MVP to Klay because I think it should be awarded for playoffs not just finals, and Klay deserves it as much as Curry I think. Thinking of game 6 vs OKC.
Just say more. Klay has been better than Curry these playoffs he literally saved his team game 6. Game 4 they made it a game for a bit when he scored 18 in a quarter. 
If you only watch Curry for a number of possessions, you really see the impact he has on every other defender on the floor. 
Not understanding that the W is bigger than the box score, or an award. Silly of them
He\'s a big moment kind of player, shows up when his team needs him, sparks those runs that erase 15 point deficits. He\'s hardly needed to get out of bed yet in this series. Who knows, it might be a different story in Cleveland, but I\'m totally fine if he cruises through the finals the way "the King" cruises through the regular season.
I don\'t like his attitude. But if anybody thinks he\'s a bad player... **they\'re** blind. He has some loose screws, but he\'s a GREAT player. \n\nIf he had a Tim Duncan attitude towards people everybody would be "I want him in my team"\n\nSorry for the shitty English.\n\nPS: Thanks /r/the_marcorubio
But his attitude is part of what makes him great. He gets everyone fired up. Unfortunately he takes it too far sometimes. He needs to take a page out of KG's book and keep it cleaner.
KG was always a dirty player. Do you not remember when he hit frye In the nuts?
You're crazy if you don't want him on your team. I'd take him on my team any day of the week and I will enjoy every salty reaction towards him. You think Celtics fans gave a fuck that Garnett was a piece of shit when he joined them? Fuck no. That's a straight up baller and winner right there.

Iman Shumpert and JR Smith are trash
You think he'd stop shooting 3s long before reaching 0-8.
I feel like JR doesn't really do much else anyway.
Not really. He's a three point shooter, he has to keep taking them. 
BREAKING: J.R Smith retires after going 0-7 last night
I still don't understand how anyone in their right mind thought signing JR Smith was a good idea after watching him play in NY.
He plays lights out amazing until the finals.  He just fucking disappears.  I have no idea what his deal is.
Better defense is part of it. They aren't passing the ball like they were earlier in the playoffs also which helps the role players more.
GM LeBron needed a soft ass 3-point specialist, Mike Miller retired, so he got J.R. Smith.
GM LeBron only brings in players who he can take cool Instagram pics with.
Mike Miller was actually on Denver this year, but your point is still valid.
>Mike Miller is alive! He's in Denver, Colorado. He's in his late thirties.
JR has always been fool's gold when it counts.
This makes me happy 
lmao knicks fans 
Made me happy when they lost last year too
Firing Blatt and repalcing him with Lue is really rasing some questions right now... Because he is getting outcoached by a mile and the team looks way less prepred than last year 
Honestly I don't know. To me this series hasn't looked at all like the Cavs are getting outcoached. Personally, I think the Warriors are just a far superior team, the Cavs just need to play perfect and the Warriors need to play bad for them to win.
Lue is horrible... You look at the comparison on offense playcalling and movement and it's just not even close. Then you look at the rotations and matchups and it's even worse.
This reminds me of how Coach Thorpe said on Zach Lowe's podcast that he thinks they should've kept Blatt so they had a scapegoat in case they get beaten bad in the Finals.
To be fair that may just speak to Kerr's goodness
Warriors goodness in general. Thwyre just a nightmare matchup for the cavs. With that said , lue has definitely put out some weak rotations 
looks a lot like the warriors under jackson
Kerr\'s first question: "So where do you keep your Steph Curry?"
While I agree with this sentiment, it's hilarious how before this series started, all the top voted comments were about how Lue was getting this Cavs team to play way better than Blatt ever did. 2 losses later and the bandwagon is completely in the other camp.
I also loved how people were using the Cavs performance in the east as a reason as to why they'd be able to go toe to toe with the warriors. 
reddit would never flip flop on an opinioin.  Never I say!
Or maybe reddit is composed of people with different opinions.
Things that are highly upvoted do tend to speak for the community though.
There is a lot of flip flopping going on here. A week ago this was the best team Lebron has ever been on. Now he has no help and has to do everything himself.
Well that's basically what is said every playoff series Lebron's team loses/is losing in.
Has there ever been a team ever, pro or otherwise, that won a championship the same year they fired a coach?  I ask this knowing that there could very well be, I honestly have no idea, but I would be surprised if there were.\n\n*to add to this, has a team that ever fired a coach made the final round of whatever tournament they play?  I can't even think of that example.
> Has there ever been a team ever, pro or otherwise, that won a championship the same year they fired a coach?\n\nThere's at least 2 in soccer that won the Champions League, Zidane did it with Real Madrid this year, and Roberto di Matteo coached Chelsea in 2012 - that one was similar to Lue actually, started out as the assistant and got promoted to head coach after they fired the previous guy.
I think the Lakers did with Pat Riley in '82
How about the Heat in '06 with Pat Riley firing SVG and taking over?\n
Pittsburgh Penguins won the 2009 Stanley Cup the same season their head coach was fired. 
They're two wins away from doing it again this year. 
Damn. Knew they were two wins away, but didn't realize they had fired their coach this year. Must be the secret to their success?
I feel like Lue should have been the coach last year and Blatt this year.\n\nLue has made everyone get along and trust each other. Blatt couldnt. But now that theyre all friends, you need Blatts tactical ability.
Or maybe noone should be fired and they work together as a decent coaching staff should 
Lebron doesn't like to be coached. 
fuck you r/nba -Draymond Green
I believe it's called ''Trying to score''.

I can't fucking wait. 
Kevin Love has never lost a playoff game on the east coast where he hasn't had a concussion 
These are still funny tbh
A reddit post made here a few days ago that claimed Kevin Love has never lost a playoff game in the US, because they were against the Raptors.
Which itself was in response to a post before they lost to the Raptors saying Kevin Love was undefeated in the playoffs.
so the 2016 finals is Thunders vs Warriors right?> 
Thunder would have easily beat this Cavs team
We match up a lot better against OKC than against GSW.  That series would be more competitive than you think.
could you win though?
Instead of a 30pt blowout it would be a 29pt blowout 
I think it just got less exciting once the Thunder were eliminated. Rooting for the Cavs just doesn't really make sense (as a non-cavs fan), even though they have yet to have won a championship.\n\nI think Cavs will fight a bit, maybe win a game, but really this series was kinda over as soon as GSW won the conference finals. The Cavs team relies pretty heavily on LeBron to do most of the work while others just stand around or rebound.
I was under the impression that the Cavs were some transformed, small ball jump shooting team and would give the Warriors hell. I was even worried about that because all the "analysts" were saying the previous matchups don\'t even matter because this revitalized team was so good. \n\nHonestly last year\'s depleted Cav\'s team made the finals a hell of a lot more competitive.
That would be nice if they rebounded
Curry outrebounded Lebron.

[David Blatt watching like](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CWbWhn0W4AAf6_N.jpg)
I suspect almost every team without a head coach right now to try their best to hire Blatt, this series makes you appreciate the offense that Blatt implemented to make the players around LeBron better
Sadly, no. He\'s taken a job in Turkey, after waiting and getting no interest in the NBA. [Article](http://www.cleveland.com/pluto/index.ssf/2016/06/cleveland_cavaliers_have_terry_54.html). But I bet he\'s awfully satisfied tonight...or whenever morning is in Turkey.\n\nSad for the Cavs, the whole situation. Granted, a good bit of blame may be on him for "losing the team." But he had proven, elite level, coaching knowledge. Something Lue seemingly, and fittingly, doesn\'t have as a first year coach.
Rather unfortunate for Blatt, his basketball IQ level was severely unappreciated. As a Knick fan, I wanted him as the head coach (happy with the Horny situation we have ;)). Having LeBron on your team causes most sports fans and analysts to downplay your importance as a coach, best of luck to Blatt
After they fired him I remember thinking "I hope this bites them" feeling pretty vindicated. \n\nAlso Lakers fan here so obglitory "Fuck Dan Gilbert"
This dude had the Cavs up 2-1 in last years finals having Love and Irving physically absent due to injuries.....and they fired him
Seriously, that contract for Lue is looking incredibly foolish right now.\n\nEdit: I guess he didn't sign the contract? Still, Lue does not seem like the upgrade over Blatt he was made out to be.
As far as I'm concerned, the NBA Finals we're fantastic this year, and they ended last week. 
The whole fiasco surrounded Blatt and Lue is looking foolish. It looked ok earlier in the playoffs but only because it's the east. It's like the 2nd grade bully beat up all the newborn babies in the hospital, then to be king of the school yard, he has to fight against Kimbo Slice. 
Kobe would birth kids right into a pit of actual mambas if it got him a sixth ring. 
I didn't know who Kimbo Slice was and just looked him up. Holy shit. He probably gets free guacamole at Chipotle 
Lmao what
I mean would you tell Kimbo no if he asked for some guac?
Kimbo-"I\'ll have some guacamole too"\n\nChipotle guy-"That\'ll be extra....free"
What did you expect from Cleveland after giving Mike Brown 3 contracts?
Hey, let's give them some credit. This is the franchise that fired Mike Brown three times.
Hahaha... Oh I know... I know... *sobbing uncontrollably*
I haven't felt good about the Cavs since the Blatt firing. Normally the universe seems to screw Cleveland, but if the Cavs get swept I'm going to feel as though it was the Cavs who screwed the Cavs. Karma in sports has always seemed like a real thing to me.
Firing Blatt after one year and expecting immediate success from Lue, who has no head coaching experience at any level to his name to my knowledge, is such a Browns thing to do. What did Cleveland area professional sports ever do to anger the sports gods? God save Francona. 
That is a very mature response. The Cav's did not handle that situation well. 
The thing that blew my mind about the situation was that Lue didn't become just an interim, he legitimately became the replacement with a god damn 3 year contract. That's just incredibly foolish to me. There's very little to gain and a lot to lose. A wise organization (although it's kind of contradictory as that type of organization wouldn't fire Blatt midseason) would have just seen how Lue finished out the season and then reevaluate. I guess Gilbert really doesn't care about burning money. 
Not three years. \n\nhttp://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/id/15430004/tyronn-lue-cleveland-cavaliers-sign-new-contract-taking-david-blatt-head-coach
>A wise organization\n\nCleveland.... Does not compute....

That would be perfect. 
I fucking pray for this
/r/nba would collapse under the weight of its own salt
/r/nba would never be the same
Draymond Green is a very controversial player. He plays pretty physically and tends to complain to the refs a lot. He makes some dirty plays, but /r/nba fucking hates him and thinks he's hitler or some shit.\n\nSo yeah /r/nba fuckin hates him and gets angry when he does well, finals mvp would drive this place crazy
At least it's not lebron 
At this point, the only way Lebron is going to get one for The Land is if he clones himself 14 times.
Lmao I just imagined a team of 15 lebrons and smiled for the first time all night 
Who's going to play the 4th then?
No outside shooting to spread the floor
Obviously you are being sarcastic, but 14 lebrons would tear apart GS. Lebron is always incredibly exhuasted from being the #1 option under extreme pressure and volume. Have 15 Lebrons are all well rested and dont have to shoulder the load. So much passing, basketball Iq, raw athleticism size and talent on one team... No one stands a chance against it
I feel like one Lebron would still try to run everything instead of just taking turns. Also the spacing would be even worse than he has it now.
Ok. 14 Lebrons vs 14 Curry's. Who wins? 
LeBron can defend curry far better than curry can LeBron. Adv Lebrondas
Would you rather fight 2 curry-sized Lebrons or 1 LeBron-sized curry?
Shhhhh. You are wasting precious internet gold for the offseason. Hold onto that question for another 2 months my child. Then reap the rewards.  
I can't believe OKC died for this.
> But seriously... I can respect Steph Curry\'s skill, but the kid schtick wears a little thin. He carries himself like a 17 year old\n\nSo he has a "kid schtick" because he likes to have fun and celebrate? Fuck that. I love that about Curry. Makes the sport more entertaining to watch. 
Oh r/nba you just keep being you.
You must save a lot of money never having to buy salt
It was mostly OKC's fault for having the biggest choke of their entire franchise. Seriously, when you have a 3-1 lead, you wanna close it out as soon as possible. Maybe we could excuse them for losing Game 5, but they  never really did adjust properly. I really really wanted OKC to go to the finals and at least compete with the Cavs, as a non-OKC fan. Maybe when he wins a championship in OKC, people will stop debating about LeBron vs. KD stuff. \n\nI guess it could be good if KD stays. This is a new coach, and most of the players were healthy this season, which tells me that they have room to grow and even could be better than last season. LeBron when he came to the Heat also lost in his first season as well, so maybe he has a better chance at staying in OKC than to go anywhere else. But i guess it's up to him to decide about all of this.
Kyrie\'s like "Bruh ain\'t nobody ask you to come play with us" http://i.imgur.com/2OisMjt.jpg

float like a butterfly sting like a kick in the balls
Iggy's suffering for Draymond's sins
At this point, LeBron would be lucky to get one win for the Land
Is that what he really meant when he said he was going to win one for the Land
The Cavs were clearly outmatched but I blame this loss ~~solely~~ mostly on Lue. The Cavs had a chance in that third quarter but he puts LeBron at the 5. The Warriors went on a 13-4 run against that lineup but he doesn't make any adjustment whatsoever. He kept on playing LeBron for the entire third quarter and that means LeBron can't start the 4th quarter like usual (and instead Lue puts in Mozgov) - and we know what happened at the start of the 4th quarter.
Can't blame this on Lue -- his plays worked. Delly, JR, Kyrie, Love -- where are the Cavs shooters? Why is LeBron taking the most threes? And forget the start of the 4th -- the lead was 20 heading into the 4th -- Lue is a great coach but the Cavs team isn't confident enough to hit the shots they need to hit
This Cavs team looks shook. It's one thing to be 0-2, and another when they aren't even competing out there.\n\nI don't think blowing out the eastern conference did them any favors. I'm not sure they really know how to respond to adversity. They just ran into a brick wall.
You mean that play where he tells his max deal stretch four to go sit in the corner?
Fuck that. Cavs haven't had a chance since this series started. They have to work so fucking hard to get a contested layup, while GSW just runs off ball screens looking for easy backdoors and open shots. GSW would have to suddenly get legendary bad at hitting open shots to lose a game this series. 
Solely?
yeah maybe got solely. got too excited
Lue is legit embarrassing but Lebron got his boy the head coaching gig like he wanted..
Not just Lue, but every player not named LeBron or Jefferson. Nobody showed up, nobody bothered to even try
What did LeBron do? He was terrible too... RJ the only guy who showed up
He actually tried. Put effort into at least doing SOMETHING
At least 2 of Lebron's TOs were due to someone just not catching a simple pass.
That's true, can't say that dude doesn't care
Why does this seem to happen every finals with LeBron?  It feels like the pressure is so high and people rely more and more on LeBron telling them what to do so they don't fail or something.  I'm not a huge LeBron fan,  but I do feel bad and that his team sure fails him when he needs them most. Old man Ray Allen was the only one helping him his 4th year in the heat. 
Partly because Lebron *is* just so dominant - it's easier to take shots or drive and miss when you didn't have Lebron has an option to go to and turn down.
Hey now, JR dove after a loose ball one time.
Kyrie fumbled about 25 passes I think
60 or 70 turnovers IIRC
Remember when people used to give Bosh a hard time about nervousness and all that? Kyrie makes him look like a stone cold crunch time big game murderer.
Bosh hit hella clutch 3s. Kylie ain't done shit besides that one regular season game against the Spurs.
Bosh was instrumental in one of the biggest plays in NBA history. I don't think anyone can knock his clutch gene.
Yeah but Bosh has been clutch in the biggest moments. Bosh can actually play defense too.
> Bosh can actually play defense too. \n\nThis x 100. People tend to forget why the Heat were so good. LeBron and Wade were elite defenders, and if any of the other 3 players on the floor even gave half of a shit, the defense would be great. This cavs team plays shit perimeter defense. 
LeBron is now 9-1 following a Game 1 loss. RIP another irrelevant stat.
9-2. Got swept by the Spurs in '07. He was 9 straight after that. 
There GS goes again, breaking records.
The Warriors are the first team since the 96 Bulls to break another team\'s Game 2 undefeated streak. - ESPN intern hoping no one tries to fact check him
Cleveland gain the lead\n\nLose the lead\n\nStart losing by 10\n\nNow 20\n\nCleveland sports in a nutshell\n
Cleveland favored to win the finals before the season, smash the east, get rekt in four. 
>Now 30\n\nI want to say that's GSW's MO too, but 33 is a bit extreme, even for them.
So to beat the Warriors, you need a big man who can score inside and defend, and wings who can disrupt GS passing. You basically need a team of MONSTARS with insane length and athleticism.\n\nOKC was close enough and made them look human
So the Celtics with an entirely different roster.
Whiteside!
Dwight and Aldridge can get buckets and play some defense. 
If KD stays I think they have a real shot to knock them off next year barring injury.
You could say you had a real shot this year too
They had 3 shots
7 even 
Biggest L of the night is Shumpert's hair

Deflated?
It's like the Warriors are trying to figure out how many different ways they can beat the Cavs without Steph and Klay having to make any substantial contributions. 
I don't get why everybody is so concerned. The Cavs slowed down the Warriors bench, which only put up 44 points. 
Held Barbosa to 5/6 instead of 5/5.

lebron pulled a regular season curry, didnt bother playing in the 4th.
is there anything funnier than a wooosh that is a woooosh... its wooshception
It's the only way he doesn't have to play the 4th, when they're losing handily. 
no clutch gene smh
Curry pulled a curry and didn't even play 30 minutes
In hindsight, building a Big 3 with two defensive liabilities like Love and Kyrie might not have been the best idea. They need to be averaging 20 a night each to justify their spots on the floor, and they haven't come close these finals.\n\nLebron the player is amazing. Lebron the GM has been a disaster.
It was 100% Lebron's decision to trade for Love. His agent also held the Cavs hostage to give Thompson a massive contract. And by all indications Blatt was gone because Lebron wanted him gone.\n\nLebron's my favorite player in the league so I'm not saying this from a place of hate, but this is the team he wanted constructed.
The reason the cavs were unwilling to commit to giving up Wiggins was because they were not sure what Lebron was going to do. Once he signed he took over. What's hard to understand. 
does that sound realistic at all? why would cavs okay that trade if there was no belief that klove would re-sign after the contract was over? only reason was because lebron brokered the trade
>Lebron the player is amazing. Lebron the GM has been a disaster.\n\nStill following in Jordan's footsteps I see.
OKC vs. GS really was the finals.

This series is everything Dan Gilbert deserves.
I normally would love to see a competitive series but I'd love to see a sweep just because it'd mean another year that shit head doesn't win a title. 
It would be much sweeter if they don't make the finals with that salary heavy roster but this will do.
fuck Dan Gilbert so hard. 
Look,  we don't want to be here.
call me bitter, but lebron too. If not for anything other than going back to that jerk off, who publically humilated him, and after he came down to us and got his only two rings. 
When Richard Jefferson is your second best player on the floor, you have a problem. 
Props to him for the effort though 
I think /r/nba owes the refs an apology
I just think they're bad all around.  It's not like they cost the Cavs the game, they did that very well on their own.
Cavs shot 14 more free throws, Curry was in foul trouble, and the Cavs still lost by 33... What favored the Warriors?
There always has to be a villain for r/nba to thrash and circlejerk to death. It was Draymond last week and its the Cavs now. And if you think you can go against the grain with something objective, youre mistaken.
Oh it was Draymond for more than a week lol.  Are people viewing the Cavs as villains?  I'm getting the vibe that people just view them as garbage and even saw some comments from GS fans saying they feel bad for the Cavs haha.  
Which shouldnt be controversial if you saw the game, have two eyes and a brain. But it is what it is. Never lose objectivity for the threat of losing fake internet points.
Oh definitely, I assume most people don't really care about being downvoted.
If you watch the replay in real time, that foul was very easy to miss.  Everyone I was watching with didn't realize Love got fouled until we saw him on the floor.  It makes sense because the refs were keeping track of so many things on that rebound.
Cavs FTA advantage 24-10.
on behalf of /r/nba I apologize to Scott Foster, Tony Brothers. They did a good job of swallowing their whistles, called some surprising travels and even some moving screens! 
The moving screens on Mozgov were so weak. Other than that and a few other missed call it was a pretty good game by the refs.
Yeah what the fuck I thought Lebron's crab dribbles were written into the rules at this point with how many times they let it go
both times it looked like improperly executed jump stops, he skipped to his lou instead of landing on both feet. 
I think he should have just skipped Lou all together...
They totally faked us out. 
They called back to back travels on *Lebron*. I've never seen that kinda shit in my life.
And completely ignored Love getting domed by an elbow.
They called only 1 on him the entire series against the Raps, and he was travelling anywhere from 4-6 times every game. Not like it would've made a huge difference in our series anyways, but so satisfying to see him finally get called for that junk. 
That was a goddamn *statement* and it was kind of glorious.
yeah at that point I couldnt even conjure words of shock.
Observations:\n\nTurning point - 3rd quarter when Steph goes out with his 4th foul and the Warriors (instead of maintaining a single digit lead) grow it to 20 entering the fourth\n\nMost surprising part of the game - refs weren't that bad\n\nFinal thought - how about Bogut setting the pace defensively early with those 4 blocks in the first quarter?
Bogut is low key the Dub's X factor. During the OKC series it was Bogut's defense and playmaking that changed the game. 
He altered so many Russell and KD layups. I wouldnt be surprised if Bogut was the reason KD wasnt driving for layups in game 6
bogut is all about the unrecorded stat of altered shots
Nothing like ending the NBA season with a few exhibition games
Only won by 33\n\nNot impressed
Blatt: 30-11 without Kyrie for large stretch, went 4-2 in Finals previous season without Love and Kyrie\n\nLue: 27-14 with a healthy squad, lose first 2 games of Finals in blowouts
I think the WNBA finals are more exciting than this one
Tyronn Lue about to get fired mid-Finals
[Remember when Ty Lue was supposed to take the Cavs all the way?](http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/457e3325b60a55fc3554ffed6f81eeb52a008135/c=373-179-2244-1584&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/USATODAY/USATODAY/2014/07/13/1405283674000-USP-NBA-Cleveland-Cavaliers-Press-Conference.jpg)
In Europe so he can get his full contract from the cavs
It just amazes me how the Warriors are having their way with the Cavs without Curry having any dominant performances. As a basketball fan, I just hope to see a competitive series.
Re-watch the OKC series
That was the thing that's stuck out. Neither of the Warrior's best scorers have had a game of 20+ points yet and they're still dominating this series. Cleveland players have gotten a bit shell shocked. It was the same for a ot of the Warriors the first 2-3 games last year though so let's not count the cavs out just yet. I don't expect Lebron to just sit and watch another championship slip down the drain
thats what happens when every player on the warriors is better than their opposition other than lebron
I don't know how many games it would take the Cavs to beat the Warriors 4 times but it sure as shit isn't 5 games. 
I'm not sure you do. He is saying that the Warriors can likely beat the Cavs 4 times out of 5 games. It may take the Cavs 12-16 games to win 4 of them. 
There's only 5 games left in this series. 
Ahh.  I see.  NM.  :)
Let's go ahead and say it.\n\nBest NBA teams:\n\n1. Warriors\n\n2. Thunder\n\n3. Spurs \n\n4. Cavs
Clippers?
No good Clippers
We made it
The Celtics, Bucks, Timberwolves, Nuggets, Spurs, Pistons, Blazers, Mavericks, Thunder, and the fucking 17-65 Lakers beat the Warriors this year.\n\nLelbron.\n\nEdit: Forgot the Rockets, sorry /u/VernonMaxwell
1. Warriors\n2. Thunder\n3. Warriors Bench\n4. Spurs\n5. Cavs
no way our bench beats Spurs.....
Hows this?\n\n1. Warriors\n2. Thunder\n3. Spurs\n4. Warriors Bench\n5. Cavs\n\nCavs top 5!!
Yay *sobs*
Honestly the Warriors struggled more against Portland than they are against the cavs right now.
Probably because we didn't have Curry. The game we lost was also not in Oracle.
Healthy Clips at 5 and honestly a decent argument for 4
This is the most boring finals I have seen in my lifetime (so far, it's only 2 games though, things can change) and I've seen the Spurs in the Finals many times.
I mean... hopefully it goes something more like that series but we're talking 73-9 vs. rookie head coach and Richard Jefferson here.
This is beautiful in a basketball point of view because of how GSW is playing, but entertaining? Hell nah.
Game needs to be close to close to be entertaining. 
Spurs have been involved in some incredible finals basketball, the Cavs one being the most boring.
That OKC series though...
It was nice. That doesn't make up for this series. Yuck. I really hope the Cavs make SOMETHING out of it but, there is just no hope in sight right now.  
> I really hope the Cavs make SOMETHING out of it\n\nI could see game 3 being really down to the wire in which case a Warriors win would totally break Cleveland and then they just walk through game 4 for the sweep.
Watching this series must be awful for the Thunder
Just about every western conference team I bet. spurs wishing they could've been in the east too.
Like a 49er fan watching the Seahawks bend Denver over.
Those playoffs hurt my soul as a 9er fan. First we lose Bowman to a gruesome injury on National TV which they replayed more than enough times then they lose in a last chance interception. To make it even worse it was done by the most hateable player on their team. Two weeks pass by and you just see Denver bendover for the whole world to see.\n\n\n\nEdit: i also get sad when i realize that that was the last game both Bo and Pat played together.
[Goddamn it](http://larrybrownsports.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/steve-kerr-clipboard.jpg)
The Thunder and Warriors were playing at such a high level and playing so focused and hard it's no wonder why the Warriors are beating ass. Cleveland never had to dig in and earn it. I am confident had the Thunder advanced it would still be the same story.
Absolutely. I'm honestly surprised by these games. I really wanted this to be a good series. Hopefully they turn it around at home. But right now it looks like the WCF was the real finals
This finals has been really dissapointing from an entertainment stand point.
Honestly. I hated you guys. But I respect you guys.  All I said that entire time during and leading up to that series was how scary you guys are. I'm so glad we survived you lol. But you guys would have done the same if not worse to the cavs
I can say from these two Finals games, the only thing my friends and I have been talking about is how the Thunder series steeled the Warriors for the Cavs.  Compared to OKC, Cleveland looks like they're a bunch of 5 foot tall boys playing in slow motion.  It's amazing.  The fact that I saw passes into the paint for wide open dunks/layups was utterly shocking to me.  It's something we haven't seen the Warriors do in two weeks because we haven't been able to do it in two weeks.  The Thunder would absolutely murk this Cavaliers team. 
can you IMAGINE what Russ would do to Irving?? 
Honestly, Irving would never guard Russ. They'd hide him on Roberson and let JR guard Russ. Love would be all right on Ibaka or Adams, too. \n\nThe problem with the Warriors is that all of their players are offensive weapons and they move the ball really well, so the Cavs can't hide their bad defenders. The Thunder would still have been the favorites, but they would have been a much better matchup for the Cavs. 
Lol @ Cavs fans complaining about calls in a 33 point blow out

Shumps hair was shook
Absolutely pathetic showing by everyone on the Cavs not named LeBron or Jefferson. This series was already going to be an uphill battle for them against an improved Warriors team but LeBron is absolutely helpless with Irving playing horrible and literally no one else is giving any effort.\n\nLiterally one of the worst team performances I have ever seen in a finals, LeBron was the only player on the Cavs even trying to win the game. Absolutely disgusting, James and Cavs fans have to be super disappointed in this team and the effort they gave tonight.\n\nJames needs to leave after this year, sorry Cavs fans but he can't  do it by himself.\n\nedit: since a lot of people seem to be getting confused, I am not saying that they don't have talent, I am saying that all the talent in the world doesn't matter if they go out there and don't even try. Talent still requires effort to be effective.\n\nJR Smith has played 69min in 2 games so far, he has attempted 9 shots and made 3. Sixty. Nine. Minutes. And has only shot the ball NINE times.\n\nWhen L James scores 19pts w/ 8 turnovers and was still the best player on the Cavs by a large margin...thats really not good.
JR is only getting touches with a defender already set on him which causes him to create his own shot. He's best at the catch and shoot which seems to have disappeared from the playbook. 
Why does LeBron always get a pass?  \n\nHe's playing like ass. 
God I swear you people who live by stats...\n\nDID YOU WATCH THE GAME?\n\nDid you see the part where he was practically useless? Zero finesse. Zero offensive versatility. Zero footwork. Zero post game. Dumb decisions. Bad passes. Bad shots. \n\nIsn't his whole M.O. that he makes his teammates better?\n\nHowever you look at it he played terrible. \n
Must have watched a different game, when no one on the cavs moves without the ball not much lebron can do if everyone on his team stands around and watches him.
When others get the ball he just stands around, as well. He needs to be held accountable too. 
He's supposed to be a top 5 player of all time. He's supposed to be transcendent.\n\n19 points on 7/17 shooting with 7 TO's isn't good enough. I don't care if he almost got a triple double.
You realize that 3 of those were passes that went straight through his teammates hands?\n\nWhen no one on your team hits any shots, plays any defense, or spaces the floor properly, it's really hard to be amazing all by yourself against a terrific defensive team.
He\'s supposed to be running an offense and telling them where to go. By his own admission, he\'s the "offensive coordinator".  But instead he tries to iso freight train into some of the best wing defenders in the league. LeBron is getting outsmarted by the Warriors defense, and instead of trying new things, he sticks with what doesn\'t work.
Because everyone just reads stats and says 'oh he's putting up x numbers so he can't be the problem'. But pts/rbs/ast only tell so much. 
The classic "Lebron needs more help!!!" comment that has been going on every time Lebron loses a series, except in 2011 when he was the one who played bad. \n\n\nEither way it\'s hard for him to find a more talented roster to go to than this Cavs team, even if they underperforming in the finals. Where\'s he going to go that\'s better than the Cavs talent-wise? 
the Warriors?
>Where's he going to go that's better than the Cavs talent-wise?\n\nI'd give LeBron better odds to win a finals with about 5 teams in the west and possibly Toronto in the East. \n\nPut LeBron at the wing in Toronto and that would be a NASTY line up.\n
warriors clippers spurs okc 
Ill bet all my marbles lebron is gonna stay in the east. He knows its not a sure shot to the finals each year in the west
I really think the Cavs bought into their own hype way too hard. The Warriors did that in the WCF and it nearly bit them hard. Now they ain't fucking around. But Cleveland had too easy of a time. They walked into the rematch feeling themselves because they only lost twice and last year was a fluke because health and this year they're way better. Then they got punched in the mouth, and I don't see any sort of poise. I hope, for the sake of my own entertainment, that the Cavs get their shit together and play like a team that's playing in the damn Finals.
woah. what about richard jefferson?
I don't watch much basketball and I was like holy shit, I remember him from when I was like 12 years old, is that Richard Jefferson? 
Richard Jefferson doesn't deserve to be lumped in with the rest of the Cavs. He's been playing better than Lue could have hoped. As for everyone else though....
I ninja edited Jefferson in there, yall are quick
Cavs: "Here\'s the team you wanted LeBron" \n\nLeBron: "This team sucks, I\'m out" 
Please take tt with you when you go. It's what you wanted after all. 
Talent doesn't matter when they don't show up
Damn Bay Area looks nice as hell...probably expensive as shit
Everyone makes a lot of money around here so yeah, that's the cost of living. I'm in SF right now, it's a little bit more pricey than the North Bay where I'm from, but with a $13/hr min wage as the baseline, it doesn't take much to make some money.
yeah but at $13 an hour you are probably living in the ghetto
Yep, $13 gets you jack in the bay. Hell, i got paid $18/hr working at an apple store for a little before i got into grad school and that barely helped either.\n\nNow, I'm in nowheresville Virginia where a house cost here as much as a 1bd apartment 30 minutes outside of San Francisco...\n
#im just here for the memes
The Warriors are so fucking ridiculous that they're making people go nuts. I have a friend that serious thinks that the Warriors made their entire court and the baskets a giant electromagnet to force the ball to make shots. Congrats Warriors, you made a sane man become insane.
It's easier just to install a rim-rattling device like the Thunder did...

**L**
He looked so sad sitting the fourth. I loved it 
i did for a second when they showed that zoominn at the beginning of the 4^th. then i had my daily flashbacks of the 2007 ECF G5 Cavs vs Pistons. and then i just smiled. justice is being served. thank you gsw. thx dray.
yeah I feel sorry for Dan Gilbert. jk fuck him.
Its his 110 million, he can chose any way he wants to burn it. I'm enjoying his choices.
You do remember his Comic Sans letter, right?

Just want to remind everyone that this is the team Lebron wanted, with the coach he wanted, with the players he wanted- who are all healthy.
Toucher & Rich is that you?
Yes. That's why. Screw him.
why?
> this is the team Lebron wanted, with the coach he wanted, with the players he wanted- who are all healthy.
But why is that reason to hate him?
It is when you're a little bitch about what coach you want and shit on players you don't hand pick
He ran a coach out of town for starters.
I feel like going out of your way to get a successful person fired so you can have your friend take that guys place is a little more than petty.
Especially since the new guy is not a good coach. \n\nI love LeBron, adore that dude, but the whole Blatt thing is complete bullshit 
Because he always beats my team
Fair.
Because a player having influence over the team is the worst thing in the world, I guess.
It's because he's trying to do things that aren't his job. It's the same reason people hate ball hogs.\n\nLeBron's job is to play basketball. It's not his job to coach, and it's not his job to be the GM. Instead he's taken over the team because he knows the Cavs organization needs him, but he ends up just ruining his own chances by doing jobs he's not qualifies for. 
No not at all, I think it's deserved especially when you're as good/valuable as LeBron.  But it definitely also means you'll get criticism if that team you had influence on creating gets fucking pounded in the Finals.
True, but in their defense they are getting pounded by one of the best teams in NBA history.
I love how this narrative has changed in a weeks time. Last week people though they sucked down 3-1, now since CLE is in a huge deficit, they're great (which they are). 
A lot of that is just that when things aren't going well the haters get louder and the supporters get quieter.  Then when things are going well the supporters get louder and the haters get quieter.  It's not so much that people are actually flip flopping that violently.
I think this just goes to show you how good the Thunder were playing. Everyone knew the Spurs and Warriors were really good. The fact that the Thunder beat one and could compete with the other is a credit to them. The fact that the Cavs haven't shown they can means, well, they are either not as good as we thought or heavily under-achieving.

East is weak shit. Spurs and thunder could have taken it to this Cavs team as well. 
##THAT'S WHY!
I like it because it gives more value to the heat organization 
Pat Riley comes out an unsurprising winner in all of this, IMO
Well Love was out half of this game that's why they lost by 34 and not 44. So he has that going for him.
Well, he didn't expect them to play like trash.
Except they aren't. I'd still take OKC and the Spurs in a series over them. The West is on a whole other level this year. \n\nThis is a team that won only 57 games in a weak conference. We're talking about 2 historically great regular season teams in the West and another that took one of them down and had the other on the ropes 3-1. All 3 teams would've crushed Cleveland IMO. 
Yeah its the same with everyone blaming Lue. The fact is GS is a way better team, and for the Cavs to win they need to play almost perfect and GS needs to play bad.
Yeah poor Lebron never has a good supporting cast\n\n\\s
Isn't Lebron's whole shtick that he makes his teammates better?
But hes also playing with Kyrie Irving who has the opposite effect 
I really like Lebron's game and he usually does that. He seriously puts everyone in the best possible position to score but tonight he made sloppy passes ocassionally, Kyrie actually dropped a number of his passes and then the rest of them just couldn't convert. There's only so much one man can do and even then he makes mistakes. Lebron James is actually a human being, shocking as it may be to some 
only when it's convenient
He can't play 1 on 1 defense for them or box out their man for them. Also, how many dropped passes did his teammates have tonight? I remember at least three going right through their hands and out of bounds. 
LeBron himself hasn't been amazing, but the guys around him are just straight up awful.
there's nothing wrong with wanting those players, they just aren't performing, nobody can foresee that
True, but there's no longer an excuse for his supporting cast surrounding him. The talent is there and these are the guys he wanted.
No people just can\'t say "oh but if Love and Kyrie were healthy" or "look at his teammates, they\'re trash" or "David Blatt has no control". This entire team has LeBron\'s fingerprints on it. So I don\'t want to hear anymore excuses. Just go out there and win a game.
talent doesn\'t matter if the guys around you are playing scared.. i can put jordan, kobe and shaq with lebron and if they played like absolute shit then talent doesn\'t really matter.
Part of what made those players all-time greats is that they never just didn't show up, never played scared, never played like absolute shit. Irving and Love clearly don't have that same fire. Not that anyone should shit on them for not being at the level of Jordan Kobe or Shaq, but part of the point is they aren't showing up in the Finals... where when you win you get to be the champions, you're so close there are no excuses for not giving it your all. \n\nI think they are just super demoralized because they can see they're so overmatched, up and down the rosters and the coaching staffs. Coaching is huge in the playoffs, and they don't even have a real coach. 
Problem is they literally aren't even trying. It's not like he picked garbage players to surround himself with, these guys just aren't showing up this series
A lot of people thought that this would not be as close of a series. They are not good defenders and the Warriors defense can just switch everything and still contest. A lot of people were saying these things, so I think it was foreseeable
I was mainly talking about this year. But even still, there's a tendency for fans and players to rate a player based on old traditional stats, which love and Irving looked great on. But when you look at their defense and you look at how they do when they aren't primary ball handlers, it changes a bit. I was making the point last year that they might have actually had a better chance without love/Irving because it forced them to play a slower style and gave them a stronger defense (with maybe an offset in a less effective offense, but I'd argue net net was positive)
> nobody can foresee that\n\nHow about the people who disagreed with what Lebron wanted and were subsequently forced out of the Cavs organization? Pretty sure they foresaw it.
> That kyrie and Klove have no heart?\n\nIs this First Take or are we actually gonna talk about the weaknesses of this Cavs team?
True but this is what happens when you build a team so top heavy. Lebron loves his big 3's but 3 max contracts seriously hinders your ability to put together a deep and reliable roster. And if any of your big 3 have off games, as we saw tonight, you have no chance.
NO TEAM can ever expect to be as deep as the warriors are, they won the most games in a season for a reason. Dan gilbert was also perfectly fine with paying salary tax so max contracts aren't nearly as big of a deal. I agree that it hurts depth a bit but cmon lets be real, it's hard to get it as right as the warriors organization has gotten it in the past 6 years. And 2 rings is what they'll have to show for it, rightfully so. They just have better players and harder working players 
this thread is about 30 minutes late
30 minutes?  That's a bit generous.
About half a game late
It must be really rough to be a OKC fan, to lose a 3-1 lead in the NBA finals. That must be devastating.
Yeah because he beat him one time in the finals. 
Hes saying the WCF was essentially the finals 
yes, the wcf were the real finals and playing the cavs is just a formality
I don't even want to joke about other teams choking just because of 4-1
Lebron should've never left Miami. At least Wade and Bosh looked like they gave a shit on D. 
He wanted more control in the organization and a younger team. He made the right decision but you can't deny that Wade and Bosh wanted it more and it showed on the court.

I\'ve seen a lot of people say, the cavs needed to stop doubling Steph and let him shoot all he wants because "he\'s not good enough to beat you on his own".\n\nAm I taking crazy pills or does that sound like a terrible idea
Well I hope they do that, it would be fun to see Steph get some easier looks and go off on one of his explosions. 
Hey KD, it\'s me LeBron. Sorry to call you so late on a Sunday, but I was just wondering... what are you doing next year??
[Y'all ready for Game 3?](https://media.giphy.com/media/PuHp0vHXEGbUQ/giphy.gif)
The CAVS forgot to show up for the game tonight. Blatt anyone?
Klay  could go scoreless for the rest of the series and the dubs would still owe him everything. \n\nGame 6 of WCF was unreal.
All the talk should not just be about Steph and Klay.  This is a complete team.  They are like a better version of the last Spurs championship squad.  That steal by Barbosa at the start of the 4th signifies all this team is about.  They try harder and play more unselfish.  No hero ball needed.  
apology for poor english\n\nwhere were you when /r/nba  dies?\n\ni was sat at home drinking salty tears\n\n'lebron is kill'\n\n'no'
Ummmmmmmm
...Should we tell him?

I just wanna go back to all the fuckDray threads and talk shit but I promised God I would never sin again if we got out of the WCFs so I can't \xf0\x9f\x98\xa9
Oh lord it might actually happen hahaha
so far, I'd say he's the favorite.
No doubt.  Livingston isn't going to get it and I don't think Andre will have enough on offense to repeat.  If Draymond puts up a triple double in game 3 or 4 I think he'll take it.  Klay/Steph still could if they pull one of their torch-fests though
Lol no way in hell.  If LeBron were going to win it, he would've won it last year when he absolutely destroyed.  He averaged 35.8 points, 13.3 rebounds, and 8.8 assists in the series, but they gave it to Iguodala anyway because he was on the winning team.  \n\nI think the voters just decided it's silly to have a member of the losing team waiting around with the champions to have a (somewhat) meaningless trophy presented to them after a crushing loss that sends them home.
That was how you defend home court in the finals like the defending NBA champs. Most memorable part for me?\n\nBACK-TO-BACK MOZGOV & IAN CLARK NBA FINALS APPEARANCES\n\n*downs entire pint of sub-premium vodka*

Committed 21 turnovers, won by 33. Wtf
Cavs shot 14 more FTs...
Yeah the refs were clearly helping the Cavs, it just wasn't close enough to matter this game. 
Nah man I think that guy really cracked the case here
And 14 less fts
fewer - Stannis
Hard to get fouled on wide open dunks
But muh no kyrie and no love\n\nCavs in 5\n\nEL\n\nOH\n\nEL\n\nCavs have the highest payroll in the league but they are still full of garbage players while the gs bench looks like all stars
It's all about getting my friend TT that massive contract.
So... How bout them Indians?
Giants/Indians WS please.
Don't do this to me. My heart can only handle so much 
I would die
why do people hate green so much? He played amazing today
Did Kristen Ledlow's boobs get bigger? She looked INCREDIBLE in that turtle neck
They sure as hell did. 
I'll take over when the belly grows. Have your fun for now.
Pic? 
So is it safe to say the Thunder were the second best team this season?
This post-season, and so far yes.
Possibility: Cavs might not ever win a Championship while having LeBron. Twice.
I kind of wanted them to win one in Lebron's first stint. Now? Please no. 
**THIS IS OKC'S FAULT**
Richard Jefferson had more points than Love and Kyrie, what's good with them Max deals 
Man Lebron is really taking all these questions in the post game interview so well. He is getting killed by the Warriors, but he is answering all these questions so well.

The Thunder died for this 
After complaining that RJ was the only one doing anything, I stopped watched after the 3rd. I was like "fuck this ill just go to bed." I knew it was over. \n\nI was about to eat an ice cream sandwich too and I just put that back in the freezer. \n\nSigh. 
Warriors are the better. Like what more do you want us to say ...
We love Draymond Green.
This comment is just straight up cruel and I absolutely love it. 
They are definitely the better. No doubt in my. 
I don't know about everyone else, but I want you to finish your first sentence.
After Game 1 Lebron said if you turn over the ball 15 times you're not beating anyone. \n\nTonight the Warriors had 20 TO and won by 33. 
There are people I this world who aren't affected emotionally by sports. How do I become one of those people?
Love under concussion protocol. This is bad news... for Golden State.
I wish the post game threads were actual discussion and jot who can make the funniest joke or meme.
I for one greatly enjoyed the Warriors vs Thunder NBA Finals. 
Can't believe I watched this shit instead of game of thrones lmao
Obviously the Warriors only won because Kevin Love got hurt..
It's official: The East is straight up garbage
This has been fact for a while. 
ITT: People salty about Draymond's showing\n\n\n^can't ^wait ^to ^see ^what ^happens ^when ^he's ^FMVP
Please no, my boat wouldn't be able to survive the salt damage.\n\nWarriors can commit the slaughter, but don't give Draymond that FMVP
Haven't seen a single person be salty about it. Just people talking about how people are being salty. 
The Dray haters only show up when we lose.
/r/nba would implode
Who was that woman Iggy was hitting on the entire 4th quarter?
The one he's waking up with tomorrow.
Iggy and that guy are gonna be her splash brothers.
Anyone got a clip for this?
With her husband sitting next to her holding her purse. 
Does this mean we get to see angry Lebron?
Is lebron regretting leaving the Heat? He would of coasted to the finals on either team.
Time to eliminate the conferences. I dont get the point of splitting the competition in half. I have no doubt that there are season were both conferences had equivalent teams when compared to each other but why not just do away with them and guarantee a great playoffs with a 1-16 seeded bracket?
So can we stop pretending like any other teams are close to Golden State's level right now? The series against the Thunder was an absolute worst case scenario (part of which was the Thunder playing really well, credit to them) but they still pulled it out. I was a bit too young to really judge the mid-90s Bulls as it was happening, but Golden State on the whole has been the best basketball team I've ever seen, and clearly so.

What if OKC played the rest of the series for Cleveland?
Warriors were down 1-3 to the Thunder and have now won 5 in a row (likely to be 7). Sucks to be Bron. Every time he makes it to the finals with the Cavs, he has to face an unbeatable monster.
9 -  1
Not one. Not two. Not three. But, four losses in The Finals. 
#CURRY LEADING REBOUNDER EVEN AFTER SITTING 3RD QUARTER
If Kyrie doesn't show some fire in game 3, and make his talents and presence felt, Cavs should just start the lineup that won them 2 games last year. This is a fucking joke. They need to play defense to win these games and they're simply getting pushed around. Warriors have been galvanized and are playing absolutely ferocious d, but on the offensive end they are wrecking shop inside and out. I expect Mozgov to get non-garbage time minutes in Game 3. If he does not, Lue is a fucking fraud and has no place coaching this team. Cavs need to play HUNGRY on defense. More tipped balls, more fifty fifty balls, more hard fouls, more forced turnovers, more blocked shots. I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure they have the personnel for those things. 
Your opponent has left the match\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/QfDXQo7.jpg
I've barely watched the NBA and don't know much about basketball, but from what I've watched, the Cavs have absolutely had their buttholes taken, and the Warriors will win in 4.
This game was a kick to the nuts for Draymond haters.\n\nI'll go...
Ok blow this team up it's time to tank for LeBron James Jr. and Bryce maximus.
Tbh the most exciting part of this game was watching Shumperts hair flop around.

Sooo, Lebron south beach is comfy
I don't want him back, man. Not with all the local media on their high horse, further cementing their insane belief that Miami gave LeBron those titles, not the other way around.\n\nWe've lost our LeBron privileges if he brings us two titles and we're so arrogant to think that it was Wade's bad knees and Bosh getting shut out in a Game 7 that did 
The amount of stats shitting on the Cavs for the next couple days is gonna be something else
Lue should hit up Blatt to see what he would do since he shouldn't of been fired in the first place.
If the Cavs had Dellavedova and Mozgov GSW would have no chance
WARRIORS IN 3
But the Cavaliers are healthy\n\nHow could this possibly be happening /s
Cavalier fans before series started: "We\'re healthy, the Warriors don\'t stand a chance!"\n\nCavalier fans now "well, that escalated quickly"\n
I don't think even the most confident among us said they didn't stand a chance. Hell I thought we were gonna win the series, but holy shit the Warriors are on some next level shit. 
Can we start talking about how JR Smith completely disappears in the NBA Finals? Fucking nuts.
Ugly. Does Lue take any heat for this?
http://pbs.twimg.com/media/CkO_cV9W0AAR6eB.jpg
Kyrie is better at folding laundry than playing basketball. 
Survey for Cavs fans:  Would y\'all honestly be mad if LeBron said "Fuck this, I\'m out"?  He\'s shown where his heart is...isn\'t that enough?  \n\nI feel really sad thinking about what the legacy of one of the greatest players ever could end up looking like if he stays in Cleveland.
[Not a Cavs fan] If he leaves again to go to another team that is already established, his legacy will go to shit. He saved face by returning to CLE and taking them back to the Finals two years in a row, if he leaves again after times get tough, he'll look like a coward. \n\nEDIT: On top of that, if he goes somewhere out West it's no guarantee he'll make to back to the finals, and there no team in the East he can go to that has anymore talent than CLE has right now. 
This series would be so different if the Cavs didn't have Kyrie or Love
Where's a picture of this Blond girl with iggy I keep hearing about

Kevi Love has never won a finals game.
Can we finally have a serious discussion about abandoning the West/East conference system?  The Thunder had a much better series with the Warriors than this is shaping up to be, and likely would also wipe the floor with the Cavs.
Bruh i have tickets to game 5.... CLEVLAND JUST WIN 1 FUCKING GAME

Cavs fans in shambles. This was the year they had something for the Warriors with Kyrie and Love they told us lmao
Things will be different this year! They have Kyrie and K. Love!\n\nMaybe not different in the way Cavs fans expected but it\'s certainly been different. Definitely no OT these first two games. 
Did LeBron mean Oakland when he said he was 'getting one for the Land'? Sure looks like it the way the cavs played today
Can we just replay the OKC GS series and that can be the finals?
The last time the Warriors did this to the Cavs, David Blatt lost his job within the month. Fat load of difference between "having the locker room" and not.
So do the warriors throw game 4 so they can give the home crowd the championship in game 5? /s
I'm just here for the memes
Mexico won y'all!
This may be a crazy idea to most of you, but I would bring Irving and Love off the bench. Give them the closing minutes in the 4th if needed. These guys are such defensive liabilities, last yrs team is actually better than this one. I honestly feel they are better suited as bench players. If they are serious about winning, Lue needs to consider this for game 3.
I'm starting to think that whichever team wins the Western Conference inevitably goes on to beat the Cavs. 
OKC Vs GS was the real finals. 
Good thing Kyrie and Love are healthy this year, what would Cleveland have done without their 7/21 combined shooting tonight?

Coach blatt is having a beer somewhere cracking up with his boys
If only David Blatt wasn't holding back this team.
Cavs aren't battle tested. The 5th best team in the west gives the east's 2nd best team a run for their money. Must be nice to waltz in to the finals unscathed, but this is the price for that. Hopefully 2 games will be enough for them to adjust to the level of play or this series is over. 
offensively, LeBron's decline as a player is a big deal. I know we try to pretend like it's not, but I'm gonna go ahead and say that it's IMPOSSIBLE for the Cavs to beat anybody actually half decent until he regains his jumper. Otherwise, it's just too hard to score points...he might be able to lift a dreadful supporting cast to something that's not awful, like he did in last year's Finals, but there's a very low ceiling to the team offense against a defense like this, ESPECIALLY with defenders that can match up very well with LeBron. Even with superior offensive talent now, they're struggling to score, and it comes down to LeBron having the same serious flaws he had when he was a kid going up against SA or Boston...except he doesn't have the same motor and insane explosion off the dribble to somewhat combat that. 07/08 LeBron, THAT LeBron could have played better if he had better offensive help...but this LeBron doesn't have the off-the-dribble explosion anymore, and coupled with the lack of a jumper, he just can't do much offensively without ball stopping, grinding the offense to a halt, and just playing generally ugly basketball. All the offensive help in the world doesn't mean **** when he can't do anything off the dribble.
i hate dahntay jones but that euro step with the ball fake was FUCKING DURTYYYYYYYYYYYYY
The sad part is that this is the strongest the eastern conference has been in the last few years. 
As a fan of basketball, this series is a let down. Cavs you were supposed to make this interesting. You suck ass Cleveland. 
Lol remember when Cavs fans claimed they would have won last year?\n\n\nLol dumb fuckers
If the Cavs made it to the finals, and suck this bad, can you just imagine how badly all of the other teams in the Eastern Conference suck? 
Dude. They blew through that conference like a train vs. hay. \n\nWestern Conference is extremely over powered
Was that game embarrassing for Cleveland? Yes.\n\nBut the reality is, they're the 4th best team in a 3 team league. And the margin between 1-3 and 4 is wider than we thought.
When it is this year, East vs West, yes.\n\nBut in the West you have the Warriors, the Thunder, and the Spurs.
I just dont understand how you dont play Frye anymore. You dont even give the guy a chance to show that he can play his game and not be that bad on defense. Cleveland adjusts too much to GSW that they disrupt their own formula. You can't win if the other team just dictates everything and only you adjust. You have to put something on the table.

I don't understand the point of the spoiler tag. The title spoils everything...
This Finals is boring as fuck. GSW are great but its fucking boring\n\nEDIT : Pretty sure got downvoted by GSW fans. 
As a true Lebron hater and someone who loves watching beautiful offense I disagree. In having fun watching him get his ass whooped. 
An all time great team shows up THAT ALSO MATCHES UP PERFECTLY WITH US just to stop us from winning after LeBron comes home. \n\nIf that doesn't scream curse, idk what does. 
If it wasn't Golden State, it would have been OKC.  If it wasn't going to be OKC, it would have been San Antonio.  If GSW, OKC, and SAS didn't exist, Cleveland might have been able to beat the Clippers--maybe.  
Was Tom Brady at the game, because Cavs looked deflated
http://i1138.photobucket.com/albums/n535/benn1ce/toucher.png
Some things I noticed after watching Game 2:\n\n* The Cavs tried hard as hell to run offense through Curry (+ extra handsy defense to get in his head) in the 3rd as a way to try to get Curry a 4th foul. While it eventually did work by chance (fastbreak), the Cavs offense looked completely out of rhythm and it never recovered.\n* Jefferson was Lue's answer to Livingston/Barnes abusing Kyrie. While it did prevent easy midrange shots, it also forced other Cavs to help harder on D since switching becomes less effective (you can't switch Jefferson onto Curry or Klay). This meant a lot more going under the screen or LeBron helping a bit too much which = open Dray 3s.\n* The Cav's vaunted big men/offensive rebounding has been neutralized by all of the cuts made by Curry and Klay. It puts the Cavs bigs out of position for offensive rebounding making it much easier for the Warriors to box out. This only works because Lue has to compensate for Kyrie and Love's poor D (less Delly and Moz, though Moz looks pretty dead post injury). Blatt's plan of a slower paced game with defense over offense is starting to look better by the day.\n* It's hard to tell with Curry's foul-limited minutes this game, but it looks like he's made an adjustment to the Cav's extra handsy off-ball D. He's picking up the pace (if that's even possible) and making faster decisions after getting the ball. That gives the Cavs less time to communicate about switching or staying at home and is causing all sorts of havoc off of hockey passes.\n\nIt's as if the Warriors weren't satisfied with just winning. They went into the second game with the goal of completely dismantling any perceived advantages that the Cavs had in Game 1, and it worked. Kerr showed up with adjustments on top of adjustments to Game 2 while Lue showed up with a single change to his game plan. That is not enough for the Cavs to close the gap.
Oh look, it\'s the "LEBRON HAD NO HELP!" wagon turning its wheels again. \n\nThis isn\'t 2007 for those fuckboys who actually believe that still applies. 
DRAY FOR MVP SCREW /r/NBA
Its just sad on Cleveland's side. 2/3 of your big 3 isn't showing up, getting abused on defense over and over, and its the same offensive gameplan as last year except Lebron isn't playing like himself either so the iso isn't working.
Man the game thread was great.\n\n\n> They should implement soccer style relegation. Teams get relegated to the East.\n\n\n> What would it do to lebron legacy if he signs with GS for the minimum and they win for the rest of the decade?\n\n\n> You know it's garbage time when you see a lot more white guys out there\n\n\n> Lebron pulling a regular season curry, not playing in the 4th quarter\n\n\n>\xc2\xa0Should Shumpert cut his hair?\n\n\n>\xc2\xa0How you gonna pay 1k+ for some seats and leave early?? Smh y'all trippin I'm spending the night.
LeBron confusing what "Land" he\'s doing it for. ITS CLEVELAND LEBRON. You\'re supposed to be doing it for Cleveland. Not Oakland
Dammit Cavs. I really wanted that free Doritos Locos Taco.\n\nI hope Taco Bell has the same deal for game 3.

Embarrassing. The worst thing about this is Cavs are very clearly the best team in the East. 
If the cavs were people:\n\nLebron would be the dad trying to make his kids do something but no one cares\n\nKyrie is the kid whose older brother made varsity so he thinks he\'s too good to try\n\nRJeff is the older uncle who tries a little too hard in pickup basketball\n\nLove is the younger brother who gets blamed for everything\n\nRest of the players are just hiding in the corner\n\nTy Lue is the oblivious mom who thinks her kids are growing up so they do whatever, ultimately hurting themselves \n\nBlatt is the guy cashing in checks saying "I told you so" as he brought the injured version of this exact team to the same spot, but with 2 more wins
I'm not a big warriors fan but I think it's hilarious they become one of the best ever in time to cockblock Cleveland from 2 finals\nIn a row just when bron formed super team #2
It was really cool of the NBA to make a new rule this year that the first 2 games of the Finals were exhibitions so players could get a feel for the game. Now I'm ready for the real finals to start!

LOL OKC WAS UP 3-1 AHAHAHAA
As a huge Lebron hater, I have to say i'm loving this series.  
Kristen ledlow can get it http://imgur.com/AfMp8Hk
But, but...Lebron and the Cavs are HEALTHY now--and he's the best player of ALL TIME, and the best athlete in the world...surely, they're just toying with the Warriors and will win it all...right?
After two games in the Finals, Lebron is leading the Cavs in points, rebounds, assists, and tied for 1st in steals and blocks. \n\nHe's getting literally no help
Don't forget the other stat he leads in:  Turnovers.
I think for the Cavaliers it's clearly mental at this point, cuz they have the talent and good depth, maybe not enough to beat GS but it should be more competitive than this for sure... but guys are playing timid, and aren't making their shots. They get demoralized too easily. 
http://imgur.com/5Tas4zb
OKC had me stressed every freaking game. The West really is superior. 
Guess GSW/OKC was the finals after all.
The only reason the Cavaliers lost is because they scored less points than the Warriors.
It was nice of the broadcast team to give a shout out to the WNBA. I'm sure the Cavs appreciated the recognition.
Its a little bittersweet knowing this is the last game at oracle this season. 
Lol
We have too many one dimensional players. No chance. We had a good run. 
Imagine if the Cavs were to healthy doe. It would be a series \xf0\x9f\x98\x82\xf0\x9f\x98\x82
Lets not act like he played well either. He had 8 TOs, two of which were travels. 
Can we all agree now that Draymond is Top 10?  The guy is a beast!
Please tell me your being sarcastic. This is the 2nd best team Lebron has had in the finals, very close to the best team he has had in the Finals. Please see this article ["Cavs are better this year"](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/lebron-and-the-rest-of-the-cavs-are-better-this-year/). The Talent is there, it is scheme and gameplan. \n\nAlso, the WCF showed us a series isn\'t over until its over. \n\n***EDIT: I was pulling this from memory, apparently this team is the 3rd  best of the 7 teams. The Top 3 teams are MUCH better than the bottom 3.***
Well yes.  He does?  Just because the people that are supposed to be helping (and talented enough to do so in most cases) aren't doesn't make him suddenly able to carry a team over the Warriors by himself?
I'm pretty sure OKC would shit on the Cav's the way they're playing.
Youre talking about a team that had 3 #1 picks and then the number one player in the world join them. It shouldve been cleveland breaking records not the warriors. Thats why they are getting shat on lol
Well when you call yourself the "chosen one" and "King James" and do things like [this](http://politic365.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2010/07/lebron-james-witness-e1278473182639.jpg) you\'re kinda asking to be held to an insane standard
Why? He basically manufactured the team he is on
I feel bad for his poor decision making, like leaving Miami, getting Blatt fired, thinking Love was Bosh etc.\n\nBetter?
I am pretty sure that is the point of running plays and imparting "philosophies."
Mark Jackson fucked it up?
/r/NBA in a nutshell everybody 
Because he doesn't need to be. 
After decades of being mostly garbage? Yeah, shitty for us fans to enjoy this. 
You sound like a little shit. 
As a basketball fan I can appreciate his game on the court. As a person I think he is a lying front running egomaniac. \n\nAs a fan of a rebuilding team and a team that had to trade it's superstar. I hate how lucky the Cavs were in their rebuild. How many number ones did they luck into. How often do you get a superstar deal like they got with Love. Good thing he hasn't played like one since the trade though. Lol
That last minute of game time was the saddest I've witnessed. I'm pretty sure Milhouse's dad on The Simpsons tried harder to save his marriage than the Cavs did to win the game.
Hello darkness my old friend
LeBron: "I sleep in a Kia k900 do youuu?"\n\n\nCurry: "I sleep in a big bed with my 2015 & 2016 Larry O\'Brien Trophies"
This [fan](http://i.imgur.com/sY4D42o.gifv) shares your sentiment.
that was some LeBron and Kyrie stat padding in the end
Did they legitimately take ONE three in the last 90 seconds of game time? I don't remember one. Just let LBJ drive to the hole for a layup, using 15-20 seconds every time, matched by Steph or Klay hitting free throws...it's just pure stat padding. So confusing. So disheartening for Cavs fans, I'd think. 
but jacking up threes was their ONLY hope then. just going to the hoop is suicidal.
There is 0% chance the cavs win by going for layups down 9 with 40 seconds to go when they are trading pts with two good FT shooters on GS. Jacking up 3s would've at least have given them a chance to catch up instead of simply treading water.
Regardless of them not making 3s all game you have to go for 3s down 9 with under a minute to play if you want a chance to win it. If you keep trading 2s with the other team you might as well just dribble out the game instead because all you're doing is stat padding at that point.
No, LeBron immediately drove - the only way what you are saying is true is if the only person the Cavs wanted to take a 3 was LeBron. Which, I guess is true - but egregiously bad coaching and/or gameplay by LeBron. You can't trade layups for fouls against Curry and Thompson who are NOT going to miss at the line. #math 
LeBron literally waited for the defence to get to their formation before driving to the hoop. Like what the fuck? You don't even have a mid-range junper and you let the opponent get to their defensive formation?
And yet he wasn't driving at all earlier in the game when it might have actually helped. What the fuck. 
Yeah super weird. Like you have 2 nearly 90% free throw shooters how are you going to make up an 8 pt deficit by making layups? \n\nEdit free throw 
Lebron wants to know is he can borrow a feeling. 
Hurtin' hearts need some healing.
I can spare him a jar of Love.
He has enough of that. Do you have a jar of Wade maybe?
Lebron's heart needs some healing.
Take my hand with your Dubs of love!!!

this is grand.
The Cleveland Cavaliers spent over 200 million U.S. Dollars on players last offseason just to watch Lebron James and Kyrie Irving iso for 12 minutes.
Should've spent it on an actual coach 
Yeah, that was ridiculous IMO.\n\n>Hey we're keeping this game close by moving the ball around and making smart plays, what should we do next?\n\n>I know! Let's make Lebron and Kyrie dribble for 10s at the top of the key.\n\nEveryone that said Lue is a better coach than Blatt looks like an absolute fool now.
Who the fuck did? Even if they dominated their division, my view hasn't changed. Blatt is by far a better coach. Lue has no head coaching experience, compared to Blatt. CLE management really needa to go. So bad.
>Who the fuck did?\n\nYou're joking right? You could find tons of comments with hundreds of upvotes about this exact thing when Lue was winning 10 playoff games in a row. Some people were unconvinced and still saying that Blatt did just as well in the playoffs, but that was not even the majority opinion.
he wasn't playing though. it's the responsibility of the players to trust each other
Exact same thing could be said about Blatt.
Lue literally said during the game he wants to see more ball movement.
Which led to...
Lebron is the coach.
Well, when you dribble, you move the ball up and down.
I don't think Lue wanted that, he was ragging on them earlier for not moving it. Kyrie and LeBron just developed tunnel vision
I'm a Blatt fan, and prefer him to Lue for the most part. But I think the iso's are Lebron and Kyrie's doings. They're just playing hero ball and downright ignoring the offensive schemes
That's exactly what Westbrook and KD did down the stretch and that killed their momentum
Makes you wonder what the warriors are doing to encourage that sort of play, or if both the Cavs and Thunder just start fucking up toward the end of big games. 
I don't understand it... Why was Tristan Thompson on the bench when he was manhandling us? Why the hell was Channing Frye in that early? What the hell were the refs doing during the game? Was Lue paid to watch 2 players play iso? I'll take the win, no lie, but wth was going on.
0-5 FTs, easy hack target. I would still roll with Thompson after seeing Frye play though, he's not getting open at all.
Yeah, but with 2 minutes left, he needs to be on the floor. And even if it's hack-a-Thompson, in a physical game, they sacrificed their rebounding advantage for... Frye? So that they could just play iso and not give Frye the ball?
Yea but honestly the only reason GS got going was all the fucking rebounds. The Cavs control the tempo when TT is in cause the dude dominates the shit out of the middle.\n
The rebounds are what changed the game IMO. It was a close game, and they put up a stat about TT beasting on the boards. GSW started getting tons of second and third chances though and that just blew the game up. (relatively speaking of course, it was still close at the time.)
but most of those came off of Love with TT on the bench
Seriously their offense is so lazy I can't believe how they literally go five or more possessions in a row with iso ball just to jack up a three or long contested shot. Not even just Kyrie and his blackhole ballstopping ass, or LeBron's awful J, but when they go into iso mode everybody else literally just stands there and before you know it the shot clock is at 5 and nobody has moved. God forbid they set screens for each other or make any movement off the ball. It's just like the Thunder in games 5-7 except the Cavs run the clock all the way down before chucking where as the Thunder just ran up the court and chucked. 
And they let go David Blatt who's a offensive genius, scrap his offense before they even gave a fair try. 
Coaches are hamstrung by Lebron. He won't allow more complicated offenses that don't include him in an ISO.
I think Spoelstra was pretty damn good.
I don't really think Lebron is the problem.\n\nKyrie ADMITS to getting lost on defense. I am sure he probably gets lost on offense and doesn't admit it. Love isn't very athletic to begin with. Shump is a defensive specialist, basically. I have no comment on J.R. Because he's really random.\n\nBasically, I don't think half the Cavs player can play in complicated offense, but Lebron definitely can. Lebron's really damn smart and has great court vision. And anyone who wants to argue just look at the Miami years.\n\nThe difference is Bosh, Wade, Allen, Battier are all smart players (and capable defenders).
? Heat played a really nice offense 
Spo's a better coach. Shame we didn't get  to see much of Blatt's play design. I remember break downs of his euro stuff was pretty.
Yeah cavs need to get into offense much quicker. \n\nI'm not sure why LeBron uses screens just solely to get a mismatch. He can drive on any of GSW with out having a mismatch. And if he does get a mismatch why not get it while attacking the screen? \n\nWhy can't cavs get LeBron a post up anywhere close to the basket? Warriors post up Barnes and Thompson closer than Cavs post LBJ. 
Are you honestly fucking kidding me? Wtf are you taking about. Before tonight he was leading the series in points rebounds assists and minutes pergame. Yah just some haggard old man. You just hate on lebron because he has shat all over your team for the last decade
Idk, I'm not sure if I saw a single post up at all during game 4. \n\nI don't get how pro coaches are so bad at coaching and utilizing him and his size/strengths. 
Novice here, whats iso?
Isolation. When a player calls for his teammates to space out the floor and allow his defender to take him 1 on 1 and basically just sit there and in this case just dribble.
Benefits of iso ball:\n\n* On rare occasions a player is good enough to steamroll an entire team for a game, maybe for two games. If they're truly great, they might win a few series this way (see LeBron's previous amazing series here and there, ie 25 pts in a row against Detroit https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Px-jPm_TU). But rarely a series.\n* Ummm can't think of any others. Big star gets big stats? Some highlight reel material?\n\nDisadvantages of iso ball:\n\n* No team chemistry, no flow, weakened morale on the court\n* Fewer offensive rebounds\n* Opponents get to rest on defense\n* Opponents don't have to adjust or adapt or deal with surprises 
Also, and maybe this is an obvious pro/con, but it gives the other 8 players on the court a bit of a rest. \n\nIf an offense runs a ton of isos, it's less tiring over the course of the game (assuming the isos are spread out amongst players) as they don't have to expend energy setting or coming off screens, making cuts, etc. And of course, this also is less tiring for the defense, who won't have to spend energy fighting through screens/switching/chasing backdoor cuts. \n\nAnother pro of an iso play is that it lets you easily attack a player who is in foul trouble -- the Cavs actually did this to Klay Thompson last night late in the 2nd quarter (Klay had 2 fouls). 
one more potential pro: it slows the game waaay down and limits fast break opportunities for the opposing team (e.g. last year's finals)
Less turnovers as well
So the advantage of isolation plays is when you think you have a mismatch.  If you think your guy can take their guy every single time, it makes sense to run an isolation play.  Typically LeBron is a good bet to win these matchups, so it makes some sense.  
Except if the other team sees that's all you do it's easy to play help defense since a lot times they are unlikely to pass (***looking at Irving, PG w 28 shots vs 4 assists)
kyrie runs full speed straight at the basket again

Kids in Africa are gonna think LeBron has the most rings ever by the end of his career.
FIVE TIME FIVE TIME FIVE TIME Champion...to the children of Africa
Messed up, but true 
To them MJ is trash, ain't got no shirts of the bulls, but Lebron? They have a shirt for nearly every day of the week
Lebron James and the Buffalo Bills are the greatest dynasties ever in Africa
What's the reference? I'm rather new.
Professional sports usually print enough t shirts for both teams competing in the championship game/series, which explains why the SECOND a team wins a Super Bowl, the NBA Finals, or the World Series etc., the winning team is all wearing hats and shirts that says the year and "world champions" or something.  \n  \nI\'ll give you one guess as to what happens to the shirts made for the teams that obviously don\'t get championship t shirts each year. 
Since nobody knows who is gonna win the play offs finals both teams camps manufacturers the winning t-shirts, hoodies and accessories which is intended to be worn after and during the last game of the play offs finals so that they can show support and celebrate.\n\nThe losing teams clothing gets sent out to africa and other third world countries  and since Lebron James has been in 7 finals and only won 2 (so far) the kids in africa who recieves the clothes will think that he keeps winning them.
That's kind of clever, thanks for explaining.

What do you mean the buffalo bills and Lebron aren\'t the greatest part about American sports?

They never thought they would see a dynasty like the 80s Bills again.

Lebron is going to be the Bill Russell of Africa

Just when you thought the comments couldn't be any more savage 
Good god the savagry
African Children ask if teams can beat the 95-96 Sonics
So I guess in the finals of big sports (NFL, NBA, etc.) they make Champions shirts for each team so that the players of the winning team can quickly put em on right after the game ends, and the shirts of the team that didn't win supposedly get sent to Africa/other 3rd world countries as donations 
If you make it to the championship in a sport they make shirts right away saying you won to sell. If you lose they donate it somewhere like Africa. LeBron loses a lot in the finals
This is a new level

Canada has taco bell and freedom.\n\nand free healthcare. checkmate.
Idc who wins. I just wanted free tacos. FINALLY! 
Good guy Lebron doing his this for the poor people in cleveland
From Portugal and we dont have Taco Bell so i guess i will make me a Taco just to feel like i belong :(
Getting free tacos for the land
Why is the free taco on the 21st? I guess they expect everyone to forget by then.
from 2-6pm too. cuz no one is at work then 
it's a $1.39 taco lmao.
Free is free. 
RemindMe! 10 days "free taco somewhere"
It was after the finals so that they could schedule it on that day for sure, without worrying about what happens in the games.\n\n The odds that the home team wins every game is very low, it hasn't happened in 60 years or something crazy
Consolation prize for every team that lost to the Warriors. \n\nThanks Steph!
[Andrew Bynum enjoyed this one](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Ckoi84lUoAENELr.jpg:large)
wait is this real?
https://twitter.com/ChatSports/status/741443546247516160
I can't believe he just disappeared off the map. I honestly hope he saved most of his money. He really doesn't owe us or the league anything in my opinion. Would be pretty cool if he has enough money to just chill the rest of his life. He was extremely lucky with this career but he achieved a lot either way.
It sounded like from just whispers around the league, from people that knew him, that Bynum never really loved the game. Sounds like it was just one of those things, people saw the type of body he was growing up into as a kid, told him he should play basketball, so he did and found success, but he never really had a passion for it himself. But hey, are you gonna turn down a bright future and potentially tons of money in the future? Probably not. But seems like once he got it, after a while, that lack of passion was just too strong.
I mean he struggled with his knees like his whole life as well. Having the first of many knee surgeries at like 12 years old and continuing to battle with that would suck. Combine that with possibly not loving the game that much and quitting after a couple rings and like 70 mil would probs be pretty appealing.
He was arguably the best center in the league at one point! I mean look at this [footwork and the moves!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPhM1Y8EUdw)
Haven't seen anyone really comment on it, but those minutes when Varejao played were great. He played with a great sense of urgency 
Honestly his minutes in the 3rd felt like the turning point of the game to me. The Dubs had been playing from behind, and personally I didn't really get the sense that they were confident. Usually when watching the Warriors, no lead really feels safe, but the Cavs lead felt safe to me. Then Varejao came in there and really seemed to spark them. He played like he wanted that ring. No way he wants to see Cleveland finally win a ring the same year they cut him after 12 years, AND have it be won against his current team. I'd be balling my ass off too in that situation.
He good guy mang.
For someone who gets a ring either way, he played his heart out today. 
He knows the Warriors rings will be massive compared to a Cavs ring
Honestly though. I can't imagine he would view the Cavs ring with any sense of pride at all. To me personally it wouldn't have much value at all. Not even a fraction that it would have if I actually won. 
When you\'re in the finals playing against the team that traded you, you don\'t want the biggest trophy of your career to be "lol remember when you got beat by the team that didn\'t want you anymore?" Everyone would rather win a ring by actually contributing to that team.
Who wouldn't want to beat the team that felt you weren't worth keeping
While the sentiment is understandable, even Varejao couldn't argue he was worth keeping with a straight face. The Warriors signed him for some Cleveland insider stories and for 6 finals fouls a game if needed.
He's also got a pretty good basketball iq, exactly the type of guy the warriors like for their bench
And the home crowd boo'd you the last game 
He played 12!?!?!?! years for Cavs and they traded him to save money, he was pissed and now they are booing him. I just cant believe how dumb some fans can be.
Everyone I know was upset about the trade. Then when he got on the warriors everyone was upset about him. Calling it a betrayel and shit. We traded him. He took his best option. People are so fucking dumb.
Cleveland in accounting don't give a fuck.
Idk what it is about Steph, but it seems like he pisses LeBron off way more than any other superstar in the league. LeBron is known for being buddy buddy with a lot of the league, but for some reason Steph really seems to irk him.
I think it\'s about Steph stealing his spot light. Taking consecutive MVP\'s. Everyone saying Steph is the best. Even after a Finals game where he scored 2 points in the half, he\'s still "better" than LeBron.
Steph doesn't go to clubs, curse,very regilious and seems to be a doting husband. He's really a dweeb probably in lebrons eyes.
Steph stole the spotlight. Simple as that, really. 
I fired coach blatt because of you!!!!
It's not about Steph pissing off Lebron; it's about Lebron being down 1-2 in the Finals against one of the most dominant teams in NBA history
It's cause Curry is tiny
I noticed this as well! Curry took Lebron's crown, right when Lebron was poised to make his redemption tour. 
Well I think part of the problem is lebrons grasp on the crown has always been tenuous as fuck.\n\nFirst he comes in the league as king James.\n\nHe develops a bit but jumps on the scene in 07 poised to be a finals mainstay for years to come.\n\nBut that gets interrupted by his team sucking and Kobe reclaiming he top spot.\n\nThen as Kobe finally fades and lebron is back in the finals everyone is washing it off as wades team, needing help, taking my talents to victory parades.\n\nThen lebrons ready to correct all that by winning it for the land and here comes steph and were ready to not only bash lebron the player, but now also lebron the GM/coach.\n\nSo I don\'t think it\'s anything particular about steph as much as culmination of a decade of "what do I have to do?!?!"
It's because he knows that curry dethroned him. and he's salty as fuck
Steph is the darling of the media now, and his team isn't going to let Lebron win another ring - at least not with this iteration of this team.  Lebron is probably just having a hard time coming to grips with fate
Because no other star in the league has been a threat to his global icon status like this before.  Steph is taking his MVP's, Steph is taking his titles, Steph can do no wrong with the media.  Besides the ghosts that Lebron is chasing, Steph is the first star that is actually rivaling him on the court and taking his spotlight.
Also, like it or not, steph curry actually looks like a human being, whereas lebron does not.
what does that even mean?
He's a skinny kid, LeBron is a beast. Easier to relate to.\n\n
It's like the Messi vs Ronaldo debate. Messi is more relatable because he is a 5 foot 7 average looking dude where Ronaldo looks like a Greek god.
I chose Greek god because they are portrayed as superhuman beings with perfect physique.
He's butthurt that Curry is ruining his Cleveland Redemption Plan. 
:)
In Curry's defense, LeBron just wanted to win one for the Land.  He never specified *which* land.
I don't know how this joke is still getting upvotes, y'all have beaten this poor line to death and then some.
Welcome to /r/NBA, home of crying Jordan faces, big if true, and savages. We're pretty much /r/blackpeopletwitter with basketball references.
To be fair, We call Oakland the "Town"\nOakTown
I know....PortLAND
Landerson Varejao
Curry won one for the (oak)land already
OakLand?
Well he also wanted to win 7(?) for Miami so there's that too 
He wanted to lose 7, we all just assumed he meant win. 
The Land of the Free and Home of the Brave  have won every single NBA finals
USA - 69, Canada - 0 
it's really wild to look back at the ncaa run that steph had and see lebron in the stands enjoying it. 
I wonder if LeBron heard a prophecy about the one who would come after him and take his crown, and in his fear, LeBron went to see the young man that was prophesized, got one look at Steph and decided not to worry. I bet he wishes he'd killed Steph when he had the chance. \n\nSorry, been reading lots of GoT fan theories lately...
LeBron is King Herod now?
That's what happens when someone smaller, younger, and less athletic than you takes your crown AND throne. And then makes you dance for his amusement.
Also the fact that Curry just doesn't care about any adversity. He isn't phased and doesn't let the emotions of the game take over. Kobe said it best in that he really plays in the moment.
whos dancing now lol
Oh for sure man
Smaller, younger, less athletic, better looking, better friends with Drake, the list goes on
Did you just describe Joffrey
Just like many of of the old retired stars like Barkley, these guys are watching the NBA transform into a different style of play in front of their very eyes and the new face of the league is so different than the guys they grew up worshipping.... guys who could fly above the rim or dominate the paint. They don't know how to react. So they're pissed.
This is a REALLY good way to describe it 
You're right Lebron sill has his crown as evidenced by him winning mvp the last two years and winning both finals.
So Duncan's the king?
Can robots be king?
Yep. Lebron is clearly the king. Mvp two years in a row.
Game 2 he had 18 points on 7/11 4/8 3P and 9 rebounds in 24 mins.... That's embarrassing?
How did LeBron outplay Curry this game? 
> Except for this game\n\n
Sorry the NBA is a team game?  And Sorry people like Curry more?  People know James is good,  they just like watching Curry shoot, stop being offended. 
And handle the ball. People always underrate his ball handling skills. Sometimes it feels like he\'s got it on a string. But to go back to the above dudes tirade, I think Steph has more fans because the guy just seems more relatable and likable. LeBron always wanted to be liked and it came off as a weird sort of political pandering. People like Steph because he wasn\'t crowned the day he showed up. He worked from the shadows for awhile, got better better before our eyes but always stayed the same dude it seemed. LeBron tried to have it all. He wanted to leave Cleveland and not be hated. That\'s how you get shit like "The Decision" and then jerseys burning in the streets. I had more to include, but now I can\'t remember and I\'m tired...
I thoroughly enjoy watching Lebrons signature drive to the basket while arm barring for a layup/dunk. It's so thrilling! /s 
https://imgflip.com/i/15o9l6
GOOD POINT
when the king turns into the jester
Bang
This Warriors team and Steph is the first time LeBron hasn't been the driving narrative in the NBA since he became the best player. Its the first time his face of the league status has been legitimately threatened. I think a lot of superstars around the league feel threatened or tired of Curry being the golden boy and becoming a sports phenomenon.
I don't think Lebron has been the driving narrative in the NBA except for his villain turns. If you ask anyone who doesn't follow the NBA about LeBron chances are all they'll know about is him being good and the decision. If anything he should be glad Draymond Green came along and took away his most hated man in ball title. 
Because he's really, really good.
Also he seems to be allowed to nut shot guys with impunity. 
Because he likes to karate people in the balls 
I don't know if it's as personal as that. Couldn't it just be Lebron wants to win, and the Warriors making his team look like chumps is frustrating to him?
Especially being a shooter. Golden state is changing the way NBA ball is played. 
Tristan Thompson on the bench in the clutch that was Lue's basketball crime
People said this sub overreacted after game 2 but now we see why it wasn't. A rookie coach has very low chances of beating an all-time great team at oracle two times in a row.
I don't know how many games it will take Cleveland to beat the Warriors 3 times but it sure as shit isn't 3. 
Offensive rebounds? Pfft don\'t need em
Except the guy couldnt hit a free throw to save his life this game. 
He was a free throw liability 
Some people don't want to admit GS is just better. Lue has no options.
The issue with the Cav bench is that for everything they do well, there is something they do horribly.  You have to pick and choose which liability you are willing to live with at that time.  GS doesn't have that much of a problem.  And depending on certain lineups their opponents put on the floor, their Bench matchups might be even *better* than their first 5.
Completely destroyed their rebounding advantage
Thompson was balling so fucking hard. It's a travesty he was off of the floor for so long.
As a Warrior fan, I am literally fearing TT more than Lebron this series.
I think kerr would have started hacking him, but still. Shouldve been out there
I meant before that. He sat for a while 
Yep. He was something like 0/5 from the line if I remember right. 
Yea..... gotta at least make 50% come on TT
I guess Lue wanted more 3s from Frye. Too bad they were 1-9 in the second half.
He didn't shoot whole game, so why he even expected points from Frye? TT was on fire and when camera shown his face at the end of game  I saw his dissapointment
Dude blew assignment after assignment, wtf was he doing on the floor in crunch time 
There's a reason the Suns declined to re-sign him at that price - he's a very streaky shooter and his defense and rebounding is just plain bad.\n\nPeople laughed and acted like we didn't know what we were giving up but anyone who watched the Suns enough knew already - he's a turnstile.
I know, everyone has been talking about Love's defense, but damn Frye's was bad. He seemed to have no idea what the defensive gameplan was.
Frye makes Love look like Bill Russell defensively
I guess he was there to shoot 3's except Lue forgot he had to actually draw up a play for that to happen
It was like a kid playing NBA 2K. Spends most of clock trying to force into the paint with LeBron and if that doesn't work outlet pass to chuck contested 3. They almost always pick Cavaliers too.

He's had two bad finals games. Stop giving him excuses.
Oh and Kevin Love and Kyrie Irving--who 538 and everyone else--said was a championship triumvirate. No rewriting history now...
I would hate to coach or play with Lebron. Sure he's one of the greatest but if you win, he gets all the credit and if you lose, you get all the blame. Hell even if you do win, he just gets the credit for carrying your ass. 
Yeah but even then, it's essentially insinuating that the team sucks. He's just getting shit on for not building a good enough team. 
I mean, Kyrie is pretty damn good...
After closely watching this Cavs playoff run, I would honestly hate having Kyrie as my starting point guard. Especially for how much they are paying him. 
He ain't D-Wade though. 
Nevermind Wade's age dude. Kyrie will never touch prime Wade
My friend was adamant that Kyrie will have a better career than Wade. Lol
That shouldn't be a knock against Kyrie though, it's a select class that can come close to prime Wade
https://imgur.com/bTM9xeQ
https://imgur.com/83vLQb4
Perfect. 
D-Wade is.
...barely.
He ain't some scrub either. If LeBron needs a player of Wade's caliber to win that's sad.
I agree. It kind of takes away from Lebron if he needs Wade to win. This Cavs team has a good supporting cast.
Nah man, you don't see it do you?\n\n\n. \n \n. \n\n. \n\n. \n\n. \n\n\n\nHe needs Chalmers. 
I mean 34 points on 50% shooting isn't exactly garbage level...
But his defense isn't even remotely close to Wade. Same for Bosh vs Love. 
That gonna be the excuse this year? I swear man watch Lebron lose the finals next year again with Miami and Lebron fanboys will say "well d-wade is too old now"
Kyries kinda like james harden without the passing
I also think Hardens a much better scorer.
Amazing, kyrie pretty much outplayed him today, and this will be the narrative
kyrie scored more, he didn't outplay bron. kyrie had his own harden-esque montage of blown assignments after a commercial break.
Kyrie had some great defensive stops but he was an overall negative\n\nHowever, I'm of the opinion that lebrons constant lane jumping for steals is a detriment, especially when the Warriors aren't turning it over like retards, as in game 3
Excuses again. TT and Kyrie balled tonight.
I think Kyrie scored 2 points in the 4th quarter. His potential is obvious and he has a world of talent, but he's not the finished product yet. 
He is still a very good player. To imply Lebron doesn't have a supporting cast is deeply misguided.
They aren't deeper than Golden State, maybe every other team but not Golden State so it's not fair for them.  /s
And that's when LeBron should have taken over. Teams look to their leader to get them to the finish line. The supporting cast did their job for the first 3 quarters and kept the game close while LeBron was being extremely passive when he had key opportunities to score. This was a let-down game from LeBron.

Whoa. Plot twist. 
it might go unnoticed because of the splash bros heroics, but Barnes had a really good game today
His offense was money, but kinda spacey on defense. It's funny cause its usually the other way around.
He's been quietly really good this series. Hitting open shots, getting boards, not trying to do too much.
>When Lebron levels the series in 2-2 and his team comes firing back in the next two games, I will remind everyone in this thread about their obsessive overreaction lol.

Can someone start a poll on which tattoo he should get?
One with the Larry O Brien trophy I guess.

He didn't specify the tattoo, I suggest a tasteful dickbutt
Yo get in here fam we got another debt owed to /r/nba

And that's the last anyone's heard of him

Where the fuck are YOU at kid?!
Thumbed back to see his flair (Spurs if you can believe it...) and came across this gem... Just not your years Warriors, sorry:\n\n>"Steph and Klay have been cold through the series. They can stop Steph, Warriors can\'t stop Lebron. Lebron is due an explosive game too. I\'d be very worried tbh. This is not your year sadly. :/"\n\nSpent a lot of time begging to be tagged; what\'re the odds he shows to eat this delicious crow you\'ve begun serving him? 
The series isn't over yet. If Lebron loses, I will admit my mistake and get the tattoo, man. But let the series actually play out. 
Takes a big man to show up to one of these. I'll upvote you just for showing up. 
Unfortunately my client u/_bluberries_ has explosive diarrhea from eating his own words. We ask that you respect his privacy in this sensitive time. 
Oh this thread is fucking gold right now!
seriously, is a goldmine lmaoo
oh little blueberry buddy. your comment history shows a new level of delusion. Dont get this tattoo though. its not worth it to get internet strangers to respect you. But also, stop writing checks with your mouth that your ass cant cash.
And doesn't have to
Yeah, don't be even more of an idiot /u/_bluberries_ -- just take this as a lesson to stop running your mouth.
I mean, no matter what faith you have, don't swear to be tattooed over a bet...and I have 15 tattoos...
>I am still sure that Cavs are winning this year.\n\nBut, like, why? 
I just have a good feeling about this. Lebron will step up. Anyway, let's talk after the series is over because I feel every discussion is presumptuous at this point. 
Lebron has had 4 chances to step up this series and he's done it 1.5 times.
4.5 times*
Because he's fucking rain man that's why
Lol, looks like you're the idiot now.
He been gone for 2 days. Deep in his heart he knew what Game 4 would entail.
hindsight sure is a motherfucker huh
Rekt.  Simply rekt.
How can OP be that confident in LeBron when the cavs are facing a team that lost only 9 games in the regular season? 
because once golden shite werriors start shooting bricks, they lost. And he's right to have faith on bron after today 
Because LeBron is the greatest player of the last 17 years and some average point guard who is insanely fire from 3 does not change that
upvote this man, where you at u/_bluberries_
Welp after this series he's getting a new username lol 
Eh, I am not a coward. I will keep my word if Lebron loses this year, as I have said. 
Does the community get to vote on what tattoo you get?
No, it doesn't look like the community gets to vote on what tattoo to get.  Cos, you know.......
I vote dick butt with a LeBron jersey
i've said it before and i'll say it again: you a real one
What tattoo should he get? "2/7"?
maybe u/_bluberries_ could just get a big EASTERN CONFERENCE logo somewhere. 1. cause they suck, 2. cause he's a lol spurs fan
We all know it has to be Jordan crying
Who looks stupid now?

better yet, wear his regular sneakers, and after his first miss, call timeout, change shoes, and then [give this look to the camera](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-OGrMmq7yT0U/US52Us1pRXI/AAAAAAAAGng/qRzYeX9EG0U/s640/Stephen+Curry+Soon.jpg) \n\n*edit* thought of an even better idea, instead of a gatorade dunk, curry just empties a bunch of the shoes on kerr

Dude in the the glasses kept screaming "fuck you!" and pointing to Livingston and Curry. They should look to Westbrook for guidance. 
The fat kid was triggering me so hard early on

Guess Curry heard us saying that he's not playing like an MVP. Also, idk what practice Windhorst was at.
Windhorst (kind of) threw some shade at Curry's performance during today's practice saying he was *terrible* & that everything was just off.
As Windhorst comes home to a microwaved 4th meal and slams down some Cheetos. *Windhorst sighs* 
Windhorst said he saw Curry practice & that he just looked terrible throughout that instance and also stated that everything just looked off about him. ([Link](http://espn.go.com/video/clip?id=espn:16101819))
I mean even in the game Livingston went off, Draymond was the best defensive player on the floor (40 minutes played) while being 3ast away from a triple double (16pts, 11reb, 7ast).\n\nLivingston really was amazing in that game though so yeah, he brought the momentum & was efficient as hell.
wtf he scored 38? so quietly too. it amazes me that he can score almost 40 and i don't even really notice it happening
He had a good amount of sly layups throughout the game & hit some nice 3s in the clutch. \n\nCombine his quick cuts to the lane, 10 FTA & legendary 3PT shot, then 38 points is easy money.\n\nAlso props to his squad for having the ball flow around constantly to keep Cavs defense on its toes, allowed Curry to sneak & push a ton.
he missed so many freebies too. 
Who gets MVP in this series? That's what I'm wondering now. Can you just give it to the team?
I kinda want Green to win FMVP just to see this sub burn.
Unless Curry goes for 40, I think Draymond has it in the bag.
If it's a close game again on monday and Curry leads the way to a win then I can see it happening.
In his hopes and dreams
Vince and T Mac said him shooting bad in practice was a sign he was going to have a great game
If you heard their drawn out explanation and not my summary then it might make more sense.  These are two guys who played the game at the highest level.  I trust their experience over your skepticism.  And they were right...
I honestly thought TMac and VC were full of shit when they said that... But they were right. 
yeah its possible over-confidence with the 3 is bad going into a game. Like Klay was stepping up and taking 30 footers when he was starting 0-5 in the last game. It's way better when Curry and Klay get hot with natural shots before taking crazy ones.
Crazy to think that those 11 missed free throws could have changed the game completely. The Cavs just looked defeated even when they were still within reach.
They were tired. I hate this dialogue around the lack of drive. I think the Cavs are fucking gassed. They have to give 110% to match the Warriors at 90-100%. They can't do that for the whole game.
not to mention, they have to play insane minutes because they have no bench.
That stretch where they missed something like six in a row and went from up 2 to down 9 absolutely killed them. You can't let this Warriors team get that much momentum
Yeah man. Was really frustrated watching them give up that early. Congrats btw
Well Tristan and LeBron missed a lot of them. Good fouls by the Warriors.
Pressure is a crazy thing
Kevin Love missed consecutive free throws....wtf
Concussion.  
They looked gassed , the bench isn't contributing anything so it looks like they didn't have a lot left in the tank after game 3. It's a testament to warriors depth
Seriously, I feel like this goes unnoticed. Same thing with OKC, KD and Westbrook played unbelievable amounts of minutes and Kerr down 8-12 points would be resting Curry or Thompson with 9 minutes to go. Cavs had to play hard for 8 quarters to beat this team at home.
It's so nice to have a team that misses free throws after those jerks at OKC. 
Steven Adams turning into fucking Curry on the line in that series. smh
I'm sayin!!!
I recall seeing Steph/Klay miss more than I saw Adams miss at the line last series..
I don't get why they were shooting 2's towards the end when GSW FTs are borderline automatic 
Warriors knew what they were doin letting Lebron get those layups 
Yeah, I'd take FTs by Steph and Klay over 2 pt attempts by anybody, any day.
padding stats 
Padding stats.
LeBron seemed to just drive to the hole every possesion at the end. While he was able to score, those 2points dont really chip away since curry and thompson are almost guaranteed to hit their FTs.\n\nSo it can be seen as padding his stats, since making 2s is almost pointless because 3s, from my perspective, were their only chance of chipping away.
Yup. Lebron went from 18 to 25 points in garbage time.
exactly, lebrons 19 points look weak as fuck but 26 is at least respectable. pretty embarrassing for someone like lebron to do that though.
LeBron was clearly padding his stats at the end there, absolutely no reason to not be shooting 3's in that situation. 
Not really, he's padding his stats so when they lose the finals he will still have a good line, but He did try for an assist. Remember that long pass Curry stole at the end? 
ended up helping the Splash bros to pad their stats too.
I hate to think that about someone like Lebron, but it did look like he knew he'd be roasted all weekend if he ended with only 19 points. 
He remembers his statline from 2011 and got PTSD. Take out the win, and the fluffed 7 points from this game and his statline looks JUST like 2011.
I absolutely can. He plays like shit in losses this series and you absolutely cannot assume that his 6-7 points that came when the game required 3s meant anything since the Warriors were leaving the paint open. 
It's called standardizing the data and is used in statistics all the time
Great quote. Not even a passable argument though.
you can when someone is down 9 with under 2 minutes to play and taking layups 
Some snotty kid in the future is gonna look up this boxscore and say Lebron had a monster game.
You mean tomorrow?
The Cavs with the perfect OKC impression tonight. 4th Quarter? Fuck everything we have been doing up to this point and worked, and let's run that marvelous heroball.
http://i.imgur.com/VvVjens.jpg
This is exactly what happened, the parallels are so real - Kyrie and LeBron iso plays over and over just like Russ and KD. Something about these 4th quarters man.
It\'s because the Warriors simply don\'t go away and people get desperate while the Warriors go "... okay." and don\'t change a damn thing.
It's fatigue. Players don't have that same energy to do so many screens and move off the ball so often in the shot clock, especially when you gotta lock in so much on the other end. I believe Kyrie, JR, and LeBron all played more than 43 minutes, LeBron played 45.5. Also this is the only game in the series with only 1 day off. 
The Warriors have been the best team in close games by a large margin all year.  Partially because their depth allows the starters to rest, partially because they execute well.  Why is the narrative that there's some magic thing that makes other teams choke? It's good defense, having more energy, and clutch shooting ffs!
OKC actually won more than one game though.
There's probably some deep-seated trust issues on these teams. They don't think anyone will get it done but themselves. That's something that can't be bought/trained. The W's were shit and developed together, but look at their chemistry now.    \nEdit: Alright, I get it.  But deep-seeded almost makes sense in a metaphorical way (though seeds sown too deeply won\xe2\x80\x99t grow).
I think Jackson said it in one of the games, when they get stressed they start taking turns and it doesn't work. There was like 8 possessions in a row, Lebron would bring it up: iso. Kyrie would bring it up: iso and repeat. ZERO passing.
deep-seated
No it is not\n\n*"Deep-seeded almost makes sense in a metaphorical way (though seeds sown too deeply won\xe2\x80\x99t grow), but deep-seated is the term you\xe2\x80\x99re looking for"*\n\nhttp://grammarist.com/usage/deep-seeded-deep-seated/
I\'m no psychologist, but I think there\'s another explanation instead of it being a trust issue. Feeling the responsibility to play hero ball doesn\'t necessarily mean they don\'t trust their teammates.\n\n I think it more stems from watching their heros seemingly play hero ball and take over crucial games, and then doing it themselves on their own all the way up until they make the pros, and during regular season.  But what was really happening was just that they were so focused on their idols when they were young, that they didn\'t fully grasp the big picture of winning as a team.  For the most part, it does work for them, and they made it this far believing it.   Also during the course of an 82 game season, they have a lot of games to cover up when the hero ball doesn\'t work, so on average, it has worked in the pros too (remember, pro athletes have to be able to forget their failures to focus on their successes).  \n\nBut in the playoffs, your performance in each and every game is under a microscope.  When hero ball works, you are a god. When it doesn\'t, you are anything but. \n\nSo in situations like this, they\'re reverting to their instincts that have largely worked for them their entire lives,  thinking, "my team needs me, I\'ve gotta take over, just like my hero did."  It usually works for them, but tonight, it did not. And every night in the playoffs that it doesn\'t work, we notice it a lot more. \n\ntl;dr  It\'s not you, it\'s me. 
Meanwhile Steph Curry had one game in college where he stood in the corner and let his teammates win. Curry came in averaging 35 after 5 games and the opposing coach thought they had no chance after watching him warmup. The opposing coach decided to double curry and literally go 3 on 4 with everyone else. \n\nEdit: tbh, this really doesn't mean anything, but your comment made me remember it. 
Even Kobe passed it to Ron Artest when it came down to the last minutes of the fourth. He wanted to win! Bron wanted to be the hero
I've never noticed it until now but I think Lebron genuinely hates Steph. 
Lebrons a pretty reasonable man
So he definitely hates him.
Has been reported a few times that he's mad jealous..
I think this season has shown that LeBron doesn't like not being considered the unanimous King. Even in Miami people hated him but we all still knew he was the best. This season with all the Curry love he just started to go into diva mode. 
I definitely don't think they like each other very much.
I don't think so, he just got super heated once he knew they lost. 
he hates Steph cause Steph gave his point guard three hezzies. [THREE HEZZIES DOE. Not 1, not 2, but THREE HEZZIES](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wX3eoMeXmzg).
And that nerdy kid takes rings from you years later. What a time to be alive.
its for sure weird. usually superstars who are adversaries have mutual respect for each other (kobe-lebron, kobe-garnett/pierce, durant-lebron). I feel like there is no relationship with these two.
It's not like Kobe/LeBron ever had a real rivalry though and LeBron handed KD's ass to him about every time they played.
I vaguely remember a video from the 2014 all star game or the olympics where Lebron is joking with Curry about how Curry schooled his point guard. Seems pretty friendly then. \n\nEdit: found it http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=wX3eoMeXmzg
He's no longer the top dog and it's hurting his ego. \n\nAbsolutely love it. 
> I don't think it's that, he's better than Steph as an overall player, but Steph has an amazing supporting cast that LeBron is probably jealous of. As well as a better coach.\n\nAs well as a jump shot. And range. And handles. And agility. And humility. 
And class, scruples, better looking, better passing, better teammate and connection with his team.
Must be why Cavaliers are up 3-1.
Don't forget NBA Finals winning percentage.
At what point can we stop blaming the supporting cast? Hes got the most expensive team ever and he picked these players. 
It'd be damn near impossible to pick out a better supporting cast than what Steph has in Golden State. 
Yeah but it the Cavs still have a very good one. It isnt like its Lebron against the world.
\\**Checks Warriors roster to see if GOAT Speights is still there*\\*  My god, he's right...
Goat was not needed to win the game
Yes, the prophesied 90 point game from the GOAT, our true savior, Mo H Speights.\n\nLet us bask in his eternal glory, yay be, rub the nub.
Yeah but he didnt realize he needed more chuckers. He's angry at himself for that and projects his anger onto the most prolific chucker of all time, who just so happens to be stealing the spotlight from him.
Needs more chuckers???
More chuckers?\n\nJ.R Smith, Mo Williams, Kevin Love, Matt Dellavedova, and Channing Frye all like to shoot. Cavs don't need chuckers, they need to play less iso. A lot less. 
Della never shoots.. Frye is a big man who seems to have lost his shot.. the team looks like it needs an explosive player off the bench.. 
He doesn't need more chuckers but teammates that actually have complete skillsets. 
He made a team in 2014 to win titles and they were perfectly constructed to do that. They are custom built to stomp the East (they do) then beat the Spurs or the Thunder in the Finals (Regular season: 2-2 vs SA and 3-1 vs OKC). What happened is they (along with the other 28 teams) weren't expecting the Warriors to come out of nowhere and change all the rules. People want to shit on LeBron and the Cavs roster, but this is simply a threat no one anticipated or the Warriors wouldn't follow a 67 win and title season with 73 fucking wins and probably another title.
Agreed completely. Guy makes it to the Finals in his first 2 seasons back in Cleveland. Just happens to go up against a team that completely outdo them in match ups. Doesn't help that they had arguabley one of the greatest seasons of all time this year either.
>Doesn't help that they had arguabley one of the greatest seasons of all time this year either.\n\n73 - 9. There's no argument about whether this was one of the greatest.\n
I don't think the warriors work with lebron or westbrook or most not curry superstars. They'd still be good, but only curry would make them a 73 win team
I think its that LeBron has unquestionably been the face of the NBA for a while and this kid comes out of freaking nowhere to not only eclipse him, but take his Cleveland rings.
Yeah. He's gotta be pissed that GSW basically rained on his #ComingHome parade last year.
The Warriors broke the Bulls single season record. Curry is taking winning in the latter end of LeBron's career. As great as LeBron is, I think he'll be in MJ and Kobe's shadow. He's watching his legacy diminish before his eyes. Coming home has not gone as planned
This is the first time i feel like im watching lebron feel threatened by another basketball player on the court. and i love it/hate it as a big lebron fan during the dark days between we believe and now
All because of one skinny scrappy dude with funny Under Armours :D
You think so? I think Lebron was just mad. Which is surprising because Lebron rarely blows up.
Steph makes Lebron super insecure it's hilarious 
Do you blame him? I would hate most of the guys on the warriors too if they took title chances from you in back to back seasons. Its not over yet but its basically over. 
No I agree. It's the first time it spilled out but that was a menacing convo those two were having on the court. Completely out of character for bron. 
I mean Ayesha over there doing her mom of the year shit, steph draining 3's and winning ships, dominating the male nurse shoe market, why wouldn't Lebron be pissed? He hand picked this team and still can't win\n\nEdit: Show to shoe because I was drunk \xf0\x9f\x99\x83

you got my hopes up, dick
Seriously though did the Warriors throw game 3 just so they could win this one at home?
I said that after game 3 and was immediately down voted. 
I think they've lost Game 3 in most 7 game series under Kerr. It's a thing.
LeBron was acting so smug after game 3 I'm glad he got his ass handed to him.
lol don't even cite his stats. his obvious stat padding makes everything he did in the last minute just bs.
He had so many chances to tear into the paint and take over but chose to pass instead. The numbers might be nice and all but could have been so much more effective 
Yes.  They want to have the riots at home this year.
Can't really riot at oracle. We'd flood out into... a parking lot.
That's LA bruh
A bunch of rioters will run into O.Co then immediately run out screaming "Someone already fucked that place up! What do we do now?!?!"

That's what he gets for that wanna be AI step over
Yeah, Draymond just caught Lebron's balls head-first, that's all. 
Because he was trying to get up and get back into play, which LeBron was preventing being a dick.
He could've easily walked around in a step. He was going out of his way
AI did it when he was balling out of control, LeBron did it away from the ball just to be an asshole.
When he was losing. You gotta back up a move that big with your game
The Warriors' ability to contain Lebron tonight was exceptional!\n\nHe even lost his temper!\n\nSeriously though, Golden State did an amazing job of limiting Lebron's effectiveness on offense tonight.
LeBron is one of the players that can get away with murder on the court simply because he's LeBron. It's hilarious
they didnt call fouls on warriors also. It was called evenly on both side. The referees were equal on both sides. 
LET THE BOYS PLAY ^^^unless ^^^we ^^^need ^^^free ^^^throws
Did you miss the blatant foul on Iggy at the end of the half? Don't blame the refs, your team lost. 
Your fries are ready for that salt now...
Even more amazing was him losing during an ACTIVE play. The ball was live.
Lebron shouldn't be trying to play mind games with Green. 
Green is like an Internet troll yell at him and he grows stronger off of your hatred
Watching Draymond Green and LeBron James jawing at and getting in each others faces is like watching humanity\xe2\x80\x99s version of two big ass Bighorn Sheep ramming their heads against each other on Animal Planet.
LBJ trying to act tough with that step over bullshit.
i would laugh is Green move up quickly and hit James in the balls during that move. it might start a fight
Green is doing that thing that some bars do where you drink the beers of the world and you get a t-shirt or something. Except it's Balls Of The NBA and he wins the ability to breath with his mouth closed if he touches all of them during regulation. 
*holy fuck*
This might seriously be the funniest goddamn thing I have ever read on Reddit, lmao

So who fucking won, the 6 year old or the 8 year old?
IMO it's why they lose. They get down and frustrated and he bursts or whines instead of sitting on the huddle and yelling at HIS team and HIS guys to step it up instead of bitching about EVERYTHiNG ELSE! Be a fucking leader!

Bruh stay away from social media and sports talk shows for a day, be with your family, read a book. Just don't let it get to you man.
Don't go near open windows in skyscrapers or large bodies of water.
Reading your comment history from during the game was such a rollercoaster of emotions
It really was.\n\nIt legitimately looked like we could win it there in the 3rd.
Shit can I get in on that, too?
I call next
Fuck yall. If anyone's getting stabbed here, it's gonna be me first
Ok wait pls, let me sharpen my blade.
I'm a Raiders fan, let me handle this.

No way the Cavs win three straight, especially two in Oracle. 
Lil B we need you. Curse these gods of basketball. You're our only hope.
This is blasphemy Lil B would never do that, he's from the bay!
Sorry bro, Lil B is a Bay Area native. That said, the Cleveland sports curse might be stronger than the based god curse 
I don't know what Cleveland did to get that curse but they probably deserved it. 
The Cleveland curse is older than Lil B himself. 
The Cleveland curse is ancient, everyone knows this. 
About that...
Holding my breath
WELL IVE NEVER BEEN SO HAPPY TO BE SO WRONG
Yup
Apologize
IT HAPPENED FAM
Leave it to Cleveland to lose it at home, though.
again
Yea not to count out Cavs but 2 in Oracle? Good luck.

LeBron post game interview: "I said I was going to win a ring for the land... That\'s why I\'m taking my talents to Oakland"
we don't want him
It's not dumb. Adding Lebron would most likely ruin the Warriors dynamic.
No thank you.\n\nUnless he wants to play for the Raiders
49ers fan here. I'll take him.
no thanks, we already have one insufferable man child on our team.\n\n#AND I FUCKING LOVE DRAYMOND
Draymond keeps #23
Lebron played for the Oakland Soldiers AAU team as a teenager. He can take Harrison's money and we can pretend that it's a homecoming.
I thought it was win a ring for the And
And Varajao 
oh god...
Nuh uh don't you bring that Based God Obeah down on us
He would remove since lil b is from the bay
Part of his contract would be he is required to play lil B In a game of 21
After getting into it with Green and Curry? Not a chance. No room for hero ball on that squad.
He did that when the rest of his team was being trash. There were atleast 3 Cav players in double digits before LeBron, and Love was playing well too. Until the fourth quarter, when its all about me. The difference is someone on GSW had to step up, vs tonight where it was neck and neck most of the game UNTIL cavs started iso'ing.
Hero ball is fine if you win haha. Hero ball doesn't look so good when your iso's result in 7 minutes without making a FG in the 4th quarter.
Sports are about winning. Winning depends on the result. So yes, I am. Enjoy your high horse, which would probably come last at the Belmont Stakes. 
dont worry, i wouldn't want him on our team anyways is what I was getting at.
People who have been warriors fans for the past 2 years think they're basketball masterminds. This sub has been atrocious lately.
I actually 100% agree. It would be poison to our team. Let's forget about his ego butting heads with Kerr's plays, he would hurt our chemistry. He is too much the blaming type to gel with the Warriors
honestly why would you? they just won 73 and are about to win back to back, why would you add a superstar that inherently changes the chemistry of the team?
your mind amazes me
He can get his minutes as a 6th man. 
Yeah, if Iggy leaves to get paid LeBron would be a decent replacement. Needs to work on his three though.
It's gone full circle. Iggy is no longer the poor man's Lebron and LeBron is the poor man's Iggy.
Kerr -  Guys, keep thompson down. Hes smashing us in rebounds and energy on the paint. Cant afford to let him continue playing like this. We have to shut him down!\n\n\nLue -  Dw Kerr i got this. Yo Tristan, come, take a seat. 
Thompson was actually in the game when warriors had their biggest offensive rebounds. He was just gassed because he was playing all quarter where as Dray and Barnes had some time to sit before the 4th.
Tyron Lue constantly looks like he just walked into a room where everyone is laughing at a joke that he didn't hear\n\n
so GS gave away game 3 to win at home right?
thats what i was hoping for, always sucks doing a trophy presentation away
But how else is Cleveland going to see a championship?
TV, just like every year for every sport ever.
Come on, man. Cleveland has already seen a [championship](http://media.gettyimages.com/photos/members-of-the-golden-state-warriors-gather-after-winning-the-nba-picture-id477383208).
Savage.
I reckon GSW didn't want to set off a riot by beating them at their home, again.
I said that in the last game thread I had -40 karma on that comment. 
The butthurt runs deep my friend
Ahh you see, when you say something positive about the losing team in the PGT you get downvoted. Hope this helps.\n\n\nGo Warriors!

Kevin Love is undefeated in games his team wins.
Hug if true.

You noticed him too? Glad i wasnt the only one. I thought i saw a hippo on the court.
Yeah it's because he's fat.
are you fat
Mmmm yes let the butthurt flow through.

they raided our subreddit already haha
All those tears shrunk his shirt.
I may have opted out of wearing the shirt if I was him
LeBron was trying to get Draymond to commit a flagrant foul. 
What do I have to do to get a double technical around here?\n-Lebron to ref
Don't see why he was in Curry's face then. Lebron just seemed mad.
Yeah. 
Tonight, a bunch of LeBron haters became Draymond Green lovers
/r/nba still hates Green, but maybe less
I wouldn't say I'm a Draymond lover but definitely less of a hater. I just love seeing him not get intimidated by LeBron in the least
Varejao deserves a statue outside of the Oracle arena for his hustle. He won us the game.
3 offensive rebounds and a shit ton of hustle/heart in a minute or so of game time... Damn impressive
You're an idiot if you can't recognize the huge momentum swing caused by Varejao's hustle.
Ripples create waves my friend
Kevin love deserves a statue in front of oracle for letting Varejao work his ass all night
He must lead the league in fouls given/drawn per minute though.\n\nDamn.
Best 1 minute of the finals by any player. 
A 60 second assassin.
Don't understand the boos when he was cut from the team
Cleveland fans are the real bandwagoners
Did you see that crowd? What else do you expect from them?
Just mob mentality. No logic in the booing
Cavs were pretty good for a lot of Anderson's career there. They had 4 losing seasons in his time there. I don't like them booing him, but still it's not like Andy dealt with terrible circumstances his whole time in Cleveland.
It's the realisation that he's going to get a ring before the Cavs do... The fans are almost as butthurt as Lebron seems to be
Before Game 1 of the Finals, he was already a champion.
It's in the rule book somewhere. If you have a certain amount of games on a team in one season and are traded away/cut before the end of it and they win, you're entitled to a ring. The magic number was like 32 or something
All series long I've wanted to see Varejao play and dominate his old team.  Sure, it was only against Kevin Love, but it was still satisfying to watch.  
That was just the right amount of Klove shade. 
Those offensive rebounds. Holy shit.
Chin up Cavs fans, at least you get free tacos.
Everyone gets free tacos, even the GSW fans lol
Ya, because of the Cavs!!

Kevin Love is no longer undefeated in the playoffs. It's over.
What a dynasty
Better than the Showtime Lakers
inside joke to his dad, but... media loves to create controversy.
Draymonds effort is some Rodman level shit\n
When people talk who would win, Jordan Bulls or Curry Warriors... that's the matchup I wish we could see the most. Sure, seeing Jordan and Pippen guarding Curry and Klay would be epic. But the main attraction would absolutely be Rodman vs Dray. It would be fucking amazing. 
Can anyone for a sec look what LeBron did at the end of the game. It shouldn't go unnoticed. Down 10 and 4 straight positions, should I take a three or pass to an open man for a three? Nope drive it and pad my stats 4 straight plays to not even try to come back. It's pathetic. He choked but of course they'll look at his stats and say HERP DERP HE NEEDS HELP. 
Hoping the best FT shooting back court in the league would miss enough for his layups to tie the game up with less than a minute and no timeouts remaining... yea the math doesn't add up.
Why doesn't he just do that when the game is getting out of hand? He realistically can score when he really wants to. I just don't get it. I know I don't play against anyone near the same level as an NBA player but if I'm the best guy on the court and we need a bucket in taking that shit to the hole. He does that better than anyone. So frustrating to watch as a LeBron fan.
I honestly don't know. Does he get scared or something. It's so frustrating to watch and pisses me off. Watching kobe for my whole life then LeBron just makes me dislike so much. His ability to shoot really hurts him and when he drives he gets doubled. But I feel he can always drive but he shys away. When it doesn't work for him he gets afraid of missing and doesn't take over. Not right 
You just can't call yourself the best in the game and be afraid to take the big shots.
Nah the warriors were letting him get anything he wanted inside at the end.  They just didn't want 3s or fouls because they knew they wouldn't choke the long game.
Can I say that perhaps LeBron has Jordan's eye for roster building?
LeBron used to take over games and had a pretty reliable 3 pointer when called upon. Nowadays his accuracy from downtown is atrocious! When did he lose that skill? 
His shot was always bad. His form is terrible so it's inconsistent. He practiced it a lot when he was younger because he wanted to play pretty. He doesn't shoot nearly as much anymore and his jank ass form isn't one that will let you shoot well unless you're shooting it all the time.
When he left Miami he changed. His shot was never great but this is worse than it's ever been. 
When curry absorbed it. That's how he has all the threes.
Kerr disrespecting my man Speights with only 6 seconds of play time.\n\nHe needs at least 30 seconds to get an OREB and a 3
Don't forget the 2 fouls as well.
Lebron playing the "I\'m a good guy, green went too far" card 
Wait, really? \n\nThe fuck did Green do? 
Apparently Green said something disrespectful. Broussard is saying he called Lebron a bitch.
Well...\n\n\nHe is
bitch move, leave that shit on the court. 
Honest, I don't mind that at the start but don't pull that shit when the game is almost over and your team is losing. Just shows frustration more than competition.

draymond might be unlikeable but you want him on your team\n\nhe\'s always willing to fight and when you\'re in games like this you need a fighter\n\n[if too many guys just back down and let guys like james literally walk over or on them then that\'s how you get disrespected and teams will physically intimidate you](https://i.imgur.com/5TCW02F.png)\n\nif you don\'t have a guy like green then cleveland probably fights back in this fourth and maybe wins\n\ndon\'t like green but he\'s a gamer at least, regardless of his attitude\n\njust look at him doing anything he can with 3 mins left to keep that ball out of the net and out of cleveland\'s hands\n\nthat\'s how you win championships\n\nthe crowd doesn\'t intimidate him it just amps him up more and drives him to play harder and piss everyone in the arena off\n\nyou gotta have fighters on your team that are going to get in people\'s faces or else it\'s gonna be open season on your teammates and you\'re gonna get rolled and knocked around when it matters\n\n[kerr knew that and that\'s why he publicly called his team "soft" because it\'s true and he knew they needed to hear it.](http://espn.go.com/nba/playoffs/2016/story/_/id/16105116/nba-playoffs-2016-golden-state-warriors-soft) draymond said curry got \'punked\' last game and he was right and look how curry played tonight. remember green flippin his shit last game on the bench? that\'s how he is and it\'s a good thing. everyone else just dejected and taking a beating without getting angry about it. not green tho.\n\nhe looked out of control doing it last game but now you know that it was the right thing to do. that\'s how sports can be sometimes.
He's Rodman with offense. 
I read this like it was slam poetry 
Did you see him win the stare off with LeBron on the tip. What a man.
plus SO smart to not get a tech when lebron was crumbling and getting pissed in his face! ITS OVA!
LeBron really didn't handle the last few minutes of game time with any amount of grace. Looked almost out of control during that Dray interaction.
There's a reason he garnered Kobe's respect. He's a competitor to the death. 
[What Kobe thinks of these Cavs](http://i.imgur.com/i1Ok6qN.gifv)
This just makes me angry we never got the Kobe-Lebron finals , the trash talking alone, from kobe , would've made for so many soundbites 
Meh... Kobe has the utmost respect for Bron (though I'm sure he's glad he has fewer than 5).\n\nActually, come to think of it, maybe in '09 it'd have been great when LeBron was anointed best player in the league while Kobe was putting up 34-6-6 on 63% TS% (and yes I remember somehow LeBron was better in the ECF, but I'm sure Kobe felt disrespected anyways).
Re: Game 7, here are the words from his own mouth:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvnauVtNA6Q\n\nI\'m inclined to agree with him. Kobe averaged 35.4 ppg that season. I distinctly remember what our offensive strategy was in that series. We were actually running Kwame post ups. Slow the game down. As a result? 28 ppg in that series. In wins? 23.3 ppg, on 21.7 used possessions (FGA + FT/2). In losses? 31 ppg, on 25.5 used possesions.\n\nIn Game 4, when they made the  comeback? It was a team effort.\n\nI know I\'m not going to change your mind. Been on the internet long enough. But I remember this game clearly. And I don\'t think he "gave up": he made a concerted effort to get the ball to his teammates, and they failed. He scored 50 ppg, including 12 in OT, the previous game, and they still lost. Should he have taken over and see what happens? In retrospect, it\'d have been better, sure. Hindsight is 20/20. Does that mean he "gave up"? I don\'t see it.\n\n\n---\n\nThe rest of your post (regarding LeBron vs. Kobe etc.) is so loaded that I\'d spend hours unpacking it just to address it properly. I\'ll pass on that one. We have our beliefs on that and we\'re not going to change our minds.\n
Kobe respects a lot of people, just not on the court; remember he even called that ref a "bundle of sticks" ?
He's the enforcer. He'll absorb all the hate and criticism to deflect it from his teammates. Every team needs that. 
You're lying if you say the Nuggets would not benefit from a Draymond Green.
every team would benefit from a draymond green.
And he'll also act as the muscle so his team doesn't get intimidated by someone like LeBron. A team like GSW who're otherwise smaller and mostly good guys needs Green. 
He's BatMan!\n
Rodman 2.0
better 
Not only that, but he's an amazing player. 1st All NBA Defense and 2nd All NBA, plus carrying the team emotionally. Amazing.
Draymond FMVP?
I wish someone would've stepped up for him when shit went down though.
he don't need someone to step up tho. the enforcer has a heart of ice. when shit hits the fan its just a party with confetti for draymond.
Yup. It was obvious Lebron was tryina bait him and anyone else would've fallen for that. The judo take down, no foul, AND the step-over? But Green was cold as fucking ice. Not only does he *remain in the game and get the rebound, afterwards he only gets in Lebron's face, has a few words, and just walks away*. Like holy shit, to have the presence of mind to just *walk away* and not do something that'd get him a flagrant or a tech.
Disrespectful to TT to have him on the bench in the 4th. Lue has no fucking clue 
\xf0\x9f\x97\xa1\xf0\x9f\x94\xab
Lebron with the garbage time 6 points lol.\nGotta pad those stats
Score 3s. The warriors were gonna give him all the layups in the world and he kept taking them.
twos were worthless. The warriors were making their free throws so the cavs needed threes. Instead he was taking twos that the warriors wanted him to take.
Who loved LeStatPad at the end? 
i mean, what was he going to do, LeBrick some 3s? He's gotta fix that jump this off season.
He had it in Miami somewhat. If he just gets back to that point it'll make a big difference.
You know Draymond said something personal like "Space Jam 2 is gonna suck"
How are there 218 comments in here when it was posted "just now"
DOMINATE POST GAME
Welcome to reddit.
We all have no life 
Ball is life 
Not sure what was more embarrassing, the Cavs offense or LeBron acting like a total bitch.
That was crazy. Lebron is usually so calm with that. He started that by trying to be Allen Iverson to Draymond's Lue.
When he was acting like a bitch last game blocking Currys lay up after the play was dead everyone on here was riding his nuts. 
Difference between "acting like a bitch" and "showing who\'s boss" is whether you\'re winning or losing. 
LeBron being a bitch isn't new behavior for him
Looked like Dray took his candy and Bron Bron had to cry about it
Everyone loses, and no one would blame Lebron for losing to a better team, but acting that petty is all on him 
Completely irrelevant response.
Supersonics logic
ahh yes lets make this about Fuck Draymond
I hate Draymond as much as anyone, but that is ridiculous. Lebron was a bitch tonight
I think Dray just knew if he picked up more techs he'd be in trouble. He got hotheaded but cooled off when he remembered the possible incoming suspension. 
It's all about composure man. And I don't know how this happened but *Draymond Green* kept his...that's the real story here. Like whoa
did you miss him fouling steph when the game was basically over and then having the nerve to jaw back? or when he tried to step over green ,green obviously taking exception and then lets green jump over him for the rebound right afterwards, there's a thin line between being pissed at losing and using that to play better, and letting it get to you, and it may be one of those things where ,we're looking at it more closely b/c he just lost in the finals instead of another game, but  it still looked REALLY bad when it seemed like the other players had calmed down *mostly* 
I actually get it. Must be so frustrating to have gone back to Cleveland, assembled your own hand-picked team, and still fallen short in consecutive years. Any competitive person would be extremely frustrated in his situation. 
It is but he should be looking in the mirror , getting him and Green or Curry thrown out is not going to help the Cavs turn this around 
Yeah, this is a rare game where his fit throwing was painfully obvious from the start. 
As someone said, James can step over other people without retaliation, but when its a better team, that shit doesn't fly. Kudos to Green not decking him in the face. 
No one would blame Lebron losing to a better team\n\nHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
sadly this is the case. People will always make excuses for Lebron not winning in the finals - blaming his teammates, his coach, anything but his own play.
I don't understand this argument at all. We must be following different conversations about him. Lebron has been raked over the coals for losing finals no matter how well he's played.
LeBron gets more shit than any athlete in any sport. 
You're right. I'm a Lebron fan and make excuses for him a lot. But generally I'd say outside of us Lebron apologists people are irrationally hard on him. There's really only so much one man can do.
I've seen people blaming Lebron for assembling a team whose talents don't complement each other very well compared to GS but that itself shows most people believe GS is a better team. Lebron the player is still good, Lebron the GM needs to retire for a few years 
He's basically top 5 all time in NBA Finals PTS/AST/REB and people are already defining his legacy as choking in the finals. If Lebron doesn't win the finals he will be blamed no matter how sound your logic may be.
This shit isn't doing anything for his legacy. Another year another loss isn't some awesome track record.
Can't tell if you're being sarcastic or not. Stacking your team with three all-stars and going through the weaksauce east is not an accomplishment.
In a one team Eastern Conference it's impressive but not as impressive as if he did it in the West. The competition he faced is so staggeringly bad compared to the West.
I can see the Pistons beating the Rockets but IMO the Blazers were a better team than the Hawks in the playoffs. the Hawks are absolute trash in the playoffs, can't even win a single game against the Cavs. 
> No ~~one~~rational person would blame Lebron for losing to a better team\n\nBetter? \n
That's a perfect summary of his entire career excluding 2011.
The LeBron hate right now is ridiculous. 24 hours ago, people were all over his dick, now it's a full on 180. r/NBA likes to rip Skip Bayless and sports media, but the truth is most people can't critically think for themselves after a game and need a pushed storyline.
Or maybe.....just mayyyyybe....when gsw wins, all the gsw fans come out to gloat....and when the cavs won, all the cavs fans came out to gloat. Shocking.
That "fight" with Draymond was hilarious
Sure the loss was embarassing, but Lebron acting like a punk ass bitch was straight up disgraceful. You're repping your city, and you can't control your emotions when you're losing? That last pull on curry was completely uncalled for. 
Every (good) NBA player blocks shots after the whistle. Ever since KG started that shit. It's nothing new. 
Sorry gotta do it.  2-5 or 2 for 7
Exactly, you still have time, why the fuck was he worried about jawing and then going for two each possession...
The Warriors really got to him this series 
Draymond really got into his head tonight.
Somewhere Lance Stephenson is worshipping his personal Dray shrine.
I'm just waiting for the inevitable Dray/Delly knife fight at halftime in game 6
So, you've got the Cavs winning @Oracle? Bold move, cotton. 
Bogut v Delly in a game of knifey/spoony. 
You think the cavs are gonna win a road game?
no... they can't
Game 6? That's a long wait for a train don't come.
Assuming game 6 even happens now.
lol there won't be one
Yeah, what? This is over Monday.
The Cavs need to defeat the monstars to retrieve Lebron's jumpshot
Could you imagine if the desperation ever got there?\n\nLike Lebron is actually in the locker room post game tonight talking to the starters.\n\n"I know this sounds crazy but [the answer was in the meme](http://imgur.com/rBdtY6c) all along. will you guys get into my Kia with me and drive to charlotte and find a way to get that [Secret Stuff](http://8328-presscdn-0-65.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/lebrons-secret-stuff.jpeg)?\n\n*Lebron & friends weekend adventure before game 5*
He was quite the chatty cathy towards the end.
It's so rare to see Lebron get this heated.
Heated...get it? 
Would love to listen what he said to Steph
Probably about how salty this game tasted. 
I love the stink face Steph gave him like "dude, why are you even talking shit when you\'re down by almost double digits with less than a minute to go."
My money's still on LeBron in a fight tho... 
And you\'re mad I\'m complaining to the refs? YOU Lebron James?!
Steph had the upper hand and the lead *and* the stink face. You know Lebron is gonna be in the shower reliving that confrontation over and over for years. 
Gonna be fun to watch fans like you when Steph goes on to win 4 or 5 rings while Lebron sits at 2
Yeah a whole 2... Wait Curry's catching up! Oh no!
Money isn't everything.
Not for long
Why? 
Perhaps you have forgotten what an arrogant prick he was in Miami and talking about how many finals he was going to win in a row? Or when he quit on his team vs Dallas in the finals or even tonight when he scores 4 points in the first half or vs the Spurs when he is getting crushed in a series and walks around in post games saying "I am still the best player in the world that is why I am confident we can win this" Sorry if Lebron is going to act like the best he needs to prove it not act like a bitch every time a call goes against him and disappear for entire halves of finals games.
I felt that way about his 2007 loss. He's obviously a great player, but he's done this to himself. Predicts a million titles in Miami. Bounces when Wade and Bosh start slowing down. Forms another super team with younger players. Hand picks his teammates and coach. Not to mention his phases of insane arrogance. I can't feel sorry for him. 
yes
God I am cracking up reading this subthread.
Curry for 3
I think I saw LeBron (on the replay where we can see Stephs face clearly and the side of Lebrons) say "you\'re soft" and steph said something like "get outta here man"
So soft that he scored 38 and they have a 3-1 series lead. \n\n
I loveed when everyone started chanting "Draymond sucks". He thrives on that kinda thing. It was no surprise when he hulked out right after and started blocking the shit out of everything LeBron came at him with.
I guess every super hero needs his theme music
I  kept waiting for him to rip his jersey off and sue Gawker for all of the monies. 
It didn't even phase him. \n\nHell he even went to contest Lebron's missed dunk, no fucks given.
I love it when guys do that, especially against people like Lebron.  You have to respect someone who tries to play good defense even when it means asking to get posterized.
Seriously he is the prime example of haters feeding someone to do their best. 
Haters make Dray famous
He's an msu alum. He feeds of disrespekt.
Man, those State Farm Kevin Love commercials sure did disappear fast 
BABY DAME DOLLA HERE TRAILBLAZING DIMES EVERYWHERE
TL;DR: Draymond talks shit; backs it up.
Nothing better than see LeBron be  such a cry baby. And then lose.
I'm not sure I want Space Jam 2 featuring LeBron.
I want Kobe
If the Warriors win it all then I will eat a bowl of cereal and post proof.
Is it just me or does Lue just look hella lost all the time haha? Like not even hating dude just seems genuinely perplexed like he got kidnapped and placed on an NBA floor with no idea how he got there
[Kerr's reaction to Lue's coaching](https://premium.wpmudev.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/nicolas-cage-laughing.gif)
I don\'t care whether people think this is "playoff basketball", the standard of refereeing is awful. JVG said it well, it\'s not letting them play, it\'s just not calling fouls. It makes it hard for me to enjoy the game.\n\nAt least they don\'t seem to be favoring a specific team. But it\'s a problem.\n
No, rotating set.
Wasn't as big of a problem as everyone's trying to make it out to be.
I'll agree it was fairly even both ways, I still think not calling fouls benefits the worse team though.
LeBron got away with bloody murder.\n\nEdit: LeBron's stepover would have been a technical if Green did it.\n\nLeBron smacks Iguodala's hand and there's no call.\n\nLeBron flails his elbows and hits Livingston in the face.. No call. Smh.
I completely disagree. I loved it.
Agreed, I long for physical play in the NBA.
I\'m with x-man, I don\'t give a fuck about either of these teams, but I think fans, "NBA" fans, deserve better basketball than what we saw tonight as a result of the officiating. It was a shit show man.\n\nMy girlfriend who doesn\'t know dick about basketball/sports said it best tonight: "Why are we still watching this sweaty man pileup?"
Right there with you. Great physical basketball. Calls were missed on both sides but for the most part, the refs allowed tough play.
Typically I would be more likely to agree with you but, this game seemed to go overboard with bad non-calls that favored Cleveland for about 3 quarters and then GSW in the 4th. Very weird and annoying.
I like free-flowing basketball, but it just seems a bit much to me. I agree with a bit of leniency on ticky-tacky fouls, but I'm talking about a lot of obvious fouls that just aren't being called.\n\nThere's a fine line between free-flowing and dangerous due to a lack of refereeing. I dunno if we'll get to dangerous, but the referees are letting people get away with too much, in my opinion.
Agreed. Reminds me of the blacktop days where we were fouling every possession, but too prideful to call anything. 
[No blood no foul](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/de2Rv5eijvA/maxresdefault.jpg)
For real. I didn't enjoy watching any part of this game. Jus threw my hands up in disbelief the whole time. I want to love the finals but I can't.
I enjoyed the game, but some of the shit they were allowing was dangerous and it seemed it just kept escalating. Glad no one got hurt. 
Yeah, there was a stretch in the 3rd where I was honestly wondering if the refs had lost their whistles. Both teams kept escalating the contact, and still nothing. The players committing the would-be-fouls even looked shocked when they weren't called. Guys would steal the ball, look around for the whistle, and then play on, incredulous.
The problem isn't even missing calls.  It's calling certain things tight and then missing the calls.  The players need some expectation for how the game is going to be called, and in this game the refs were calling tickytack shit and not calling harder fouls.  You simply can't have that.\n\nAlso, can someone explain how that Bogut alley-oop wasn't a shooting foul?  I don't understand how that was a possible outcome in that situation.  Like, the NBA refereeing processes should not have allowed that.  It was called a foul, on a very clear alley-oop interrupted by the called foul, but then wasn't calling a shooting foul.  That's breaking process.
It\'s not calling fouls.\n\nKevin Live obviously fouls Andy:\n\n"That\'s a flop! You can\'t call fouls for a flopper!"
I thought that was one of the most ridiculous and biased things I've heard a commentator say...\n\nHe clearly pushed him down. It's not a foul just because he has a history? That's not how it works.
He's been like that for the last two finals. Him and MJax are idiots. 
He also said "Lebron needs to shoot more 3\'s and jumpers in order to win" Might be better off just watching these games on mute to be honest I about fell out of my chair when he said that, the guy is struggling to score from 10 feet away and you want to move him out of his comfort zone?
He actually said "LeBron needs to take and make" those outside shots. The secret this whole time is that LeBron just needs to start making shots! How did LeBron and Lue not notice this yet? \n\nI usually love JVG but he\'s been off this series.
He got called out on it by the other commentator.\n\nYou could hear it in his voice that he knew he was wrong. Anyone with an ego doubles down in that situation though so he didn't recant.
Watching Varejao has been fascinating for me. A bad flopper will feel contact and then embellish the reaction. A good flopper, and Varejao is a very good flopper, anticipates when contact is about to be made, and sets himself up to flop so it looks like a natural reaction.\n\nIn that play, he knows Kevin Love is going to push him. He could have stood his ground there, you just take that extra stabalizing step when you\'re pushed. But he decides early "when Love pushes me I\'m gonna fall", so you see his (I don\'t remember, left or right) foot kind of freeze and not move, so his body just falls over naturally without that foot placed in a stabilizing position.\n\nFrom Love\'s perspective, he\'s thinking "I\'m gonna push Varejao just a little bit to move him out of the way to clear the lane." Maybe he should realize Varejao is gonna flop on the play, but he doesn\'t, so you see Love also falls on the play too, he wasn\'t expecting Varejao to fall over when he pushes him. And then he gets mad when the foul is called, "I barely touched him!". Well true, but you did touch him, you clearly pushed him. Varejao is simply thinking one step ahead of his opponent to draw the foul. \n\nNow what I would love to see is for the "fouler" to realize he is being guarded by Varejao, and in those situations where it is normal to put a little contact on the player, just lay off completely. Like if I were Kevin Love during that play, I would move towards Varejao making it seem like I\'m about to push him, but at the last second lay off completely and not touch him at all. I don\'t know if that happens ever, but it would be interesting to see what Varejao does in that situation. Does he flop? Does he freeze up and do nothing? Does he roll with it and use the space to make a move? Because it seems like Varejao commits so early in the play to flopping, I don\'t know if he can cancel it on the fly if his man were to try to fake the contact.
that was totally a foul, van gundy was holding varejo's rep to a higher degree than the actual play.  varejo has always been a flopper, but in that play in particular he was clearly pushed by love
Lebron chooses to pad his stats with layups instead of working for 3s to end the game.
This made absolutely no sense whatsoever. You're in a position where only quick threes can potentially get you back in the game, but no, LeBron just doesn't believe in math I guess. 
The only math Lebron believes in is statistics.
lbj has always chased stats.
he's a notorious stat watcher. surprised he didn't go for an assist to get the triple double.
Yeah, what the hell was that? They desperately needed three pointers and instead he kept getting easy layups...which is exactly what the warriors wanted with curry and klay on the floor. It would be a long shot, but that game was still winnable.
I\'m not sure about what 3 there were alot of them\n\n\nDam Klay such shade lol 
Thanks for the tacos for the stolen game. Everyone can hit up Taco Bell now.    \nhttps://www.tacobell.com/StealATaco
June 21st??? The fuck is that shit?? 
First time in his career I've seen Lebron 'crack' like this.  Just the other day he was giving a post game interview and everyone was praising how much he's matured since coming into the league.  Then you have a game like this where he seemed to lose it mentally.  \n\n\nHe's playing the team game.  Letting his teammates take shots.  There was a time when we'd see him takeover.. demand the ball.. put it all on his shoulders.  He's not doing that anymore.  I'd like to think he's just staying committed to playing team basketball.  Although part of me thinks he's just not that good anymore to take over and drop 45 on people.  
You didn't see the finals vs the Mavs???
He just checked out that series. This series you can see it getting to him.
his jumper isn't consistent enough to do that. It started declining in the last year in Miami and we are seeing the aftereffects now.\n
How does that work? He had a 30% jumper for years. Loses to the mavs with Miami, gets into the paint, beats OKC, then vs the Spurs, his jumper showed up. Now, 2 years in a row it's gotten worse.\nDoes he just not practice that? Defenses getting smarter?
I think his form is terrible so he has to shoot a ton to be decent with it. Since he's committed to the paint post 2011 besides that run in 2013 playoffs he's never shot well.\n\n
The way the Cavs played in the first half, I thought they were going to run away with another one and make this a best-of-three series for the championship. But Golden State completely turned the tables on that idea - or, I think more accurately - the Cavs turned them on themselves. Cleveland\xe2\x80\x99s offense stagnated in the second half - especially in the 4th, where it seemed like there was zero ball/off-ball player movement, and A LOT of ISO plays for Kyrie and Bron (reminded me of the playoff Raptors in certain stages- I was left wondering, does this team even run plays?). This was all evidenced by the fact that at one point in the 4th, the Cavs went without a FG for almost seven minutes. Hard to beat a team of GS\xe2\x80\x99s calibre when that happens, whether at home or not. \n\nBelieve it or not, Cavs actually shot a higher percentage than GS in the second half, but they lost because of that cold stretch and that they only made one three pointer after half (compared to ~8 for GS). The fact the Warriors set an NBA-finals record with 17 3PM hurt Cleveland as well.\n\nAnyway, I was hoping Cleveland would win this one so that we would be *guaranteed* to delay the start of the offseason a bit longer. But I think now the repeat is pretty much a done deal (considering how hard GS is to beat at home, and that no team has ever recovered from a 3-1 deficit in the NBA finals). Nice to finally watch a competitive Finals game, though. The previous three games were complete duds (from a neutral fan\xe2\x80\x99s view) but at least this one was watchable and competitive through the 4th q - basically all I was hoping for at this point!\n\nEdit: added sentence about Warriors setting NBA Finals single game 3PM team record.
How can you blame Kyrie's isos though, it was the only source of points on that team. 
Lol did you pre type this up
It was the 2nd comment in, and we're now 6 minutes in with over 800. I'd say so. \n\nI-- I mean-- Big if true.
That's just professionalism man. Like reporters who work on deadline.
It's all about that All The Right Type training. Get your WPM crazy high
I could tell you, but it'll cost you Amir Johnson and tree fiddy.
I feel like the Warriors are the most mentally tough team in the league. You can look at the Western Conference Finals as example A, but even in tonight's game they showed resolve and played hard and *smart* through the fourth, even while the Cavaliers were playing amazing basketball. \n
During the OKC series, GS just kept taking haymaker after haymaker, but they never deviated from the game plan, along with a bit of luck.
There's no shame in losing to the Warriors, but the Cavs gave this game away. They went to iso ball in the 4th when Kyrie and Lebron were exhausted, which makes no sense. Kerr got his guys rest, even when it meant playing poor options, and it worked out in crunch time. Cavs had to win this one and they blew it, so frustrating. 
Lol @ "poor options", on a 73-9 team. The Warriors are better, period.
I mean that's what happens against the Warriors. We did it too. Warriors play stupid hard D in the 4th forcing you to go ISO. Of course it's partly Kyrie and Lebron's fault for going ISO glory mode but I think the Warriors have a hand in it too. I mean we lost 3 in a row because we were forced to ISO. I might be wrong but that's what I believe.
I mean props to Golden State for their D too. Cavs could've played better but they only had a 2 point lead in one point in the 4th
JVG or Jackson pointed it out at the start of the 4th. Both Lebron and Kyrie were in, while Curry was getting rest.
First thing cavs did after losing was go in the locker room and watch replays of bron getting hit in the nuts?\n
https://twitter.com/vinephilly/status/741475547742638080
what did lebron and curry say to each other at the end?!
It's gonna be funny if Steph wins it at the Oracle with his 'Chef' shoes and shuts everyone up :')
I think Curry will embrace the shoe memes and turn them into a positive like Drake did w/ hotline bling 
Well Cavs fans, there's always next year to lose in the finals. 
Bron: Y'all think y'all got an open spot for me next year? \n\n[Curry: Boy if you don't get]( \nhttps://pbs.twimg.com/media/CkpB-5-VAAIxjxa.jpg:small)\n

Cavs fans left the game early to beat the trafic to get home and see who can burn Kevin Love's jersey the fastest
Any Cav fan that blames Love is stupid. He played hard but this series is just not good match up wise at all. 
Not his fault his only job in cleveland is to camp at the 3 point line lol
Lue is so bad lol 
Our 6th man is back! Thanks Kevin!
Actually they did a great job staying in their seats until the last minute.
I found it funny when Oracle had more people watching in Oakland than the Cavs had left in their stadium. Then they panned to the  outside view, and they all were there.
Crazy how the winning team tends to stick around longer\n
Was expecting Heat fans part two. Props Cavs fans!
Heat fans part two got a championship. Part three, as well.
they left early last year but thats none of my business 
I'm a supplanted Heat fan living in the Philly area. Philly fans leave every single game early. Except the Flyers fans.\n\nEvery fanbase has fans that leave early. 
he's saying they never got into the game. i.e. sitting down all game.
Some of them look like they haven't left their seat in years 
Ths Cavs team is a pale imitation of the 2010-14 Heat.
I just don't get the fourth quarter collapse 
Miami played championship defense when it needed to. The Cavs have too many dudes who are straight up defensive liabilities.
Just got word that Lue will bench LeBron after he gave him Vietnam-level PTSD with that step over Dray 
Lue looks terrible in this post game. \n\n"Lue, what did you see in so and so?"\n\n"Fuck if I know.  I gotta look at the tape."

Thanks to **LLL**ebron!
Not the Larriors anymore !
In my head, I pronounce it as Law-riors. But, I can see Low-riors being another pronunciation.   \nFor the IPA efficient:  \n1. [l\xc9\x92-\xc9\xb9i\xc9\x9az] (Law-Riors)  \n2. [lo\xca\x8a-\xc9\xb9i\xc9\x9az] (Low-Riors)  \nEDIT: Maybe [l\xc9\x94-\xc9\xb9i\xc9\x9az] as a potential pronunciation ?  \nEDIT 2: Accidentally removed IPA of #1 and put it in the first edit. Also, I never considered the Larry-ors version. I guess there's that too.
Never again!
Free karma!
Regardless of we were rooting for tonight, I think we can all agree on one thing. \n\n**The refs were absolute trash tonight.**\n\nIt's one thing to call tick tacky fouls or to let the guys play, but it's another to be so incredibly inconsistent that no one playing in or watching the game knows what is or isn't going to draw a whistle. \n\nI'm not passing blame at all, I just feel like games at this stage of the NBA season deserve better officiating than what we received tonight. 
Smith goes right across Iggy's arms on the 3 pointer. No call, tech on Kerr.
What about the foul right before half time? It was bad, but equally bad for both sides. 
Amen
We need a ref lowlight video. It was atrocious.
For real. Not calling fouls is just bad officiating. Ugh. So ugly.
The officiating was fucking unacceptable. It's not like it's going to change. They kind of do what they want. 
https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CkO-iXJUgAAW0dQ.jpg
Anybody notice how the Cavs kinda gave up around the 6 minute mark in the fourth? That was weird. Crowd wasn't in it, players looked very uninterested... Just odd cuz they were only down 5.
Dead legs. No rest. Lue's fault.
This game shows clearly that Lebron cares more about stats padding than winning. Down 9 with 30 seconds left? Better go for the easy 2!
Implying LeBron can make clutch 3's in the finals. 
Barnes earned himself a max, tonight.
been clutch all season, let steph klay and dray do their thing, need to clinch it, barnes was there
As long as its not the Lakers then sure.
I'm starting to like draymond green. dude plays so hard
I'm not blind to all the dirty shit, but when the dude is on your team it's really hard to dislike him because he fucking hates losing.
Every team needs an asshole and he's Golden States. He doesn't give a fuck if you like him, he doesn't give a fuck if the crowd likes him, he doesn't give a flying fuck. He only cared about his team winning and that's why he's invualable, he won't let anyone walk over him and he'll foul you and piss you off to no end as long as it means winning. Dude may not be a sportsman but by God he's got the drive to win and amazing athleticism and that's why even if you don't like him you gotta respect him. This is a guy who won't even back down to LeBron, Draymond does not give a fuck and it's amazing. \n\n\n\n\nPlus he looks like a donkey. 
I watched him all season and never felt he was exceedingly dirty. The Adams thing was embarrassing, but honestly he didn't do stuff like that every night. He's mostly just a guy who plays with great passion, hustle, and intensity. Guys like this are frustrating to play against, but you love them when they're on your team. 
He's definitely a guy that you want on your team. He's a pure heart, energy guy. My only complaint would be that he set some shady screens this year. However, if you're continually getting away with it, why stop?
You\'re a brave man contradicting r/NBA\'s hive-mind. I\'d be willing to bet that within 20 minutes, there will be at least three "Fuck Draymond Green" comments.  
Nah man, you missed the tide turning. That was last week's /r/NBA.
I just can't seem to keep up with the trends
This sub literally switches narrative depending on who wins (Cavs lose, Warriors win = Lebron is a bitch and Draymond isn't). It's pretty bipolar. 
More like the people who like Draymond post more when he does well, and people who dislike him post more when he does poorly. Same with LeBron. Same with every team.
Fuck Draymond Green^played^hard^tonight
Now this i like
Dude is the most important player on the team
People that hate him try to make him out to be a fake(whether its his toughness or his game) but you have yet to see him cower when everything is on the line. He always steps up with his play. 
Seriously misguided if you think he went missing for the whole series. He had a couple bad games  but came through when it mattered. He plays hard every game, you are right.
So basically he went slightly lower than his season average(for the series) after having 2 bad games? You can hate the guy and I see that you do but calling him a spoiled douche is so far from the truth. You can call him a lot of terrible things but spoiled might not exactly be the right words. To each his own.
skill, talent and physically, he always seems to me like a "bootleg Lebron". But what makes him so effective, is that he works hard and he knows his strengths and focuses on that. Also helps that the pieces around him complement him perfectly.\n\nI think he could be a memorable great in the game at the end of his career, especially if this Warrior group stick together for a few more years.
I don't think there's anything fake about him, he's just a dick. 
Almost better than that, he's honest with himself when he does have a bad game, and owns up to it. He doesn't have much of a personal ego, seemingly. BUT Draymond seems to have an ego and arrogancy for the Warriors as a team. It's very interesting.
These fools don't know that Draymond will do literally anything for a win and prove doubters wrong. 
You can't question the guy's passion for the game.  I'd take that over someone phoning in a performance any day.
He's like Matthew Delladova, but actually good at basketball
Don't piss him off either, it just makes his defense better. 
**FUCK...DRAYMOND GREEN** played like a monster and almost got suspended for calling LeBron a little bitch.
2 techs or 1 flagrant
well Lebron isn't little.
[Special delivery for the Cavs](http://imgur.com/JPvPUR5)
Kevin Love is unbeaten in playoff games played in Cleveland, in which he has started.
If only for two days, we can finally not here about the Splash brothers (specifically Curry) looking not so splashy in the Finals.
I still remember when Steph got snubbed from an all star appearance a few years ago. Can't believe how things have changed since then tbh.
Fucking hell. This fully healthy Cavs team was supposed to at least give the Warriors a challenge and potentially win the fuckin' thing. What the hell is this. They gave the game away in the 4th and the ISO heavy tag tea of LeBron and Kyrie is really helping in that regard.\n\nYou'll get one some day Cleveland, just not now.
No, this full healthy Cavs team had a very small chance at giving the Warriors a challenge. After the 7 game series with OKC it was obvious that momentum was going to carry the Warriors all the way through this. Warriors in 5 was a very easy prediction to make. There was no way Cavs were going to win both games in Cleveland and it was very obvious that their Warriors were going to win their first 2 games at home.
And that's the series. Go Indians 
LeBron wants to get one for the land. \n\nLooks like this Cavs squad interpreted it as one win not one ring. 
It\'s all about getting tacos for the land!
Draymond turned Lebron into a raging little boy tonight, looked like he stole Bron Bron's candy.
Hey Cavs fans\n\nhttp://imgur.com/LfT1LnI
lol Cleveland
nope but yours is still the butt of every sports joke and won't win anything for a looooong time. Take this L
atleast we don't have a coach that looks like a fish
Atleast the bucks have a championship.
They still got more rings than Cleveland

Varejao coming back to haunt the Cavs.
Golden State won this game with defense. Period.
Goddamn it. Goddamn it.
Thank You Warriors
All lebron had to do was talk to Guillermo
Lol, t lue bitching about the refs. They were god awful for both sides...
It's not overreacting at this point. It would be a miracle if CLE won 2 in a row at Oracle.
KLove should've played in the final 5 minutes when the Cavs were down nearly 10 points - it's the equivalent of pulling the goalie in hockey.  What they surrender in defense they make up for in offensive firepower.  I agree that he shouldn't have started - but his presence was missed down the stretch.
Kyrie may have been playing ISO in the fourth and taking contested difficult shots, but what else was he going to do? Nobody was cutting or setting off ball screens, LeBron looked like he didn't want to be there which is inexplicable. If you ask me out of the big three Kyrie was the only one who looked genuinely invested in the game right till the end, you could see it on his face. 
Draymond Green did Chernobyl

Man I was getting hype just hoping that LeBron and Draymond Green would get into a fight towards the end.\n\nThen there were words between LeBron and Curry?!?! I was like " no! LEBRON HE\'S JUST A CHILD!"
When LeBron retires with a 2-Shitty Finals record I could see his 30 for 30 in 20 years being named "The King that never Reigned: A LeBron James story"

LeBron shouldn't have fired blatt 
OMG Lebron and Kyrie have never looked more like father and son than they do in this post game presser.
They should have traded Love a few months ago, they could have gotten a good package from say Boston.\n\nNow his value has hit rock bottom, whether LeBron wins a ship with Cavs will solely depend what they likely get with Love. They have the highest payroll in the league and are STARTING J.R and Jefferson. That is a catastrophe.\n\n
Fuck the Cavs.
Lebron is such a great teammate he spent the last 2 minutes padding his stats instead of trying to win \n\nLebron is so weak mentally he didn't attempt a single 3 while they were down and opted to protect his fg%\nOn top of that he didn't pass it to his teammates and took easy layups to pad his fucking stats\nWhat a fucking loser
He had his dumb fans to believe that empty stats.
He's done it his whole fucking career 
Right. But people won't see that when they look at his stats. Pathetic 
He's done this shit his whole fucking career\n\nPeople pull up his performances, he shot 50% though! He had 25 points though!!
After watching kobe no one really understands how maddening lebron is quite like we do
Only one of the two have heart and give it all to win \n
Watching Cleveland fail will never get old :')
Pretty neutral towards LeBron but seeing Cleveland suck in sports is a guilty pleasure of mine.
where the FUCK is mosgov? where the FUCK is delly? where the fuck is pipe man? there's no actual rotation\n\ni really, really hate to say it but we were better off with blatt. he wasn't the greatest coach but he at least tried to steer the team in the right direction. lue is just lebron's yes man.\n\nwe need a COACH, not a yes man
He was a decent coach and a good basketball mind.
Like stealing a taco from a LeBaby!!!

After watching that game, I\'ve come to the conclusion Lebron is the biggest chump in the NBA. Pushing down Draymond an putting your nuts in his face. If he had pushed you back you\'d be playing the victim like you always do.But don\'t worry I\'d be upset to if I was about to lose my FIFTH Finals series but you\'re considered "The King". That title belong to MJ! Are you gonna have another \xe2\x80\x9cDecision\xe2\x80\x9d Bron? Is it sad that YOU needed Wade to win your two rings? While Wade won one on his own? \xf0\x9f\x90\xb8\xe2\x98\x95\xef\xb8\x8f An I don\'t want Cavs fans to use the same excuse last year "Oh well we don\'t have Kyrie an Love but when they do we gonna beat them." There in the game but ain\'t doing shit. We\'re seeing a new dynasty coming together in front of our eyes. \n
Lol @ LBJ padding his stats at the end.  ESPN gonna eat that shit up and proclaim him the player of the game.
Nobody feels bad for LeBron. He chose this
Best game in the series so far excitement-wise, but I just want to point out, props to ABC/ESPN for not showing the douche that ran on the floor in the last minute. Fuck guys like them. 
Lebron quit on the team. Love is trash. Irving tried his best at the end but he just couldn't put it together. \n\nCavs will never win a championship.
2/7 confirmed!
He gets 34 from Kyrie, great team defense, his team protecting the ball (he had 7 of the Cavs 11 turnovers.) and a two point game going into the fourth. \n\nOnly to be outplayed by Andre Iguodala, imposing his frustrations on Stephen Curry & Draymond Green, and his only buckets being "stat padding time" buckets. \n\nBut yeah, tell me more about how this is okay because "Dis the greatest team in history, what dew u want?"
Are you out of you damn mind? \n\n1. This post has 0 to do with Stephen Curry. I'm a hypocrite when I didn't even mention the man?\n\n2. Yeah I remember Kobe in the 2010 Finals, I remember the 15 boards he crashed when his shot wasn't falling, I remember the 3/14 he held Ray Allen to, I remember how he still led the game in scoring. What I don't remember is him ever bitching at Rondo or Ray Allen when things looked bleak.\n\n3. Wade and Bosh could do nothing when LeBron struggled? Dwyane Wade averaged 27/7/5 my man, and Bosh averaged 19/7, both scoring more than James did. So I don't know what the hell you're talking about here.
I'm not sure if you're serious. But the entire Warriors team played like shit on Wednesday. \n\nThe Cavs today? Not so much. 
I've watched him get swept in 2007, score 8 on 3-11 shooting against the Mavs, get bailed out in 2013 by a miracle that he gets all the credit for, get annihilated in 2014, but this is to me his worst performance in the Finals. No heart, no hustle, and worst of all no brain. But most importantly, No. Excuses. It's enough. 
Lebron fans never fault him, they just move the blame around 
It's like we were waiting for a LeBron takeover that never happened.
But stat padding sure did happen 
Cavs MVP\n\nhttps://vine.co/v/iLuzZ1YlqOi
Lol that cavs offense is fucking atrocious. Thank god Lebron got his boy the head coaching gig!

holy shit...green is not LeBron's color...LMFAO
Lol, so much doubt in this thread.\n\nLook what happened, LeBron lead them from the depths of 3-1 series to a sweet victory for the city of Cleveland.\n\nI think this thread show how over reactive people can be some times.
For all the people who have NEVER REALLY PLAYED BALL.\n\nDraymond green is an amazing player. I know you are used to 2k and players being literally the product of complex algorithms but real players understand how to win and Dray just got into "THE KINGS" head and completely took him out of the game.\n\nI know I\'ll get down voted into oblivion but whatever at least I\'m not blind. 
He got into brons head and THEN, the game was over
he's a beast! only people who don't play ball hate him
Love flops like a bitch at the 3-point line, no comment from announcers.\n\nVarejao flops a little bit under the goal, announcers suddenly want fouls to be overturned by replay.
The Warriors gave Cleveland a win just so they could win it all at home.

[Lebron mad af rn](https://fat.gfycat.com/DimpledHatefulFishingcat.mp4)
Lebron looks like 2011 Lebron out there in losses. Turning the ball over left and right, unable to even hit his fucking free throws. \n\nhttp://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/2011-nba-finals-mavericks-vs-heat.html\n\nhttp://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/2016-nba-finals-cavaliers-vs-warriors.html \n\nFollow this bbref link when it updates. He already has as many turnovers as he did in 2011. He fluffed his stats this game. His jumper looks awful. It's just not great ball from him. He's passing up easy looks at the basket like he did in 2011 as well. He was in the right mindset during game 3, but idk I guess the defense got to him and he got a little jumpy.\n
When people cry that today's NBA is soft and they prefer the physical play of the 80s and 90s, direct them to this series.

bron probably wont get one for the land :/
Someone called Stephen curry a bitch in the Doris Burke interview. He looked nervous like he was ready to get outta town.
>AF\n\n>fasho\n\n>AF\n\n\n\nI don\'t see anything wrong with him shrugging these dudes off. Less about privelege and being in the hood and more about tactless fans being annoying. If I saw him I\'d probably be like "what\'s up dude, love watching you play" or some shit and move on. Not run up on the dude with my phone out yelling shit out like it\'s a worldstar video. Ghetto gas station or suburban neighborhood that kinda behavior is probably shrugged off the same way.\n\n
> He looked nervous like he was ready to get outta town.\n\nI've been to Cleveland, I don't blame him.
Sorry but if I'm a Cavs fan I'll be furious with Lebron and Kyrie's refusal to shoot the three at all in the final minute. I get that it's probably not going to make a difference but you try. Two treys and one good defensive possession and you're right there with a shot. The Warriors were completely keeping the lane open and LBJ/Kyrie went right into stat-padding mode.
will there be any excuses for why Warriors won title this year?
It will be LeBron didnt have enough help.
Overly healthy 
If Blake and CP3 hadn't gotten hurt they would have beaten the Blazers and then beaten the Warriors in round 2. Best I could come up with. \n\n
Love and Kyrie were too healthy
Cleveland and their "Believeland" shit lmao. Best believe you\'re losing in five.

Kevin Love never lost a playoff game while concussed and inactive 
Huge disappointment. Lue really let everyone down by letting the Cavs iso for so many possessions and leaving Love in. Terrible decisions. LeBron needs to sit earlier in the game or be a metric fuck-ton more decisive going to the rim. This half-ass driving looking for bail-outs hasn't worked for Westbrook his entire career, what makes you think it'll work for you, LeBron?
It\'s a world tailor made for you\n\nDoris couldn\'t have described Curry\'s public perception any better
The series is over. Ill eat nailsl If the cavs end up winning. WITH NO MILK.
**WHERE THE FUCK WAS MOZGOV?**
That 4th quarter was appalling. Warriors stepped up and we didn't. Simple as that. 
W-will Barkley be okay?
Theres so many things i dont understand about cavs game. Whole 4th quarter they're lazily jacking up 3s, against the best 3pt shooting team in history. And then only when they are down by 10 with 2 minutes left do they finally start driving to the basket... but are fouling Klay and Curry every possession to stop the clock, making it impossible to make up any ground. How could any of this possibly work? Im not coaching genius but I can fucking count, obviously the exact opposite should have been happening.\n\nI dont see why people are hating on Kyrie though. He and bron were the only ones who didnt appear to have completely given up 2 minutes into the 4th. 
Steph Curry is Regigigas confirmed, and 5 turns have apparently passed.
17/36 on 3-PT. dear lord
i laugh at ref call for a tech. of kerr at half time for the no call on the final shot. really a coach complaining and you call a tech. Ref. you miss a lot of calls and call that one. you guys suck.
1..Draymond \n2. Another game like Game 4 for Curry putting him just ahead 
Livingston seems to be playing pretty damn well. Or maybe Draymond?

glad u have finally seen the light
This will probably get buried but I'm gay
xD he's homosexual so funny
Yes refs were terrible. Yes we really sucked in the 4th quarter, but I really have to hand it to GSW. I honestly thought we had this game coming into the 4th, and as a die-hard Cavs fan, I rarely have that feeling. Props, they absolutely shut us out at the end there.
http://i.imgur.com/VaoyqQb.png?1
Lebron has no shame in stat padding  
Curry is back in the Finals MVP race!
I think it's still Draymond, he had the Cavs rattled in the 4th.
http://m.imgur.com/xXoacMy.jpg
I regret clicking on that. I feel very uncomfortable now. 
There's gonna be a lot of blame on Love, but it was Lebron and Kyrie killing the Cavs' offense with hero ball from the end of the 3rd through the 4th.\n\nI think I counted 10 of 12 possessions in a row that were iso, before I stopped counting.
Watching bronbron try to goon it up and then pad his stats at the end in a loss was delicious.   Mmmmm. 
One of the worst officiated finals games ever. You can say they let both sides get away with everything, or they're letting them play, but I don't care - it makes the game so frustrating to watch. Call a foul if it's a foul regardless. Can't stand this officiating
That was not even basketball out there...it was a horribly called game...so many blatant missed calls.

TIL Brendan Haywood is a pretty good tv personality
Lebron's green suit totally made up for that loss tonight. 
I know there's a lot here to discuss with the way the stars played but I want to point out how completely bad ass Anderson Varejao few minutes were. The way he rebounded was a huge difference maker at a real critical point in the game.
Kyrie just seems to be missing something that would put him among the elite players in the NBA. What is it? Basketball IQ? Durability?
I mean y'all asked for this. The Chef delivered. 
Seems like the whole city of Cleveland was "All In," except for the Cavs
This is a LeBron hater's wet dream.
Where's all those Cavs fans that came out of their caves after game 3. The shit talking was hilarious. 
2016 is the year that Varejao wins an NBA championship.\n
Proof that the only way to win a ring is to leave Cleveland. 
GOD HATES CLEVELAND
LeBron won't ever be the GOAT until he can come through in the clutch. You'd think Kyrie was the one and only superstar on this team towards the end, with the amount of iso possessions he was taking. LeBron just can't score when it matters.
And this is why Kobe is still better than LeBron
Lakers fans always trying to shoehorn Kobe into everything :P\n\nNot that I disagree.
Meh, had a bunch of idiots i had to argue with earlier about it. Plus, shitposting is fun...especially when its the truth\n\nCheers
Don't see how anyone can even consider him for that title. Top 5? Sure. GOAT? It will always be MJ. Can't beat 6-0 with 6 finals MVPs and his ability to take over in the playoffs.
People in the future will look at the stats and go, look how efficient he was! But he basically did nothing in the 4th and garbage timed himself 6 points in the last 40 seconds.
He can, however, boost his stats in garbage time with easy dunks\n\nThe Bronsexuals s are ready to point to these sheets to say "if only his teammates performed!!!!1!"
Bro he decided to be selfish as fuck at the end of the game\n\n\nHe put his stat line over his team\n\nIn the fucking NBA finals 
No u ain't.. 
They are down 9 fouling curry and Thompson\n\nAnd he was taking layups and dunks\n\nHow is that trying to win?\n\nHe could have shot 3s or passed to jr 
it was over because he took those shots 
Yes he did exactly that. He knew the game was over, but instead of shooting threes, which is what he knew he needed to do. He did a bunch of angry dunks. Interesting. What does MVP mean again?
Thompson went HAM, and IMO Irving was Better than him today\n\nBut I know Lebron is great, but he was clearly frustrated by GSW defense tonight. I hate when the LeApologists think they only ever lose cuz of everyone but Lebron 
LOL i know that feeling bro, im almost doing an "NBA Memes" impression.\n\nI figure were all gonna be reactionary assholes anyways, might as well go with it
Even JVG called that shit out lmao\n\n

Only LeBron can have a near triple double shooting over 50% and still be considered passive.  Him reacting to Draymond tells me he knows he's lost the series.

Well, LeBron IS a bitch.
The Cavs didn't even go down fighting at the end. Instead Lebron took **layups**. I don't know what to think anymore.\n\nI fully expect Golden State to close this series out on Monday -- by **at least** 20.
 http://i.imgur.com/8vdJr8Q.jpg 
but reddit told me they sucked and curry was a bum now\n
Cleveland has 0 depth. It is literally Lebron and Kyrie carrying the team.....and usually individually. God Damnit Love, you had one fucking job!\n\nCould you imagine if CP3 was on the Cav's. That work ethic alone would be huge. 
Maybe Space Jam 2's plot is that LeBron lost his jumpshot and he needs Bugs and his friends' help to get it back.\n\nMaybe they are already doing the film?
Does anyone have a gif of Igoudala stiff arming someone?
Does anyone else think maybe they realized they couldn't hit jumpers so they were going for layups with lots of contact for and-1s but just wouldn't get calls.
Its over. Lebron 2-5 in the finals lol
Cavs 0-3 in finals. 
I am getting hit, but the refs aren\'t seeing it that way - Lebron\n\nstay classy, there were no calls on both sides of the ball. Major ones. 
Kevin Love lost Cleveland this game when he got continually bitched by Anderson Fucking Varejao. I couldn't believe what I was watching. \n\nLeBron also shrinked and got frustrated towards the end. Can't see how the cavs can win game 5 let alone the series. 
My semi unbiased take on the game:\n\n1. The refs were absolute trash, inconsistent on both ends of the floor and really let the game get out of their control. I was seriously surprised there wasnt a double tech on Lebron and Green during their scuffle.\n\n2. Cavs absolutely lost this game in the 4th, Lue was absolute trash by letting them run iso plays and trying to play hero ball and playing Lebron and Kyrie nearly the entire second half. Also, what was he thinking by having Frye out there with Kyrie trying to guard Curry off the pick??? Golden State played a semi solid game (mainly because the refs just messed up the entire game so badly). Steph Curry is a great player and you certainly should NOT let him get free off of those picks. Klay Thompson also had a solid performance. \n\n3. Lebron just looked so much less aggressive than he should have. He didn't have a bad game by all means, he nearly had a triple double, however, he has TOO MANY TURNOVERS (to quote the 2k15 coach).\n\nOverall, I think this game was hard to watch for both fans due to how horrid the officiating was. I still hope my Cavs can win it, but both the players and Lue need to get their shit together. Congrats to GS on the win. Like I said, this was an extremely poorly officiated game on both ends so there is no reason we should be acting like the refs acted in favor of one team over the other.
KEVIN LOVE IS UNDEFEATED WHEN HE DOESN'T PLAY IN THE GAME.
What a boring finals at his point might as well let it be over. great season in the nba too bad it has to end on a low note
Once again all I notice is how LeBron will drive hard to the rim and kick the ball back out. He also has multiple times matched up with Curry and still wants to pass the ball. At some point someone has to tell LeBron to take over when he can easily get his way. Too much facilitation in the finals on his part. 
I think everyone is forgetting that Love has now lost a game in Cleveland 
Not when in the starting lineup! 
TACOS MOTHA FUCKAS!!!!!!
LeBitch showed his true colors tonight.
Lebron " Fuck you, I\'m the greatest. Fuck your weakass team"\nCurry "Check the score board"
Definitely. It's just kind of maddening if you're a Cavs fan (maddeningly hilarious if you're an outside observer) that they actually probably had a demonstrably ***better*** formula for matching up against them, and ended up completely shooting themselves in the foot by trading away a player they could desperately use right now in exchange for somebody that, honestly, I can't imagine they even want on the court. They literally paid out the nose so they could downgrade.\n\nBut hey, wouldn't be Cleveland otherwise!
LeBron was a giant bitch the entire game. Kyrie and LeBron disappeared in the 4th quarter. The Cavs shot 15 for 26 from the free throw line and Cavs fans want to blame the refs for the loss. Curry is backed. League is fucked. Warriors repeat in 5.
[Cleveland in the second half](http://imgur.com/0OY2Yu0) NSFW
LOL Lebron stat padded so hard at the end. Makes it look like he had a good game even though he played mediocre.
Every player is different, but I personally do believe in the notion that LBJ doesn't have the same killer mentality that lifted MJ and Kobe to greatness. LBJ seemed to pass off when he had great opportunities to drive to the rim a little too much in this game and G1, in my opinion. But LBJ is his own man... he dominates in his own way, whether it's with that killer mentality or not.
The Cleveland Cavaliers just beat the Cleveland Cavaliers tonight. Up by 8 in the third, losing that lead then resorting to ISO ball playing right into GS hands. Pathetic 
Lol fuck LeBron. He can't step over anyone when down 1-2 and down in the game. Green earned so much respect from me by walking away when it was so obvious LeBron was goading him.
Kevin Love is still undefeated at home in the post season as a starter
James Michael McAdoo has not lost an NBA Finals game
Really loser this series is my liver
Lebron's ultra stat padding is the main reason i don't take the idiots reciting his finals counting stats seriously\n\nwhat a joke of a performance 
Personally I think it's silly as hell to say this Warriors team can beat the showtime Lakers.\n\nBut 20 years from now in 2K36, you can be damn sure that this 73-9 team will be featured as one of the classics.
TristanThompson underrated by Lue; Keving Love overrated by Lue.\n\nDelly underrated by Lue; Irving overrated by Lue.
As good as the first half was the second half was a complete shit show.
Checked LeBron stats and didn't even notice he was doing so much. \n\n* 25pts (don't look at this though. Around 6 added from the stat padding time) \n\n* 13reb\n\n* 9ast\n\n* 2stl\n\n* 3blk\n\nStill wasn't enough though. I wish he aimed to score instead of obviously pass during the earlier quarters. \n\nIt does kinda seem that he's getting the Shaq treatment. Some of his drives looked like he was getting hacked but the lack of close ups make it unclear. \n\nAt least it was a close game compared to the first 3 games. Refs were terrible on both sides though. 
I guarantee you didn't watch the game right? He looked like shit out there. He had 18 points before padding his stats in the last minute. Stop with the bullshit foul excuses. 
B-But this team was the chosen one! They were healthy this time! THEY WERE SUPPOSE TO DESTROY THE ~~SITH~~ WARRIORS! NOT CEMENT THEIR LEGACY AS THE GREATEST TEAM OF ALL TIME.
LeBron: "Boy free up some cap space so I can join ya\'lls squad next season."\nCurry: "Hell naw mayne gtfo with that bs."
Iggy
the only series the cavs big 3 have lost is with 2 of the 3 out lol. nice narrative.
I don\'t know how anyone can watch that game and still say that the "series is rigged". The officiating was awful on both sides, and it still then favored the Cavs. LeBron gets away with fouls on multiple possesions and doesn\'t get punished or thrashed by the commentators/social media for pushing Draymond to the ground and then stepping over him. If Draymond does that, he\'s being ridicudled by ESPN, Reddit, Twtitter, etc. Just yet again shows that LeBron gets this insane cushion from the refs. 
Lebron should have been patient and stayed with Miami. He still would have made the finals, and would probably have beaten the warriors last year..Let's not pretend that Riley would have gotten them the players the need. Now he has handcuffed himself, and since he will never bring a trophy to Cleveland, his career will be seen as a loser that couldn't do it without another player that if not better, but at least his equal (D-Wade).\n\nHis finals performance have also been extremely poor. There is the series against Mavericks that will always be in the back of his mind and something that lebron haters love to bring up, and now this series, where it is painfully obvious his game has fallen off a cliff. Maybe it really is mental, or he just doesn't have the physical tool that made him a beast from 2010-2014. But clearly his time has passed. \n\nIMO, he needs to take a year off from the finals, maybe lose in the 2nd or 3rd round next season, and come back with a fresh mentality, and a fresher body. No way the cavs are winning with how great the Warriors are.  
empty stats. he made 0 difference in the game tonight. Cleveland needs him to be Jordan, and not chris paul. 
Lebron with the game low +/-, 7 TOV, usual 40% shooting (stat padded near the end) and an epic missed clutch free throws to lose the game. his empty counting stats and bad defense exposed. \n\n\n"Best player in the game" lmao\n\n"Top 5 all time" nahh\n\n2/7 confirmed\n\n/r/nba teenager army going to sleep crying tonight 
I seriously hate this sub. LeBron is a hero after game 3, everyone loves him, he\'s the GOAT..  but now that game 4 is over lebron is a bitch.\n\nWas he frustrated in game 4? Hell yeah he was and it was visible, but that doesn\'t change his fucking career\'s work. How can you praise a man 2 days ago, but now he\'s just a bitch?\n\nAnd is curry god again now? Or are we still gonna call him overrated like after games 1-3?\n\nLeBron is great, Curry is great. Individual games don\'t change this. They both are and will always be amazing, once in a lifetime players. Everyone bashes the media for their "hot takes" but this sub is the biggest offender.
They're not the same people 
Lmfao cavs fans so cocky before the game. Now they're team can go back to being losers. And to top it all off they live in fucking Ohio.\n\nChoke is real. 
Weren't the Cavs the favorites at the start of the regular season for whatever reason?
So losing to arguably the greatest team of all time is "choking"?

Unpopular opinion (maybe): My thoughts on this would've been the same no matter the result but I loved the officiating tonight. As a fan, I've been praying for a taste of old school basketball and tonight we got exactly that. Undoubtedly there were missed calls but the refs letting both teams get physical and not automatically blowing a whistle anytime a guy drove hard into the paint was a breath of fresh air. The chippiness of the whole game provided an unbelievably tensed atmosphere that hasn't happened too many times recently. I loved it and hope it continues past these Finals.
This wasn't old school basketball. This was occasionally letting the game get out of hand and occasionally calling weak fouls, with no consistency. 
Idk why but people have a super distorted view of old basketball
Totally agree, they would call stupid shit but then let guys whack each other in the face
