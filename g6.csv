In my mind, Barnes will absolutely,  no doubt, get a max contract. Teams will definitely want a player that can disrupt the Warriors' offense like only he can |Pistons|1078

No matter how much you lost betting on the Warriors the last two games, nobody lost as much money as Harrison Barnes\n|NBA|766

LA will still max him.|Timberwolves|1

and its the final two episodes of GoT... I have a feeling GoT will be a better watch if LeBron is still possessed.....\n\nDubs have lost their mojo/cool ala OKC... its exact same fucking thing. |Bulls|9
You're the king of goofs if you think even LeBron possessed would turn a Warriors home game into a lopsided Cavs win. ||-5
Yeah, because that didn't happen 3 days ago. Oh wait.||8
One of their best 3 players was suspended ... you goof||1
Green wasn't suspended today was he? Or when he railed the fuck out of dubs in game 3?\n\n|Bulls|5
Damn, you're right. I forgot that the most recent game will dictate how the next one is played. Sorry games 1 and 2 -- you were too far in the past to be relevant. Draymond, don't bother suiting up. HinduHamma is predicting that you'll be ineffectual based on two games and ignoring the regular season and a 2nd team all-nba. Goddamn, I know this sub seems to hate the Warriors but the recency bias is just stupid.||-1
It's playoff time. Regular season don't mean shit right now.\n\nCurry is not even MVP in playoffs.\n\nYa green had lebrons number first two games\n\nGuess what, it's called fucking adjustments.\n\nLebron and the cavs made adjustments. \n\nGreen hasn't evident by the fact lebron has had his dick all over greens weak ass for 4 straight games.\n\nGreens for 1 fucking game left to prove he can handle lebron better than the last 4 tries... my money is on lebron.\n\n\n\n|Bulls|2
Let me get this straight...\n\nCavs made adjustments, and you think 2014 Coach of the Year Steve Kerr won't?\n\nYou think that the regular season MVP won't bounce back. And if he doesn't, you think the rest of his team won't find ways to pick up the slack?\n\n\nTheir last two games at home with a full lineup were blowouts. If you seriously think that the Cavs, with a possessed LeBron, will blowout a team that has broken the record for wins in a regular season ON THEIR OWN HOME COURT, then I was right. You are the King of Goofs. Take a seat right over there next to Ramsey Bolton as you both get egg on your face come Sunday.||0

I feel like there's only 1 guaranteed and thats GOT. MITB is good on paper but they could easily fuck it up. game 7 is a toss up.|Warriors|6
Even if the results don't go the way I want, I think MITB will be fantastic match wise. It generally doesn't bother if the guy I want loses as long as it's entertaining. |Nuggets|1

They're not worse, it's just that Kyrie and Love aren't injured anymore (~~although Loves playing like he is~~)\n\nedit: Forgot Love had a concussion :(|Cavaliers|250
Delly and Mozgov definitely look worse. Mo Williams should continue as the backup PG he played well tonight|Rockets|1
That's not true. Mozgov has regressed quite a bit. He never fully rebounded his game after a knee injury. |Pacers|1
Love has to still have concussion side effects|Cavaliers|1
The exception being mosgov. He is definitely significantly worse all season. Also, Delly has played a great season but is a ghost this playoff run.|Cavaliers|3
Maybe Delly will come back out if we need him to dive for Curry's ankles|Cavaliers|2

I bet he's super fatigued right now. If this were the NFL he'd still be questionable for game 7|[SAS] Tim Duncan|25
Yeah I was getting fucking furious seeing some of the comments about him as a player post the concussion. Bright lights and loud noises are fucking awful when you're concussed. No one but K Love knows what it feels like to be out there right now but I bet it's not good.|Cavaliers|1
Yeah it's just unfortunate that it's happening on this stage. Hopefully he clears up for Sunday but I can't blame him for any of this. Concussions are no joke|[SAS] Tim Duncan|1
I hope the NBA gets super pro-active about concussions. I do not think Love should have played in games 5 or 6. Concussions are scary as fuck, and as far as I know the severity was not disclosed.|[MIL] Dell Curry|5
Man I got a concussion a couple years ago, had a nasty headache afterward but it was gone the next day. Rested for a day or two.\n\nTried to do some cardio a couple days later and I puked like two minutes into it.\n\nConcussions are fucking scary shit.|[SAC] Oscar Robertson|13

How is this valid? He's been a monster this series. |Cavaliers|1
He's proven himself as a rebounder and a defender in this series. The announcers called him elite at a couple of points.|Cavaliers|2
>He's proven himself as a rebounder and a defender\n\nSounds like a role player to me \n\n|[CHI] Luol Deng|5
Dennis Rodman was a role player too and you can bet an in prime Rodman would get $16M+ a year today.|[ORL] Mario Hezonja|1
I never said role players  shouldn't get paid, I was just replying to the cavs fan (or bandwagoner) who said teams would be dumb to give them the max when the team they're supporting famously did so this year|[CHI] Luol Deng|1
Thompson didn't get the max though. If you recall, he was holding out for $94M, he got $82M.|[ORL] Mario Hezonja|1
He has been paid exactly what he was needed for this series. If we don't have him I doubt we win. He;s the only big that can do PnR and still guard well. If he can't do that we're fucked.|Cavaliers|3
I dunno. He still has never been able to demonstrate consistent performance. That's always been his knock, that he's hot one day and literally worthless the next.\n\nThis series is just going to solidify that and leave that idea real fucking fresh in the minds of GMs. He'll probably get it, but I don't think it's a guarantee anymore. ||12
He'll probably get fewer offers, but at least one team will.|[NYK] J.R. Smith|3

Plz stop fouling love let him stay on the court he wins us the game :-(|Warriors|1
Hahaha.You're obviously not from Cleveland.|Cavaliers|1
It felt over at two fouls on Curry.|Thunder|1
I knew it was going to be a "Down by 20 at half, cut it to single digits at the end of the third, get LeBron\'ed in the 4th" game the second we lost Game 5. This HAD to go seven games. One single game to determine "Golden State caps the greatest season ever as LeBron comes up short again" or "LeBron delivers a title to Cleveland as the 73 win Warriors choke a 3-1 lead." No matter what happens, the outcome of this one game is going to be talked about for decades. |Warriors|2
When Kyrie answered the first Warriors points with that 3 I felt like it was over.|Mavericks|2
Thanks Harrison "Kevin love" barnes|[DET] Ben Wallace|3
As a Warriors fan with other buddies, all who are die hard Dubs fans, we all felt this way. The crowd at quickenloans was so punped after LeBron scored to go up 6-0.|NBA|7

What were they after lebron about?||1
Game was sealed by the end of Q1|Knicks|6
It felt like that for a while, at the end of the 3rd when the Cavs were throwing three's up, I expected a GS run. ||11
well when they cut it to a 7 point lead I was expecting something more but never felt like the Dubs could do it||5
we just came out lookling like we didnt want to win this one. fucking disgraceful effort|[GSW] Andrew Bogut|12
ohh i gauran-fuckin-tee your boys wanted to win||7
I'm a cavs fan, but I think Golden State looked even worse at the end of the game. The look on their faces wouldn't lead me to think they will go into game 7 with any confidence at all. ||10
feels bad man|[GSW] Andrew Bogut|3
I'm hoping for a more competitive game with lead changes at least a few times. ||1
warriors will be okay|Cavaliers Bandwagon|3
Game was over when Kevin Love got benched for foul trouble.|Thunder|1749
While it's cool to have on Love right now I really hate what the Cavs and LeBron have done to him. Love was a super star player in Minny, and I think he still can be. They don't use him the way he played in Minny. I love LeBron, still want to see him win this ring, but he turned Love into scapegoat and I hate him for that. |Lakers|-1
Hiw did lebron turn k-love into a scapegoat lmao? He's done nothing but try and empower him this year. It's everyone else who's criticizing him, sometimes unfairly.||2
Yeah. I wanted Love to get T-ed up so bad when he was arguing his bs foul. I hope he gets suspended for game 7.||0

That's what I told my dad in the first half. Shumpert was trying his best in the first half to keep Golden State in it.||35
Seriously. Shumpert plays like such a dumbass |[CLE] LeBron James|9
I think when the trade happened the Cavs wanted Shumpert and the Knicks forced them to take J.R. with him. Weird how things worked out. |Knicks|13
Even last year... Honored Shump with a respectable contract and locked him up but JR we risked him walking. JRs so invaluable this year its incredible. |Cavaliers|8
i felt bad for love he had a nice block to open the game and got to the line a couple times and a few nice box outs for rebounds then he has to send his ass to the bench for 12 minutes|Trail Blazers|175

I honestly think he deserves to be suspended, but I don't want the cavs to win that way. Rooting for the cavs I want to defeat GSW at full strength. ||6
Doubt they will, but there is precedent \n\nhttps://twitter.com/BrettNBA/status/743652862895529989||2
Kind of sucks for the next guy down the road that throws his mouthpiece and gets suspended. "Sorry im not Steph Curry, and sorry this isnt a Finals game!"|Bulls|4
He's definitely not even close to being suspended. However, that was atrocious. I'm not a Steph or Warriors hater at all (I hate their fans, I think the team is great) but intention or not, to loose his cool like that was inexcusable. There's a lot of uppity assholes that sit in those floor seats especially during the finals. If that hits one of them in the eye, the league might have been looking at a legal issue. For the record if that hit me I would've been totally cool with it. Would've kept the mouth guard too. Someone else might not be so cool about it.|[SAS] Tim Duncan|7
I'm a Cavs fan and I'd hate it if Curry was suspended. I want a real Game 7.|Cavaliers|7
Zero chance he gets suspended. 1. He didn't do anything to warrant it. 2. The next game is going to destroy any previous game in history||98
Also - the call that got him elected was the second of two clean steals that were called against curry.||0
Perfect ratings play by NBA the business||2
1. The league suspended Haslam for a playoff game for the doing the same damn thing. |Wizards|9
There is precedent for players getting suspended for throwing their mouthpiece |Bulls|12
> 1. He didn't do anything to warrant it\n\n[Halem got suspended for for throwing his mouth guard and he didn't even hit anybody.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WjCLYqTp6F4) I'm not saying they'll suspend Steph (they won't) but it's definitely something that's been suspension worthy in the past. ||34
[There is precedent for only fining him.](https://youtu.be/D9d0jev3fn0) The player in your example tried to hit the ref with his mouth guard. |[IND] Paul George|2
TIL that Austin Rivers has a highlight video\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBEsuENd6P8|Clippers|1
He whipped it at the ref though. The league never looks kindly on aggression towards refs. No league does, the NHL suspended a defenceman on the Calgary Flames 20 games this season for hitting a ref. For reference, Stephen Jackson only got 30 games for the Malice at the Palace and he punched the shit out of multiple fans.|Raptors|11
to be fair, it looked like Haslem was aiming it at the ref.||8
He won't get suspended but in any other circumstance, throwing something at a fan like that could warrant suspension.|Lakers|60
He didn't throw it at a fan. It was obviously an accident.|Mavericks|-18
Lol what the fuck||2
Yes the mouthpiece just launched itself at the fan.  Curry had nothing to do with it ||6
Accident or not, to lose his cool and throw his mouth piece at all is distasteful|[SAS] Tim Duncan|2
I wouldn\'t call it an "accident." It\'s not like the mouth guard slipped out of his hand. He threw it purposely. Not trying to hit a fan, but without care or regard to where it hit or landed.|Lakers|23
That\'s exactly what I\'m saying. He didn\'t throw it "at" a fan, he threw it and it hit a fan. There\'s a massive difference.|Mavericks|-12
No it's not.  \n||6
Idk that fan was taunting the shit out of Curry |[POR] Damian Lillard|9
He threw it in a direction it could only hit fans. If I throw a rock aimlessly towards the ocean when I'm on the edge of a beach then I can't act like I didn't expect it to hit the water.|Cavaliers|17
Uhh, there was an incident where Austin Rivers broke his chair in frustration and threw the seat cushion/pad, hitting a woman. He only got fined $25k with no suspension. The only precedent is the player that threw something at an official, which is completely different. |[IND] Paul George|1

Quality postgame interview by LeBron there. |Warriors|523
Not knocking on LeBron personally but it's easy to stay classy/humble when you're winning.||8
LBJ is a billion dollar brand. Its easy to stay classy with all that money :D|Cavaliers Bandwagon|11
Well, and he puts a lot of effort into maintaining his image and "brand".  Not saying it\'s a bad thing, or that it\'s entirely disingenuous, but it\'s tough to argue he doesn\'t now have one of the most carefully curated public images in sports.|Pistons|2
While I'm sure there is some effort at brand maintenance I think you're overstating it quite a bit. Jordan and Kobe are great counterexamples as they both have similar if not greater marketability and neither has done much of anything to curate a good guy image. All 3 are good enough at basketball that they can build a brand solely on that as long as they don't do anything too extreme(see Kobe's rape accusations). LeBron just seems as grounded as you could be when you're as famous as he has been.|Magic|1

Something along the lines of Curry was the first ever unanimous MVP, and you're dominating him in the finals. How do you feel about that?||11
The idea that Curry didn't deserve that unanimous MVP is too absurd for words. Honestly the biggest no brainer of a century at that point in time. Anyone who says otherwise did not watch any Warriors basketball in 2015-2016.|Warriors|0
I agree with you. He didn't just smash a record. He put one on the outside of the records for three points. It's gonna be a looooooong time before some one comes close. |Cavaliers|9
He led a team to 73. And it was far from just a good 3 point shot. Ball handling, steals, drives, you name it. He has been a complete jaw dropping phenom. But yes, his 3 point and win record alone makes it a no brainer. He didn't just smash the record, he made previous records (his own) look like it belonged in high school. The circus level he played at all season is not that of a normal elite basketball MVP.|Warriors|7
One thing is certain, though. Win or lose he will not be the finals MVP|Magic|8
What if he drops 40 and makes the game winner||2
Nah, MVPs don't get ejected |Magic|1

>Draymond  \n>just don't do anything dumb.  \n\nLol|Cavaliers|1
And klay was terrible 1Q|[DAL] Dirk Nowitzki|3
I\'d say Steph and Klay have the most to be embarrassed about. Players don\'t play well sometimes. Shit happens. Fouling out for the 1st time this season in a huge game 6 in the Finals with a tantrum added to it. Leaving before the end of "a man\'s game". Those are embarrassing moves. \n\nAnd Harrison Barnes too.|Cavaliers|3
God Harrison Barnes is trash.\n\nI'm not a blame the refs guy, but at least 2 if not 3 of Curry's fouls weren't fouls. Not in the regular season and absolutely not in this series where they've been mauling each other. You can only do what you can, sometimes the calls just don't go your way, it happens|[MIL] Giannis Antetokounmpo|2
Ehh, after those last five minutes I would say Steph and Klay have plenty to embarassed of. Steph threw his mouth piece into the stands and hit a front row fan, and Thompson after boldly stating that this was a "man\'s game" went to the locker room early.||27
If I'm Steph I absolutely would have been angry too, it's not like he lined the fan up and threw it at him, he was angry over a bullshit foul in a game that meant something too him and he made a spur of the moment mistake. Then went directly to the fan and apologised. \n\nCan't really comment too much on Klay, he probably should have stayed out there. In saying that I don't particularly care that he left early.|[MIL] Giannis Antetokounmpo|7

> bullshit foul\n\nWhich part was bullshit, the part where he hit LBJ on the arm, or the part where he kneed him causing him to trip?|Wizards|1
The part where hes the mvp so he should get star treatment im guessing||1
To be honest, I'm surprised the refs gave him the tech. Not because it wasn't a good call - I've seen players get techs for less than that - but just because they actually had the balls to call it and eject the MVP. I get the feeling he probably said something to regret too which probably contributed.||9
I think the ejection was made easier for the ref since Curry had already fouled out, so they weren't making him miss any more game time.|Cavaliers|2
Steph should be embarrassed about all the stupid fouls he committed. There were a couple that probably shouldn't have been fouls but they wouldn't have mattered if he didn't make those 2-3 mistakes. |Warriors|2
Yeah, I have no idea what he thought was going to happen on those plays.||1
I'd say Barbosa was pretty solid. He scored 14 points in 18 minutes with 4-6 fg shooting.|Lakers|29
Barbose had his 'Livingston' game. He actually kept the Warriors within striking distance at points in the second half. |Bucks|1
Don't have any stats on hand, on mobile, but I feel as if he's had a nice playoffs and everytime he's on the court gets bucket, plays D etc. His minutes have seemingly become at more irrelevant times which is weird, considering the games GSW were dominating were the ones the bench took over.|New Jersey Nets|5
If James can pull off a game 7 win, in Oakland, after being down 3-1, bringing his down trodden home town it\'s first title in most fans life time.... I mean holy shit. I can\'t wait to watch that "30 for 30" 20 years from now.|Cavaliers|368
when Cleveland wins the championship it HAS to be under amazing odds... This is it\n\nReminds me of the Red Sox coming back from 3-0 from the Yankees in the ALCS to go onto the World Series to win it.... |Cavaliers|2
I can\'t believe they pulled it off! WOHOO "KING IN THE NORTHeast... ohio"|Cavaliers|1
You won't have to wait that long. I'm thinking it will get added to this, which will be released in the fall, I'm told.

I did ||1
I said Kyrie can't sustain >70% shooting inside and outside. I didn't say shit about LeBron cause I'm not a moron.|NBA|2
Kyrie was considerably worse than 5 (still really good), so I'm fine with being in that camp.|Timberwolves|6
Yeah there was no way he'd continue shooting 70% on ridiculous turnaround j's|Supersonics|7
I love being humbled, more basketball for us.|Thunder|3
OK I did say kyrie wouldnt hold it out on scoring for long but saying LBJ wouldn't do it is straight up ludicrous.|Heat|5
I'll admit I soured a bit on kyrie||13
I'll admit it. I knew LeBron would LeBron but gotta give Kyrie props. This dude been balling and straight up abusing Curry|Spurs|8
Well, they didnt. Kyrie shot 7/18 and had 23 points. Kyrie was unrealistically hot last game. LeBron though..\n\nThe scary thing for GS, is that LeBron didn't hit a bunch of circus shots in either game. Sure, he might not shoot 50% on threes again in game 7, but that still leaves him with what, a 35 point triple double? Nothing LeBron is doing is unrepeatable. He's LeBron James-ing. 3 days off, and then GS gets 45 minutes of 100% effort LeBron again.||8
I remember one GSW flair sayin he wasn't even watching the finals cause they were too easy compared to OKC|Raptors|9
I need to go find all of the comments from Warrior fans saying that POR would beat us and that we don't belong in the finals lol|Cavaliers|19
God, those comments were ridiculous. One had CLE as the sixth best team in the league behind even the Blazers and Clippers and it got a ton of upvotes. Can't say I'm complaining now that the circle jerk has turned the other way, though!|Cavaliers|2
Can everyone who said this was a man's league please stand up?\n\nI'm looking at you Klay Thompson hahahahaha|Timberwolves|668
Can somebody who understands size and power does not equal talent show and up? \n\nI expected more out of a twolves fan|Warriors Bandwagon|-9
I don't know what your point is, Thompson still played pretty well|Cavaliers|-2
walking off the court before the game is over after calling it a man's league seems silly|San Diego Clippers|12

I mean if GS wins game 7 the narrative will just change again.|Mavericks|1
Maybe for some, but LeBron would still deserve to win MVP in a landslide. ||1
Dunno. Klay has been balling out. |Lakers|3
*bawling\n\n\nftfy||4
Klay has easily been the Warriors best player this playoffs. Without his game 6 performance vs the Thunder they aren't in the Finals.|Lakers|21
He's getting outplayed by LeBron who he unwisely called out. Not the smartest move questioning the mental toughness of the best player in the world|[MIA] Dwyane Wade|40

Thanks for telling me to tag you|Bullets|1
Lmao|[CHI] Jimmy Butler|3
I've seen Warriors fans say this for 6 straight games|Bullets|5
All Steph is, and all he ever will be, is the best shooter in the world. He's got a pretty shit inside game, he has no defense worth mentioning (have you seen Kyrie make him just look fucking silly?) and his rebounding leaves much to be desired. Hell, Klay is a better all-around basketball player than Steph is; at least he plays high level defense as well as being a world-class shooter. LeBron is a pure all-around superstar.|Cavaliers|25
Steph has a shit inside game?\n\nConfirmed for having never watched this dude. That's hilarious. His touch around the rim is amazing.|[GSW] Corey Maggette|-23
This is the most volatile sub I\'ve ever seen. You\'re totally right. This coming from someone who can\'t stand that little bitch. Steph\'s inside game isn\'t elite, but it\'s absolutely not "shit". He just hasn\'t had it in this series. There\'s a reason the dude was named the first unanimous MVP in NBA history. True, it was mostly his outside shooting, but not that alone. His only problem is that he doesn\'t show up in the finals. ||0
during the regular season but bro watching during the finals and most of the playoffs has been a different story|Bullets|2
I think you got your feelings hurt. ||8
Bruh he isn't even the best player on his team in both finals...|Cavaliers|19
He has a 64% FG% around the rim...\n\nHow is that shit?|[GSW] Corey Maggette|-1
GSW might win, but Steph aint better than LBJ. He got the MVP cause GSW had the best season in the history of the NBA, not because hes better than everyone else individually.\n\nLBJ, KD, maybe even RWD are all > Steph imo.||14

Important to note that although the Warriors are still favored on Sunday, they\'ve never been under this amount of pressure to win. If the Cavs lose it\'s going to be "oh well, what do you expect the W\'s won 73 games and LeBron really played his heart out". The Warriors have a lot more riding on game 7 and I really can\'t wait to see how they respond|[SAS] Tim Duncan|106
Lebron has more riding on it. Noone will criticize curry for choking it up all series until last game ||0
No way, think about how the Patriots are viewed after they lost the Super Bowl in their undefeated year. The legacy of most wins in NBA history is tarnished if they dont win the championship. |Warriors|1
> The Warriors have a lot more riding on game 7\n\nWhat? It's the deciding game for the NBA championship. Both teams have everything riding on it.|Wizards|7
Nobody expected this series to go to 7... keep in mind that the Warriors are a 73-9 team with two of the best 3-point shooters in NBA history, one of which happens to be a back-to-back league MVP. They've broken record after record this season and were the heavy title favorites. The Cavs were down 1-3 and most NBA viewers expected them to lose in 5 or 6. It would be a great story if they won the series and the championship, but it wouldn't be exactly unexpected if they lost considering who they're up against.|Spurs|18
I'm a Patriots fan for football. Last night I couldn't help but feel like if the Warriors lose game 7 they're going to be compared to the 07 Patriots by some.||9
idk I think game 7 of the WCS had enough pressure. They were even down 13pts at one point||13
This is way more pressure than that. They've come all this way. And to be fair, the Thunder gave that game away. The Cavs showed tonight they aren't going to give games away like that|[SAS] Tim Duncan|28

Klay looks mentally defeated honestly. Talking shit and then pulling that. That's not the attitude of a winner|Cavaliers|55
He's the only reason they beat OKC though. Maybe he's exhausted because he's been carrying this team and the MVP on his shoulders the entire playoffs. ||14

LaGarrette Blount|Heat|7
LeGarrette Blount is a weird example all around. Does pretty decently for the Pats, signs a deal with the Steelers for 2 years, then almost immediately gets suspended for getting high with their #1 RB LeVeon Bell. Comes back and doesn't do much, walks off early in a game against the Titans, gets released, then goes back to the Pats and just goes off.\n\nPlus he got suspended in college for punching a Boise State player after they beat his Oregon team.|[OKC] Russell Westbrook|9
Punched a guy in Titans training camp his rookie year as well, if I remember it correctly.|New Jersey Nets|5
Yeah I remember watching that punch live lol. Blount clocked his ass|Thunder|6
Belichick cut a RB who score like 30 Fantasy points (so a lot of yards and TDs, forget exact numbers) for being late to a team meeting.\n\nNBA is too soft on calling out unprofessionalism. Remember Pistons walk-off against the Bulls? Klay should be called the fuck out just like Isiah was.|[MIL] Dell Curry|13
Jonas Gray was that running back, I believe. Torched my beloved Colts for four touchdowns. ||1
star players have too much impact/skill in nba to just discipline them in that same fashion. nfl is a league where the athletes are more easily replaceable and everyone is competing for PT|Lakers|2
I am not saying Klay gets cut, but the media should call him the fuck out on it. You don't say that LeBron's feelings are hurt then walk off like he did. That's being a bitch 101 and he should get ripped.|[MIL] Dell Curry|6
i\'m sure they will draw attention to it. but there\'s a ton of people on this sub that have an obsession with "man if lebron did that he\'d be so scrutinized.."\n\nfact of the matter is, we saw what he did tonight and understand why he\'s held at a completely different tier than your typical nba allstar.\n\ncurry will get there in the next few years (especially if he bulks up a bit), lebron\'s just really been one of the the most relevant names in the NBA for the past decade|Lakers|1
I have plenty of doubt that Curry will reach that top 10 all-time level. At this point, he's a tier above Nash and T-Mac, but still several rungs below Kobe and Byrd.|Pistons|7
He's already peaked|Hornets|2
As his team personnel changes and the league adapts to his play style, we will quickly figure out if he is a great player or one of the greatest players. Money's on the former.|Pistons|3
Why is no one making a big deal about Klay leaving early? I seem to remember a guard from a reigning champ leaving a game early, and it being a HUGE deal.||374
Why is it a big deal though?|Trail Blazers|-13
Do you think it's a big deal? I find these reaction to no reactions comments funny. If people cared they would react....||1
Who do you mean by people? If you mean fans, look around you, plenty of people are reacting. if you mean players? Not everyone is like Klay, calling people babies over small shit.|NBA|1
it's easy to criticize players bowing out, but he just saw his MVP teammate foul out for a pretty soft foul. if you put yourself in his or the fanbase's shoes, you're delusional if you don't think he'd be done for the night|Lakers|-2
Yeah, I lost a lot of respect for him there.  He can clearly talk shit about it being a man's game, but he won't even hang around after getting beat.|Trail Blazers|1
Is there a vod of it?||1

I mean I'm sure the uproar would be crazy, but what Klay did takes no imagination. He had a pity party and left, but no one cared||3

I think maybe he got his feelings hurt.|[CLE] Kevin Love|10
i wonder if his feelings got hurt|Bucks|6
He's not sure, he has to ask his dad first.|76ers|4
Biggest sore loser in the league. Remember the hate LeBron got at the end of his first CLE stint, just for not shaking hands? Klay can't even stick with his team til the game ends, smh||54
Fuck that guy, Klay could get a pass for that kind of shit, but he did it all throughout the season. He gave the Bucks crap for beating the Warriors, he gave the Blazers craps for beating the Warriors, I'm sure there's one or two other examples out there. Complete sore loser, give your opponent credit, they beat you in a game of basketball in 48 minutes. Now all of a sudden his team is getting the opposite end of the media, and he's going to act like a child about it, especially making the bitter comments that he's made previously in the series.|Cavaliers|35
All he said about the Bucks was they can celebrate now and we'll see them next week. \n\nHe left early because the game was over at that point . Relax.|Warriors|-31
If there's time on the clock the game isn't over. Any good coach will teach you that in any peewee level sport. |Cavaliers Bandwagon|6
Who fucking cares||-9
they said he threw a tantrum in the locker because someone didnt believe he didnt belong on alldefense or something. cant handle being number 2 I gues. ||5
Ah more reasons to hate the Warriors.|Lakers|13
Really though, I have no horse in this race and generally rooted for the Warriors all season because they were fun to watch. This post season though has made me despise them. Between their family members coming out and talking shit, draymond s antics against the thunder, and now curry and klay acting like spoiled little kids I'm having a real hard time rooting for them. Maybe it's just the additional media coverage on them, maybe it's just they expected the title to be gifted to them after being the Golden child all season, or maybe they just forgot what it's like to lose, but all of them need to grow up and act like adults. |Supersonics|8

CLG is a league of legends team in the NALCS. In the past, they have look promising at the beginning at the split (season) and collapsed near the end. Combined with other throws, the false hope meme was born.|Cavaliers|12
TBF they are also a counter strike team. They could have been #1 NA but just lost their star player,  and add a unit just haven't been performing well here a little later.|Hawks|1

CLG (Counter Logic Gaming) is a professional League of Legends Team.  The picture was from a wheel jokingly created by their former coach MonteCristo.  [Here's the video about the wheel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdkffhjcKj0).  Context starts at about a minute in.||21

In a turn of events, Curry gets suspended Game 7 and all hope is lost for the Warriors\xe2\x80\xa6until Barnes has the redemption game of his life leading Golden State to the win. He gets the Finals MVP Award and that max contract. |[POR] Allen Crabbe|782
Is this the Earth U-328?||1
That would certainly be the darkest timeline.|Thunder|2
That's exactly what will be going through his head when he misses 10 in a row in game 7.  |Rockets|2
That's a great image|Hawks|2
Bruh only way he gets Finals MVP and the max is if the Dubs shut out the Cavs and he's the only one to score points ||3
If he drops 40 and plays cautious enough to keep Love on the game, he'll have a chance|[IND] Paul George|2
Barnes and Love trade blows all game, both go for 50.|[DAL] Detlef Schrempf|4
Love goes for 39, 18 and 5 while Barnes goes for 41, 13 and 12 through only 3 quarters and in the 4th quarter, the Warriors outscore the Cavs 2-1, getting the game winning basket on a put back following Love's go-ahead free throw and Barnes' 13th straight heat check miss. |[IND] Paul George|3
Proceeds to average 10/2/2 for the rest of his career |Trail Blazers|6
They'd have to remake Believeland to put that in there.||9

He was at the game? Must've been wearing one of those Harry Potter cloaks, dude was invisible.|Raptors Bandwagon|2
idk man, rather have him over kd, don't wanna mess up the chemistry|[NYK] Chris Copeland|2
Like my God, he's been so God damn bad this finals I would never even think about giving him a max contract now. Not showing up to the biggest series is one thing, it's just sad at this point watching him play. ||2
Its wasnt just harrison barnes, curry got no help till klay thompson woke up. They were throwing 3 defenders at the mvp and the dubs couldnt make them pay. This is on kerr too|Warriors|2
Everyone is to blame, so many weak ass passes leading to turnovers during the whole series. It has been so frustrating to watch it happen, and then see Lebron throw a bullet. Like stop being lazy.|Warriors|1
What has me worried is theyve played poorly for 3 straight games, even game 4 which we won. Kerr has to figure this shit out. Otherwise this will be the biggest choke job in finals history. |Warriors|1
Even though Dubs will still be favored for Game 7 because it is at Oracle, I would not be surprised if this turns into a choke. No Bogut and possible no Iggy, Steph who seems rattled, no show Barnes, Klay "only awake for half a game" Thompson. The Warriors just flat look bad while the Cavs are on fire.|Warriors|1
Steph played well but the refs got in his head.|Warriors|1
That's another thing I don't get, maybe it's because I'm new to Basketball, but it seems like officiating is super inconsistent. One game in the series can be super physical and have nothing called, then another game will call every little tap. Seems like players have to figure out what is allowed and what isn't during the game. Seems ridiculous but I'm new so maybe that is normal.|Warriors|2
0-4 the first 7 minutes of the game. Then the gates of Hell opened. |Suns|2
Lowlights pls /u/bootum|Thunder|5
i gotchu bruh|[NYK] Chris Copeland|12
please bootum|[GSW] Stephen Curry|2
Forever. Least clutch warrior ever. |Warriors|10
He has hit a few very clutch shots in the past. He's just going through a drought at the worst moment...|Jazz|7
We call that "choking" |Warriors|2
Freaking Iggy with a broken back played twice the minutes than Barnes (30 to 16). |Raptors|4
Dude is building houses with those bricks||5
Stat from NBA.com:\n>Harrison Barnes is the only NBA player to never make a shot in his entire life||9
Damn cherry picked stats!|Lakers|3
I can't believe the title is coming down to Harrison Barnes missing shots with literally nobody guarding him|Warriors|23
So yes, you need Kevin Durant|Lakers|9
my condolences for the team who maxes him|Raptors|69
If DeRozan leaves, Toronto might very well max him out.|[BOS] Kevin Garnett|1
Not happening. If Raptors would max Barnes they sure as hell are maxing DeMar and he gets all that extra guaranteed money for staying |[TOR] Amir Johnson|3
It's not really an issue of cash at this point. If it's for money Toronto could pay him more than anyone, but if he's as interested in playing in LA as it's being made out to be he can sign a one year deal and get the max next season and make up any lost money. \n\nI'm just saying in the event he does leave (however unlikely) Toronto will pursue Barnes.|[BOS] Kevin Garnett|1
Lakers it is!|Hornets|7
I doubt we max Barnes, especially if we pick up Ingram. Barnes has been terrible this finals for sure.|[LAL] D'Angelo Russell|2
2 for 22 the last two games, just terrible. ||56
Every time he is wide open and misses a shot, I die a little inside.||1
Dude seriously is playing more shit then Kevin  Love||296
Then what?||0
And the worst part is he's trying harder.|Suns|1
At least for Love you can say he probably came back too early with the concussion.|Cavaliers|1
Race to the bottom and hb is winning|Warriors|1
Thats really just because he is playing|Cavaliers|1
That's gotta be an achievement on its own though |Raptors|1
At least he's playing|Lakers|6
12 minutes...|Knicks|3
16. With 0-13 shooting ||7
But Barnes hurts his team when hes on the floor. At least Love fouls himself out of playing |[TOR] Amir Johnson|7
7 points 3 rebounds and 2 assists in 11 minutes doesn't sound bad at all.|Cavaliers Bandwagon|4
Love at least hit 1 shot and drew some fouls.  I'm going to miss picking on him for being the worst player.  Seriously though, 0-8 on mostly wide open shots.  |Rockets|9
Shumpert has definitely been worse these finals but Love has definitely been the worst in terms of expectations these finals|Raptors|7
BREAKING: Game 7 to be decided by a game of HORSE between Barnes and Love.|Cavaliers|50

Fuck that, I've been on board with /u/Rabsho. Harrison Barnes is a pile of hot dogshit.  When he has a good game it is the exception not the rule. Dude might have the worst handle of any SF, SG, or PG in the league.|[GSW] Tom Gugliotta|13

AMA Request: The mouthpiece|[SAC] Oscar Robertson|2
I heard just today that some other Curry game mouthpiece sold for 5k. I'd be willing to bet this mouthpiece is more famous than that one was...||2
It's Dan Gilbert's son|Cavaliers|5
Forbes, not Gilbert||6
According to haralabob's Twitter account that was Dan Gilbert's son that got hit\nhttps://twitter.com/haralabob/status/743647937113186304|Trail Blazers|3
Even better.|Raptors|2
Might not be true, but I hope so just for humor|Trail Blazers|4
Not Gilbert's, Nate Forbes who has a minority share of the Cavs ownership.|[SAC] Oscar Robertson|4
Not nearly the comedy value. Too bad|Trail Blazers|2
They said on SC it was Nate Forbes' son.|Pistons|4
Too bad I guess? I dunno|Trail Blazers|3
Not for him.  He could probably get that signed through his connections and auction it off for 10k.  Not that he would need it.|Pistons|2
@GaryVee on Twitter and snapchat, he talks to the fan. Andrew Forbes||3
Or the camera man that got knocked down. |[SAS] Boban Marjanovic|3
you know he put it in his mouth on the way home... suckled on it like a newborn on some tittie|Mavericks|4
A real Cavs fan would've flopped to try and get Curry suspended for Game 7.|Cavaliers Bandwagon|6
Just today I saw someone selling a mouthpiece Curry threw to the floor during a game for $5000. \n\nThis one must be worth even more because it's the Finals and Curry fouled out etc. So yeah, I bet he's making fucking bank if he picked it up and kept it.|Warriors|8
[Sell it for 5k](http://www.sbnation.com/lookit/2016/6/15/11948830/you-can-now-own-stephen-currys-mouthguard).\n\nThen again, this is a special Finals mouthguard that commemorates Steph's first ejection. So 20k.|Celtics|16

How much did you sell it for?\n\n"Reserve not met"\n\n||9
 "Sir, we asked how it was to get hit by Steph\'s mouthpiece, not how Ayesha feels every time she sees LeBron block another of Steph\'s shots."|Cavaliers|30
Looks like it's a perfect set-up for Love to drop 65 in Game 7 and get finals MVP|Cavaliers|126
People keep saying this, but the dude is concussed. He shouldn't even be playing really. Whatever contribution he can make is good enough for me. |Cavaliers|1
Vintage Kevin Love|Raptors|2
I said this today to a co-worker. If there's a game 7, Love will have a good game. Usually happens when people stop expecting the world from you. ||16
I haven't expected anything from him for a while now||5
so barnes is gonna drop 40?|Lakers|2
Could happen||1
he is going to need too. Cavs will need something else to get this last win.|Cavaliers Bandwagon|6
No bogut and a hobbled Iguadola? You think Barnes turns it around? Because Steph needs therapy after this game, counseling, something. Dude has been broken.|Mavericks|5
I think Steph will play well next game. Plus he probably won't foul out on his own floor.|Cavaliers Bandwagon|7
I think Steph plays well, Klay though seemed really dejected after this game. Has played well the whole series and is seeing the team lose regardless. Draymond is getting pissy too, but I still bet he shows up determined as fuck game 7. Igoudala looked banged up tonight, he's a question mark now. Barnes is playing like shit. Ezeli was underwhelming.  \n\nShould be interesting.|New Jersey Nets|3

LeBron has been the player that everyone says dethroned Kobe. He's the one that people bring up about being better than Kobe. He's also the antithesis of Kobe by constantly switching teams to chase championships and unwillingness to take that last shot early in his career. Most Lakers fans I know don't like LeBron. Warriors are just that little brother who've always been jealous of our success but we didn't really pay attention to because they were irrelevant for so long. They always talked shit about us but it wasn't even a deal because they were never a threat. LeBron was a credible threat for a long time.|Lakers|2

I have a friend who's a die hard lebron fan and the way I get him to shutup is by saying this, Lebron is elite at almost everything except shooting, creating his own shot and one on one defense, all those hes a step or two below elite. While Kobe was elite at those three things but a step below elite in what lebron excels at, Creating for others, passing, rebounding, secondary defense. |[LAL] Ronny Turiaf|2

Kobe = r'hllor confirmed |Lakers|2

I\'ve said it before but he\'s Jaime Lannister. Accused of unforgivable sexual acts, thought of as a betrayer ("running Shaq out of town", "kingslayer"), lost what made him great (sword hand, achilles foot work), huge respect for the greats before him, reps gold, charismatic, charming smile, even people who want to hate him end up liking him, etc.|Lakers|5
[deleted]||1
What's the point? Defending a suit is gonna cost money too + extra media exposure + the however small chance that the jury goes against you. A settlement is sometimes the right financial or business decision -- it is not an admission of guilt.\n\nRemember the chick that ruined Brian Banks career? Accused him of raping her, he got 6 years in prison. She made the rape up completely. Total bullshit. She also sued the school where it allegedly happened and they settled for $750,000. Wasn't necessarily the wrong move for them to settle either! Most cases settle!\n\nYou have a warped opinion regarding the reality of the legal system.|Lakers|1

I want to compare both to the Hype Sparrow and King Tommen Slayer of Hype but it would be kinda dick to both.\n\nKobe is Barristan the Bold. LeBron is Ser Arthur Dayne.|Heat|9

True. I just meant Mike's Bulls might not be able to beat LeBron when he plays the way he does in elimination games.|[BOS] Kevin Garnett|2
Rodman keeps Love/Thompson off the boards. Pippen can focus on guarding LeBron all game long and you stick Jordan on Kyrie.\n\nAnd no one on that team can guard Jordan.|[LAL] Kobe Bryant|1
idk about that.. if MJ smells blood it's over, lebron is a killer when it matters most but MJ was on another level from anybody, thats why he's the GOAT. i wouldn't take it that far|Thunder|3

Not salt.  I'd be happy to link the conference standings over the last 10 years if you'd like.|Lakers|-8
saltity salty salt salt keep jerking it to old kobe games hoping your team comes back into relevancy \n\nedit: you're pissed, whiny or being a bitch|Magic|-2
Do you think that salt is original or funny at this point?  Like, just say I'm pissed, whiny, or being a bitch if you think I'm out to lunch.  But the overuse of salt and circlejerk makes me feel like I'm arguing at a junior high cafeteria table.|Lakers|3
lmao just take your downvotes like a man and give up on the lebron hate|Magic|1
Dude, you can't beat a retard in an argument. He'll just bring you down to his level and beat you through experience.\n\nI'm a SoCal native so I root against all NorCal sports teams, and I'm fucking loving this Lebron ride right now, but anyone who seriously thinks the East or Lebron has been the better conference since the end of the Bulls reign is drinking the denial kool aid. \n\nSince '99:\nSpurs, Lakers, Lakers, Lakers, Spurs, PISTONS, Spurs, HEAT, Spurs, CELTICS, Lakers, Lakers, Mavericks, HEAT, HEAT, Spurs, Warriors.\n\nThat's 12 to 5. And do we want to make a list of the All Time greats that played in the last 17 years? Very heavily on the West.\n\nLet the kids be kids buddy.||2
To be fair, you did claim your argument had "objectivity" before any attempt to actually support the supposed "objectivity" of your argument. Even your threat of linking standings doesn\'t support your argument, because it doesn\'t saying anything about how LeBron would perform. So your misuse of the word "objectivity" is very much reminiscent of junior high cafeteria debates where kids are using big words they don\'t understand in hopes of elevating their argument.\n\nSo. Much. Salt.|Suns|3
His teams would've been defeated many times in the West. |Spurs|-1
I think okc could've beat the cavs this year||1
I mean we all had to deal with him in the finals cuz he made it every year|Warriors|6
oh wow it's been over 6 years..\n|Cavaliers|2
I'd say 2012 Bulls theoretically (RIP Knees), but yes technically they haven't had any serious threats since 10' Celtics.||4

I feel vidicated by this win. Yes, a fucking alien rapes and pillages our conference year after year. To put into terms you Western Conference teams can understand, it's like if Shaq maximized his potential and stayed in one conference for his entire career. |Pistons|68
Except that version of Shaq also has Westbrook's quicks and hustle, plus Magic's court vision and passing skill. |NBA|1
Oh no, Shaq with maxed out EV's would be much worse. He'd score 50 a game without fail. |Vancouver Grizzlies|1

Counts as 10 rings. He'd be 12-4 at that point. Unbelievable.|[CLE] LeBron James|5

30+ on less than 40% is nothing special.||-25
Lol k|[LAL] Smush Parker|15
It ain't. He played great last year but that was largely due to dad dicking everyone on the boards and constantly finding the open man. He is a great post player and you needed those shots and misses from him. But don't act like it was something else. THIS is something else. THIS is great and efficient. But him shooting less than 40% on 36ppg is the reason Iggy won FMVP. ||-13
It hurts when you pee cuz you jerk off to Curry too much. |Cavaliers|11
I forgot how awful people on this sub are. So you objectively think that 30ish points is good if it's below 40%? ||-8
It is when it's the NBA finals. There is no point looking at the fg% without any context on why he shot poorly or why he had to score so much. Youre just an idiot. |Cavaliers|1
Lol. Dropping from 58 to less than 40 is sooo gooooood||1
[deleted]||7
36 and 40 isn't that great, especially considering his game 6 melt down where he was throwing a hissyfit and walked off the court with 7 minutes to go. \n\nWhy don't you take your biases elsewhere. I already said he had a great series nyukka. But not enough to win. ||-2

Dude forreal. On the Game #5 post it was downvoted but soooo many people were saying that. It's like, did they not see the 2015 NBA Finals? LeBron is fucking brilliant. Any moron who doesn't see it by this point REGARDLESS of what happens in Game #7 will never accept it. |Heat|221
I just love all the lebron's not really a scorer shit that goes around||1
Most of them didn't see the 2015 NBA finals, probably. |[OKC] Steven Adams|1
Lebron is an all time great man, but game 7 is going to define a major piece of his legacy. This is actually the most important game in his career lol. |Minneapolis Lakers|6
So true Iguodala got Lebrons finals MVP last year because he limited James and thus stopped what had been the most amazing single player performance in the finals.  Win or Lose Lebron is the MVP of this finals.  Be better if he wins though so Cleveland can get a championship and be the only team to win after being down 3-1 while James takes the MVP.  It would close the gap to a manageable distance for Lebron to overtake MJ.||21
[deleted]||8
Sunday will be the biggest game of Lebrons Career.  Jordan is still my all time greatest, but Lebron stands alone in the conversation with him.  ||13
Have they not watched his career? He was also putting up monster numbers against Kawhi, and he's dubbed a Lebron stopper.|Nuggets|11
You need 5 men to actually defend LeBron, because 1 on 1 he will get his and if you start to double then you have now allowed one the greatest passers in the league open targets. You must play impeccable team defense. \n\n He is so amazing. I take a lot of players in this league for granted, as we all do. But everytime I watch LBJ, I'm in awe. What are the chances the most physically gifted athlete I've seen on a basketball court is also incredibly unselfish and has as high a Bball IQ as anyone who's played the game.\n\nHe's something to cherish, honestly. And this isn't some overreaction to his performance the past two games, I've been as big a Lebron as anyone since he's been in the league.|New Jersey Nets|4

From the 5 minute mark of the 3rd quarter to the 2:26 minute mark of the 4th quarter [14 minutes 34 seconds], Lebron James scored or assisted on every single Cavs point [With the Exception of the Kyrie Irving Techincal Free Throw].

I'm not fan of Lebron or Curry, but he is much better than Curry. Curry is a great shooter, but he's a one dimensional player. He's nothing on D, whereas Lebron is a great all-around player.|Rockets|2
Harden is a one dimensional player. Curry is undersized but not a bad defender imo - I know people hate on bball breakdown but they did one about Curry's defense and after watching that I've noticed what they're talking about when I watch gsw. He's not like Ike harden or Wade where they just don't try at all. Kyrie is worse as well when it comes to that.||1
Holy shit what a stat.|[CLE] Kyrie Irving|2
Yeah.. this man is in his 30s and it's unbelievable how he manages to maintain this level of play. I'm also pretty sure he leads both team by minutes played. It's unreal man.|Knicks|3
He's 31 now.  He's been in the league for 13 seasons.  Been to the NBA finals for 7 seasons.  He had a high number of minutes per game throughout his career and playoff runs since 2006.  He has a lot of mileage on his wheels.|Cavaliers|1
Not just now, but serious consideration for all time. I have not seen a better or greater player in my lifetime - and I'm not a 12 year old like a third of this sub|Heat|9

True, people fail to realize that almost every single award given in this sport isn't given to the player/coach that truly deserves it. Which is why I'm getting downvoted immensely for thinking that LBJ doesn't deserve a Finals MVP even if he loses. Because it's not gonna happen.|Warriors|0
Then who else would win finals mvp for the cavs? |[LAL] Kobe Bryant|1

All the sports shows spent this season talking about curry being best I n the world. Lebron talked about the mvp award going to curry with a chip on his shoulder. These finals show lebron is just going ham.||57

I don't think he lead in blocks and steals last year||3
Your are correct.  He was the first player to lead in P/R/A last year.\n\nNow he might be first to lead in P/R/A/B/S.|Trail Blazers|14
Yeah, he prabsly is||2
Have you seen the stats he is averaging between this and last years finals? Dude is an absolute monster|Spurs|205
The greatest ever. \n\nReally.|Suns|30
I've been saying he's the GOAT since last finals as well. Dragging those cabs to 6 with gsw was amazing. Let's hope for a good game 7||2
His finals appearance is making a case for greatest ever yes, but Lebron still has more to do to pass MJ for GOAT.\n\nLebron is certainly playing like a GOAT rn but recency bias is huge in this thread rn.|Raptors|31
With 4 finals losses, he isn't going to make GOAT conversation unless he gets a couple more rings.|New Jersey Nets|-12
No, you're wrong. No one has ever had a 10 year stretch like this. Ever. |Suns|14
Bill Russell? Jordan?\n\nMeh, Finals losses have to count for something, or in his case, count against him. Lets ignore the fact that he wilted against dallas and needed a Jesus Shuttleworth bailout to stop him from being 1-5 in the finals. Recency bias is strong in this sub. Just 4 games ago everyone was shitting on Lebron saying he can't shoot. Now he's the GOAT? Ok whatever. |New Jersey Nets|3
There's no need to ignore either of those things - but you're ignoring his game 6 and 7 performances in 2013.\n\nHe's not 1-5, end of story. \n\nHe's also had the best 2 year finals performance, ever. \n\nChampionships are a team metric. \n\nThere's literally nothing more he could have done, outside of 2011, ever. \n\nBy a slew of metrics, he's the best elimination game performer in NBA history. After 13 years and in his 6th consecutive Finals appeareance, he puts up the #1 and #3 game scores in Finals history, while facing elimination against the best record team in NBA history.\n\nIf you want to shortsell him, that's your prerogative, but you're wrong, and also missing out on appreciating something that's never been done before, not my Michael or Magic or anyone else. \n\n|Suns|17
Loosing in the finals is better than loosing in earlier playoff rounds.|Rockets|14
Who was better?||1
Michael Jordan?? |Raptors|1
I've been around a long time. \n\nI saw the 96 Bulls in person. \n\nLeBron is the best I've ever seen. |Suns|44
MJ never had a 2011 meltdown like LBJ. Watched them also, MJ is the best in the Playoffs and Finals. That fire never dies. ||0
Agree, MJ may be the best pure shooter I've ever seen, but the best all around player is Lebron. To me, that makes him the greatest player ever. ||5
It's just the all around impact he has.|Hawks|30
It is. There's been nothing like it, ever. |Suns|21
I think the point is that even if Lebron is better than Jordan was, he hasn\'t proven that confidently enough to overshadow Jordan\'s greater career accomplishments (and I don\'t just mean rings). \n\nBut he\'s definitely on pace, if he maintains anywhere near this level of play through the coming years. Plus, if they do take game 7, beating the "best team ever" is a HUGE feather in his cap as far as legacy is concerned.|[BKN] Markel Brown|14
One of the best individual Finals performances ever imo |Mavericks|178
It rivals last year from him. Which is fucking insane.|Lakers|1
Can we rename the FMVP trophy after him already?|NBA|3
Along with last year's. The man is an absolute machine.||3
I mean last year he almost averaged a 30 pt triple double his team was just maimed |Bulls|159
He's almost doing that this year and he's doing it way more efficiently. More points last year though |Heat|1
This year with a healthy cavs....|[CLE] Kyrie Irving|2
Both he and his team dominated tonight and got in the Warriors' heads. |Mavericks|5
efficiency is much better this year|Cavaliers|32
Efficiency is so hot right now.|Bucks|5
I can't even blame him for the bad efficiency last year. When you're scoring option 1,2, and 3 for a team you're going to have to take some shitty shots. |Cavaliers|10
There's no question, putting up those numbers is incredible regardless of efficiency. \n\nBut putting up those same numbers efficiently, while still leaving plenty of offensive touches for teammates that are actually performing this time around (and then making a greater defensive impact with the added stamina of taking plays off on offense) is even MORE impressive.|[BKN] Markel Brown|7
Defense too|Hornets|13

I just want to see Cleveland win one so Lebron can get that damn monkey off his back. That and if Warriors win this series, we will be hearing from GSW fans that this is the GOAT team. \n\nWhich is bull shit because OKC would\'ve won the WCF if NBA showed an ounce of favoritism to them that they have shown Cleveland. Dray should\'ve been suspended for the kick or at the least, the trip. The Lebron James "cock punch" suspension was crap though.|New Jersey Nets|4

I'll give you the 5th, but he got Lebron on the arm how is that not a foul? Or you just think it shouldn't be called because he has 5 already?|Cavaliers|7
He never said they weren't bullshit calls. Because they were. That's the game, Cavs have had shit calls, so have the Dubs. Fact is if the Warriors hadn't laid a goose egg in the first then we very well might be crowning them right now. Calls go both ways, no point in complaining about it. |[CLE] Matthew Dellavedova|17

Someone please upload the Lebron highlights! As a Bulls fan I despised Lebron for years but wow... he made the Finals his showcase, MJ style. It was a privilege to watch that game. Just completely took over in the 4th - it was like he looked at his teammates and said "Alright fellas, I got this. Let me take over and follow me to the promise land". He was involved on every play on both ends of the floor, creating chances for himself & his teammates while also playing stellar D. What a display of physicality, accuracy and perennial basketball IQ. I can\'t begin to think how people hate this man - we are witnessing greatness, people! Enjoy it while we lasts. I felt like a kid in a candy store watching this game, it might be one of my favourite games ever & I said that after watching him erupt with Kyrie in Game 5! Definitely my favourite Lebron performance ever. I can\'t wait for Game 7, I think its going to be a special one. |Bulls|40
Look up FreeDawkins on YouTube. All the highlights you want. |Thunder|1
Thanks!|Bulls|1
Reporters: What did LeBron say?\n\nCurry: Nothing\n\nLeBron: I said he\'s "nothing".|Heat|77

Just curious but is tomorrow Skips last day? I thought the announcement said some like he'll be on until the end of the NBA season. And since Sunday is the last day of the season will he be done or is he there on Monday to recap the last game?||5
Monday will be his last day.||2
I hope they get into it. \n\nthis series took a huge swing when Dray swung, but the bigger story should be LeBron saving his best for the highest stage. I wish I could be mad, but the Warriors fell into a canyon and spent most of the game trying to get back in. \n\nHere's to Game 7. Both teams have had their moments and now we get to see who has what it takes. |Magic|32
As a relatively neutral fan I just want the game to be close.|Cavaliers Bandwagon|7
Both teams are 2-1 at home this series and both Steph and Lebron have had great games on the road. I have no idea what to expect, but I hope there's a legit crunch time. These double digit victories have been pretty brutal. |Magic|8
Lebron's gonna go for 55.||1
He can't drive then. |Magic|1
Don't understand Warriors fans saying this was rigged. We got a couple tough ones, but were mostly just outplayed by LeBron. The worst calls for us were the ones against Kevin Love. We need that guy in the game, can't have him getting in early foul trouble.|[GSW] Ronny Turiaf|154
Must have been rigged for iggy to have back problems, we all know curry has been planning a mouth guard throw since March, and I know for a fact that Harrison Barnes can start sucking on command. \n\n/s|[DAL] Dirk Nowitzki|1
Ehh, maybe on that last one|[GSW] Ronny Turiaf|2
I'm not an NBA fan, just college, but I watched tonight. What I don't understand is the NBA screen. The Cavs screen players with their hands up high and will actually impede player's progress, but it doesn't get called. Warriors usually set screens like they do in collegewith the hands down low. Is that something that just doesn't get called in the NBA?||1
Not really. Seems to me that refs are mostly looking at the player's feet.|[GSW] Ronny Turiaf|1
Hard to play tough D when you're in foul trouble and the refs are basically calling whatever they want.||2
Because Steph's defense is just so great|Clippers|9
I honestly do think his legs are still bothering him. He's never been a great defender but he's struggling to move laterally more than usual and it's really allowed the Cavs to attack him on that end. Probably why he attempted so many risky plays- what else can you do when you're a step behind?|Cavaliers|1
Thank you for not saying "rigged". It was pretty bad both ways. Cavs had a lot of bad fouls called on us earlier, and the Warriors had a lot of bad calls late. It was just evenly shitty. |East|3
No chance was it rigged, but I think it was heavily one sided. Majority of truly terrible and inconsistent refereeing was going against GSW. Not that Cavs didn't get a fair share too, just the lions share was against GSW. I mean Curry fouling out peaks a lot. And his last foul was the weakest 6th I've ever seen.\n\nBut credit to the Cavs, they still won it. They wanted it and kept a really cool head. And when you put the Warriors down by 20 in the 1st, they don't recover. ||-10
The 6th on curry was a foul they called  on Irving attempting to do the exact same thing to curry earlier in the game.  |Cavaliers|1
Funny.. I was saying the worst calls in the game were against Kevin Love... Huh thats interesting.. I guess we'll see his Game 7 performance|[CLE] Kyrie Irving|9
When was the last time a star player got his 6th foul during an NBA game, let alone in the finals?||16
Wasn't that Kevin Durant in that crazy win that the dubs had over the thunder during regular season?|Warriors Bandwagon|19
Oooooh, that game had me fuming.  Not even especially on the referees, though.  Just a frustrating sequence of events in general.|Raptors|3
I always think people that complain about calls are new to the game. The home team always looks like they're getting more calls but usually they're always the aggressor.\n\nThere was a stretch there where the Warriors looked like trash and we're lucky that curry and klay were just being themselves||7
Especially the calls on Curry. Yes they were bad, but you can't put yourself in that position. He played dumb and got hammered for it.||10
It was funny seeing him react so strongly and then on slowmo you could easily see it was a foul (apart from that steal on kyrie which maybe had a foul before the  steal)|Finland|12
Exactly I thought the Warriors were getting the benefit of the calls most of the night, with the exception of a few calls |Clippers|3
That first Q submarined Golden State. Everyone was scared and Cleveland rightfully put the pressure on Steph to play defense since he was going to be working them on the other end. \n\nThey got rattled and the rest of the game was just playing catch up. Barnes might not be the same after this series, win or lose. 2-20 in the last two games. |Magic|14
Steph deserved the MVP for the regular season, but LeBron deserves the Finals MVP, no matter who wins game 7.|Lakers|1128
Klay probably been the most consistently good player for them |Cavaliers|1
LeBron is so competitive. If he loses Game 7, good luck getting him to accept the Finals MVP. He wouldn't want to be up there accepting an award he likely would say himself he didn't deserve because Cavs didn't win. |Lakers|1
I think I'll agree with this.||1
I think Curry is a contender still he's the leading assist man for the Cavaliers while playing for the Warriors..||2
we've been through this before, finals mvp goes to the winning team\n\nlebron had better stats with a harder carry last year and still didn't win fmvp\n\nits either (insert random warriors player) or lebron|Trail Blazers|2
Remember last year when Lebron almost got it in a losing performance? No fucking way he doesn't get t in a 3-3 finals|Cavaliers|2
We said that last season too but didn't happen.|Raptors|2
Lebron is the Most Valuable Player by FAR in the finals. ||2
He deserved it last year too|Cavaliers|2
I don't want to be a prisoner of the moment but I think after this Finals, even if the Cavs lose, that I'm going to have to reconsider my feelings on Steph being better than Lebron.|Lakers|2
Shoulda won it last year too |Mavericks|3
This is a discussion I had with a coworker after game 4. His argument was basically that the MVP has to come from the winning team, otherwise by definition the best player on the losing team did not contribute enough value. IDK, obviously LBJ has had the best finals performance thru game 6, and how could you give it to anyone else!?!?!?||3
Your coworker is right. It's not about not contributing enough value, it's just very straightforward: if your team loses, you are not the most valuable player. If you don't play, your team STILL loses, so basically you had no value at all unless you win. IMPACT is a different thing. ||-2
This is a 5 game series without all of the shit he pulled off. I think Lebron has earned Finals MVP, unless Klay goes the fuck off and wins it for the Dubs.||12
Should've won it last finals also.|Cavaliers|9
Dude, Lebron deserved Finals MVPs for putting the team on his back last year when Kevin and Kyrie were out. It'd mean a lot more if the award didn't automatically go to a member of the winning team.||7
1. LeBron 2. Kyrie 3. Klay |Kings|8
I don't know. I mean I agree with you, he's obviously the best player here, but Klay's holding the Warrios afloat right now|Celtics|110
Only possible gsw choice is Klay.||1
Did I miss the part where Curry had a bad game today? |Pistons|1
The only time Klay was the best player for the Warriors they lost the game...|NBA|1
Klay was super inefficient and has been|Heat|4
What about anything he has done is inefficient? In the last 2 losses he has shot 9/21 from 3 and 30/41 from the field. Yes he has been shooting below his season marks in this finals series but that usually happens as the intensity ramps up. However, I just have stats to back it up, you probably just have reddits feelings which clearly gets hurt after every loss no matter who wins. Everyone comes back saltier than ever it's hilarious.||2
You have to watch the game to see how inefficient he is. Sure his stats are worse, but he's taking worse shots, playing much worse defense and turning the ball over more. He's been playing decent at relative to his regular season self but that isn't worthy of a FMVP. The intensity has ramped up like you said, and Lebron has put up historic numbers. Your intensity argument helps Lebron.|Heat|1
I'm not talking about the MVP, if LeBron were to lose and still get finals MVP I'd have no problem with it. I wouldn't care if they gave it to Kyrie. Honestly' if Cleveland wins give it to Barnes, finals MVP doesn't mean anything to me. I'm talking about the fact that you're calling him inefficient. You're saying poor shot selection, defense and TOs are the signs. Can I ask if you thought Kyrie was inefficient because of those same traits in game 5? They weren't the best shots down the stretch but the man was so on fire it didn't matter. He turned the ball over 4 times, which is as many times as Klay. Of course Kyrie handles the ball a lot more, but 4 TOs is a lot. And of course he doesn't always play the best defense but he has tried all series. So was his game inefficient?\n\nAlso, as someone who watched the Warriors all season, is Klay forcing more, yes. Do I think he's inefficient, no. When you shoot like Klay force it, I wished he forced more in the 4th quarter instead of giving Barnes wide open threes. Defensively, I am not seeing what you are seeing. He is guarding Kyrie, of course Kyrie is going to get his. Maybe if he was tasked with guarding JR and JR was dropping 20 or 30, then you could really say his defense was much worse.||1
All my efficiency arguments have been made of the comparison to his regular season totals. Almost every single metric is lower. I understand your intensity argument but there's also an argument to be made (in your favor) that Klay has been forced to play like a #1 option with Curry's lack of elite play/foul trouble. Relative to the rest of his team, Klay has been pretty good, however, my original argument of Klay's inconsistency was related to Lebron which I know at this point isn't fair.\n\nI understand your argument about defense and I'm actually inclined to agree. I was just a little disappointed in Klay's guarding of Kyrie since Klay is heralded as an elite defender. |Heat|2
Wow, thank you for having a relatively civil conversation on r/NBA, can we just have more of these please? Not going to lie, I came into this fired up but thank you random stranger for taking the time to write a cohesive statement. I feel more level headed now. On to game 7, I'm as nervous as ever and I still have until Sunday.||1
I was just about to compliment you on your civility as well. It's usually very hard to have any sort of discussion on here. Good luck in Game 7!|Heat|2
he was garbage the first 3 ganes|[CLE] LeBron James|12
Like who on the Warriors could you even give it to? Livingston?  I'd rather drink bleach than live in a world where Shaun fucking Livingston got a Finals MVP over the performance Lebron has put on.|Raptors|728
This might be the greatest comment of all time ||1
I would guess whoever the difference maker is in game 7 if they win?? Idk|Bulls|1
It would probably go to Klay at this point. |Hawks|1
Klay so far. It depends on what happens game 7 though. If one player had a breakout game, it could change.|Cavaliers|2
No one on the WArriors deserve it over LBJ|Raptors|2
Klay has been solid, he's getting no help though|Thunder|2
Klay Thompson for sure.|Cavaliers|2
Klay... the only one playing properly|Hawks|3
If the warriors do win I think Klay should get it. He's played really well throughout the whole playoffs, and played well throughout all the finals games too|Lakers|3
Easily Klay. He's been stepping up when Steph hasn't shown up. |[LAL] D'Angelo Russell|3
Didn't Jerry west win it once, even though the team lost? \n\nSo the precedent has already been set. Lebron should get it hands down. |New Jersey Nets|3
That's what we said last year, and LeBron had a better statline last year, albeit a higher usage rate.|[IND] George Hill|3
I think Klay would get it if they give it to a Warrior. |Raptors|3
Steph has played well these last 2 games, and Klay has probably been the mvl of the playoffs for the warriors so far; however, they aren't even close to Lebron's level right now. I know they probably won't give it to him but he definitely deserves it, just like last year.|Lakers|7
It would be Klay if it was someone on the Warriors, right?|Jazz|4
Curry is averaging like 24 ppg on 43% shooting.\n\nCompared to LeBron's stats it should still go to LeBron, but they could justify giving it to Curry (which I would disagree with).|Heat|6
Klay Thompson has been a 3rd Quarter god this entire playoffs. Even when the Warriors lose, he's the only reason they ever have a sniff at a comeback. Thompson has been GOAT while Curry has been lackluster.|Bulls|18
Klay is the clear answer here. He' the only dude bringing it somewhat consistently, but can't carry the whole team on his back.|Warriors|12
Klay?|[NYK] Pablo Prigioni|7
It'll probably go to Curry I guess?\n\nI can't believe I'm saying this two years in a row, but Lebron deserves the FMVP no matter who wins.  Two fucking years in a row.  What the fuck.|Knicks|294
Lebron didn't deserve finals mvp last year, this year definitely thouih|Warriors|-51
35.8/13.3/8.8. I'm sorry that's just like a 2k line. I'm not pissed Iggy got it, he was great, and definitely my second choice. But he won it because he way outperformed expectations. Nobody saw him coming. Without that, LeBron would have had it.|76ers|17
**2014-15 Finals**\n\nIguodala: 16.3pts 5.8reb 4.0ast 0.3blk 1.3stl\n\nLeBron: 35.8pts 13.3reb 8.8ast 0.5blk 1.3stl\n\nCome on man. \n|Suns|54
I completely agree with you; however, I can kinda accept Iggy with the FMVP.  This year is completely different, there is only one FMVP, and that is Lebron James.||9
Yeah I can accept it too, just like I could "accept" someone from the Warriors winning it this year if they win (they are the winners after all)...doesn\'t make it *right* though...and I have no clue why anyone would choose anyone besides LeBron this year or the last, but it is what it is. |Suns|4
That would be amongst the weakest finals MVPs ever. He's played well below his regular season ability, and has disappeared at large stretches this finals.|Pistons|0
Klay. He's been their best player this playoffs. Lebron no doubt deserves it tho.|[WAS] John Wall|57
Curry is going to get it (tho LBJ deserves it) 38 in game 4 and 30 last night all on good efficiency. Klay was pretty awful last night and worse than Curry in g 4|Nets|1
first year of unanimous mvp, first year for finals mvp regardless of won or lost|[CLE] LeBron James|2
Jerry West already won a finals MVP without his team winning in 1969.|Lakers|14

Well that just seems straight idiotic.|Pelicans|4
Yeah what if some random dude went 60/20/15 in game 7 lmao|[DET] Darko Milicic|1
Yeah, Klay was my second choice.  I'm really not sure because Curry has scored decently well in the last two games.|Knicks|13
Curry is 23/4.8/4.0 on 60.3 ts%\n\nKlay is 20.5/3.2/1.8 on 58.4 ts%\n\nIntangible wise Curry opens the offense up more and facilitates while Klay has to defend Kyrie 24/7. Series wise Curry was huge in wins which probably would bump him up to FMVP at the moment, if Klay puts the team on his back game 7, he's probably the Dubs FMVP though|[GSW] Calbert Cheaney|1
Last 3, he had 38 in game 4. Game 5 he was alright but worse than average.||11
After tonight's game? Livingston should get the co-MVP with Barnes for helping the Cavs win the series.||392
But Livingston pretty much single handedly won game 1 lol|Cavaliers|7
Ouch|[CLE] LeBron James|12
Don't worry, we can include Kevin love in that co MVPs|Lakers|14
No matter who you wanted to win we all won tonight because Craig Sager gets to work another Finals Game.|Lakers|272
Does he really? Wasn't sure if that was just a one game thing but I would hope they'd let him do game 7 since that's the best thing in sports is a game 7. Not to mention the whole game 7 with Lebron vs a 73-win team|Rockets|1

2007 Detroit Game 5. Almost a decade later, didn't know if Lebron would bring out another performance like that in a do or die game. We are all witnesses.|Wizards|388
The Boston Game was insane too.|Warriors|1
From 2007 until now, that was the greatest performance I've ever seen on a basketball court.  But it's been eclipsed by him twice in the last 3 days.|Cavaliers|1
so true. first thing i thought when they showed the stat that he scored their last 18 points and then scored/assisted on last 27 points or whatever it was. witness.||1
Gotta do it in Game 7 as well.|Kings|1
Is that the game where Lebron scored the last 27 points including OT? I honestly don't watch much basket ball besides the finals ever since Pistons went to shitville||1
25 straight, 29 of last 30*|Heat|1
Yeah just absolutely ridiculous thinking one player can do that |Wizards|1
Don\'t forget Steve Kerr was calling that game live, said it was "Jordan-esque". Bet he\'s having some hot little flashbacks to it.|Lakers|2
That game 6 against the Celtics is up there with the Detroit one but this one was better. Detroit the best though.||2
The dude just did it twice in a row. \n\nThis time is a lot easier with a guy like Kyrie flanking him, but still. Amazing performance again. I think he's practically drooling right now for Father's Day of all days. |Magic|3
Game 6 against Boston?|Pelicans|3
G6 Boston was just as good, but this one where he scored almost all of the Cavs points during that one run is reminiscent of Detroit |Wizards|3
To be fair if cavs lost that game 5 against the pistons they wouldn't have been eliminated because there was still a game 6 to be played. These warriors game 5 and 6 was actually a do or die game for him. |Pelicans|134

I'm so sorry Tristan Thompson.|Bulls|0
TT has shown himself to be an elite rebounder and defender. I'll pay the max for a guy like that if he demands it.|Cavaliers|2
You said "Sacramento Kings" incorrectly.|Mavericks|1
I think he was worth the max up until this series. ||1
I'm sure his agent probably muttered that phrase while holding back laughter.|Clippers|1

Plot twist: Cavs offering max for Barnes for him to throw|Warriors Bandwagon|1
Well I can think of 2 people who say that.|Warriors|1
God, he was awful tonight. Dude can't create a shot to save his life |Spurs|2
Dude just set a few million on fire with his garbage play this series. \n\nLast two games, 2/22. Holy moly. ||4
Dude like half of the warriors fans said he was worth it after game 4|Heat|7
Basically, the fans that jumped on the bandwagon a year and a half ago. He has a few hype moments and that's like 1% of all his shots.|Warriors Bandwagon|1
Said everyone a couple months ago. *Now* no one ever|Celtics|19
I was not sipping the /r/nba  kool-aid. I knew from the jump Barnes was not worth a max, and now hes proving everyone like me correct.|Thunder|-1
I think most people on /r/nba find it laughable to think of Barnes as being worth anywhere close to max if you just watched him during the regular season.|Warriors Bandwagon|1
There was a thread about this and a ton of people wanted to keep him|Warriors|1
I don't get how anybody could have bought into his skill. He was sucking all season long, and he is just terribly inconsistent at getting 3s, yet keeps shooting that like that one kid in high school who HAS to go for the long shot and always misses.\n\nHe can't even hit jumpers like Livingston can, and he scored less points with more minutes compared to Ezeli.  Watching those shots in the first quarter were so cringe; I have no idea what Kerr was thinking passing the ball to Barnes for the shot just for him to miss every fucking time.\n\nI just want the Lakers to take him. You know, because he's obviously too good for the Dubs\n\n|Warriors Bandwagon|14

Loving the Lebron love for Sager |Wizards|109
Kerr saying that curry\'s fouls were "inappropriate for the league MVP" is annoying me more than it should. He doesn\'t deserve free passes because he\'s the mvp|76ers|233
LeBron has gotten crazy calls his entire fucking career, Curry gets none of that treatment AT ALL. That is what he is saying without actually saying it. Plus he also played with Jordan who got crazy calls as well.|[GSW] Tom Gugliotta|-54
Point Guard's dont get that treatment. Its just the way it is, IDK why. I watched prime rose dominate the league with no calls. Refs dont call it the same for PGs.|Bulls|1
Lmfao Lebron gets hammered every drive. If anything he should get more calls|Heat|3
If you watch Lebron regularly its very obvious that for every offensive foul they don't call on him there's at least one high contact play at the rim that doesn't get called either. He had one of the lowest percentages of fouls per drive to the basket of anyone in these playoffs as well.|Cavaliers|4
But he\'s saying "Curry is the MVP so he shouldn\'t be called for fouls", which is asinine and just makes me lose respect for him honestly. ||21
Not when their clean steals.||1
Okay sure, but it looked like a foul then and with slowmo it was a foul. Curry baited them into calling it and they did. It's what he gets for playing stupid.||1
I believe what Kerr was saying (implying) is that MVPs and veterans (dwade and others) usually get the favour of the ref. It is not fair in the slightest I believe but a part of the game. Lebron "flopping" and Kobe getting jump shot fouls are just to name a few. Its a theory that high caliber players should be playing better and not doing the wrong thing most of the time. But honestly that officiating was horrific for both sides but especially towards Steph|Celtics|3
[deleted]||1
During he post game presser. He was pretty noticeably pissed about them and said a few times that the refs were wrong/shouldn't call those types of fouls on the league mvp. \n\nI think some of them were weak calls, but it just really annoys me that he keeps bringing up the MVP thing. |76ers|18
Star players get calls though.  He got the opposite of that in this game.  Kerr said that they were shit fouls for any player, much less an MVP.  And he is totally right.\n\nI don't necessarily think that stars should get preferential treatment, but it is part of the game.  You don't want to help decide a game based on questionable fouls like these.  Unless you make more money from a game 7.  The Cavs would have won anyway, but refs need to do a better job.|Nuggets|1
I mean he took the most free throws in the game and definitely drove less than LeBron and played less minutes.  He made some dumb decisions. |Cavaliers|1
That being said, Curry played absoltutely stupidly. Going for balls he had no business going for, gamblig on plays, pressuring in absolutely weird situations. Mark Jackson likes to say you have to trust a guy to play with foul trouble, Curry did not play like somebody you can trust.||7
I think he meant they're unbecoming? idk|[TOR] DeMar DeRozan|1
The first time he said it I thought he was blaming curry, but then he said it like 5 or 6 more times and it just sounded so damn entitled and whiny. |76ers|1
I too thought it was strange he kept mentioning he was the MVP as if that means he's above being called for touch fouls. I mean I get his point but specifically saying MVP just rubbed me the wrong way. |Rockets|2
An unanimous MVP getting picked on defensively is pretty inappropriate too.||2
That sounds to me like he's not? Perhaps I'm missing more relevant context but it seems like he's saying that shit was weak for someone who is supposed to be an MVP.|Supersonics|2
I hate even more that the league is going to fine Kerr and anyone else's for criticizing the refs and alleging unfair treatment but will then let bad ref call key games and treat players unfairly. You can't knowingly do some shit and then fine people for accusing you of doing it.\n\nHonestly I feel like people's faith in the integrity of league is really low this postseason because of stuff like this.||12
Warriors wouldn't be in the Finals if it weren't for the refs|Hornets|6
me too. watching him bring that up over and over was irritating. \n\n|San Diego Clippers|5
Exactly. You're the MVP, you should be held to a higher standard. ||10
Is that what he meant? Or did he just mean the MVP shouldn't be playing in a way that gets him those fouls|Timberwolves|19
Considering Kerr wouldn't even criticize Dray for kicking people in the dick on purpose, I doubt he was calling out Curry for some light common fouls.|NBA|2
Kerr's inability to develop Curry's D is inappropriate for the league MVP. |Charlotte Hornets|65
Its more annoying that this is already a thing.we all know superstar calls exist.Kerr is right on something that shouldnt exist.You see it in soccer too.You tackle messi or ronaldo and you're an axe that doesnt deserve to play the game.Seriously when was the last time you've seen a superstar foul out.A point guard at that..goin on on a lil rant as knick fan melo is the only superstar player that never had any favors.After that suckerpunch in denver his image for the refs was ruined||22
I mean DRose didn't get super star calls either, neither does Boogie, there are a fair few stars that don't get the calls the way LeBron, Curry, Wade, and others do. |Bulls|1

The league made the Cavs shoot 52% and Warriors 40%.|76ers|57
Let's not pretend some of those calls were soft as FUCK. Just like the call on K.Love for his 3rd. Still, terrible fucking Refs on the biggest stage is absolutely unacceptable. Soccer/Football refs miss calls because they have no video replay, what in God's name is the NBAs excuse? ||15
The video replay is irrelevant, they don't use it during the game, as they shouldn't. it'd slow down the game to a ridiculous pace- see the last 2 minutes of any close game|Knicks|2
But the thing is we're 6 games in to the referees sucking in the Finals.  This is really the first game to be fair rather than favor the\nWarriors heavily outright.|Hornets|6
GTFO. What are you watching?! The Cavs Initiate more contact than the Warriors and get the benefit of the whistle.  The Warriors weren't allowed to protect the rim last game, while Lebron didn't have a single foul called on him contesting a ton of shots in the paint.|[GSW] Tom Gugliotta|-7

If there was was going to be a losing MVP it was last year. Although his efficiency wasn't as good, what he did those first 3 games was a far greater achievement considering the second best player on the team was essentialy a scrappy white dude from your local YMCA gym|Suns|1
Just like last year. Wait.||1

We all were saying this last year.\n\nbut this year he has been as prolific AND efficient.\n\nIt is insane.|Cavaliers Bandwagon|10
I never thought he would improve on last year's performance. His efficiency this year is a testament to how much weight was put on his shoulders last year carrying the team himself. He's not so gassed and so his shots are falling better.|Cavaliers|5
Should have had it last year to.|76ers|31
That's what is disappointing to me about that series. Despite what Lebron did on that floor, they end up giving MVP to a person on the winning team. We all know who deserved it most, but the record book will shamefully not acknowledge that ||5

It's hard not to say the Warriors are choking. They look like they are choking. They look beaten. They'll string together a spurt but it's almost entirely led by Curry or Thompson being as good as they are. But everything else about their performance just looks shook. Yes. Losing Bogut was a huge blow. Yes, Iguodala is clearly hurt and the Cavs are exploiting that. For all we know Curry *is* still less than 100% or whatever. But Barnes? Livingston? Green? Even Curry looks to be working harder to get his normal or less results while both he and Klay keep falling into somewhat predictable patterns. But the bottomline, for whatever reasons or excuses, they're simply not competing at a level high enough to win an NBA championship and they basically haven't been for about 6 out of the last 8 quarters they've played. \n\nThe Cavs, meanwhile, have complete confidence and certainty that they can win. They know exactly what they are doing, they're hustling, they're outrunning and out-jumping their opponent. They're trying to *win* \n\nThe entire season, the Warriors looked unbeatable, their style of play was too mobile, too versatile, too unpredictable. It knocked teams off rhythm and left some of the best players in the league stunned. But the Cavs look like they're just quite simply figured it out and the Warriors are going to have to really come up with some answers at this point to validate their season.\n\nUnbelievable turnaround. \n||59
How bad exactly is Iggy's injury? I think this might be the most important thing to note heading into Game 7. Is he day to day?|[DAL] Dirk Nowitzki|2
Not sure, but lower back issues can be pretty debilitating to play with even when they're fairly minor, where you can still suit up and get on the floor but everything is hampered by it. Best case scenario is he's getting a lot of rest between now and then and it calms down enough to give some real minutes.||1
While i completely agree with you on everything cavs doing right and dubs doing wrong.This entire series feels like all games are over when one team gets a 10 point lead.I mean there are flashes of comebacks but its more because stars are on the bench or playing unfocused.||5
Was Iggy hurt before this game? He looked to be at like 60% for the last half or so, but I hadn't noticed before they showed him going to the locker room for a bit, around half time I think.|Cavaliers|4
Yeah, they were talking about his back all night. He'd been getting extensive treatment on it and it kept seizing up in the first half as well. ||3
Let's be honest. Golden State hasn't played well consistently since the Portland Series.  Remember they were down 3-1 to OKC.  The role players won games 1 and 2 for them in this series as Steph and Klay were not very good. Now the role players have returned to earth and Harrison Barnes is just ridiculously bad.\n\n||8
OMG, Kerr totally bitching out the refs hardcore.  Literally said LeBron flopping and refs were garbage.  Said the MVP deserves more foul calls.\n\nThat's gonna cost him like $500,000 at least|Kings|125

You're right, and I'm amazed people are downvoting you. Klay talking about mans game and then walking out before the game is over, Curry throwing his mouthpiece, Kerr talking about Lebron's flops and Curry being okay to the media, and that's just from this game. Draymond and Bogut being dirty players, all the illegal screens they do, the fact that they hold and play physical every game but then whine when a team does it back to them and beats them at it. They're young and stacked, so they're arrogant and think they should always be winning. And when they don't, they get pissy and throw tantrums.||13
30 for 30|[LAL] Kareem Abdul-Jabbar|2
LeBron just showed that Draymond's suspension didn't matter a whole lot.|Cavaliers|10
Eh, I'm not going to disagree with the idea that if you only need to win 1 game out of 3, you fucking ought to and not bitch about the NBA. But tbf to the other side, Game 5 was pretty close until the third quarter and when they lost Bogut. \n\nDraymond's there, maybe Bogut doesn't get injured. Cavs might still even win, but a different turn of events. Same with if Draymond got suspended in the OKC series instead. Maybe it all works out evenly in the end but I think you can't just say that without context.\n\nEither way, Harrison Barnes should definitely keep forcing up shots.||14

Does it transfer Cleveland's Curse to the Warriors then? Losing with named moments after having a strong team...\n\nSeriously though, don't make Lebron mad. I've never seen Lebron as heated as he was after the swipe.|Cavaliers|3
I think the Cavs would've won anyways, Kyrie went off and Lebron hitting jumpers, things that Draymond wouldn't have impacted significantly.  I think it would've been closer, but I'm not going to take away from Kyrie's ridiculous performance.|Celtics|5

eh....no. I'll give you draymond not being suspended, but other than that Warriors have been generally getting far less fouls called for them than other teams. Bad calls both ways doesn't mean there isn't a significantly larger amount of bad calls going one way vs the other. Blatant fouls on curry and thompson not being called all game. That being said, you can't win a game having the first quarter going 31-11.||-15

I feel like Game 7 is going to be the absolute culmination for LeBron's entire career. Been labeled aa bit of a choker (by some) his whole career and always a very polarizing figure with where he falls on the list of all-time greatest NBA players. Now here he is, coming back from down 3-1, against the best regular season team in history, playing Game 7 on the road, and a chance to finally get Cleveland (his hometown team) a title. All year we thought this season was about the Warriors, but I think we might have been wrong. The Warriors were only a part of LeBron's story.\n\nNow having said that, the Cavs will maybe throw a stinker and it will wind up being about the Warriors and their resiliency after they win Game 7, but man I feel like we are living in the middle of what will become one of the greatest NBA stories ever. Just feels like a storybook ending is coming our way on Sunday...||30
Personally I dont think this will rid him of his choker label (undeserving), but add to his legacy in a different way, as the player that could do it all with little help (except Irving in places). He isnt really "anti-choking", he has been playing with so little pressure that he can play his game. But now with some added pressure this could get to him and in most people\'s eyes if he loses add to his "chokes"|Celtics|2
Both starting lineups come down with food poisoning before the game and the championship comes down to whoever is left standing.\n\nWHO SAW THAT COMING |[SAC] Oscar Robertson|2
Not despising the other players but he was the man that brought them to game 7. I agree with you. If he indeed gets a win on Sunday and brings that championship home, the fairytale will have a deserved triumphant ending regardless of what everyone says about him.||5
I understand how some people dislike him, but if he pulls this off there is no denying he is an all-time great. This will be the ultimate trump card over basically every argument against him. It won't necessarily make him better than Jordan but I think it firmly will put him right next to him as the two best ever.||2
Let's see if he is mentally prepared for what might be the biggest game of his career (who knows). Physically we all know he is, dominating like he did tonight. But a game 7 on the road, all on the line. Let's see, and quite frankly I'm hoping he pulls it off.||2

From the 5 minute mark of the 3rd quarter to the 2:26 minute mark of the 4th quarter [14 minutes 34 seconds], Lebron James scored or assisted on every single Cavs point [With the Exception of the Kyrie Irving Techincal Free Throw]. His stats during that time 25 pts 4 assists 3 rebounds 1 block. Wow.|[LAL] Kobe Bryant|90

Steve Kerr getting fined...||15
What did he say?  I missed it.|Trail Blazers|2
Said 3 fouls on Curry (and went through all of them individually) were inappropriate, especially when it fouls out an MVP. Even called out LeBron for flopping. Then went on to say Cleveland is holding Klay and Steph on cuts which disrupts their offense and then the Warriors get ticky tack calls on them. \n\nI'm sure the video will be up on here shortly.||1

Nah. I know it's easy to say, but if I were a Cavs fan I wouldn't really be all that phased by Game7 win or lose. They achieved what no team has done before: come back from a 3-1 deficit in the Finals. Against arguably the greatest team of all time. You might not get a ring, but this definitely means something.|Pistons|2
Please don't jinx this.|Lakers|2
You're an idiot to do that before Sunday |Cavaliers|2
I'm feeling this horrible combination of  excitement, dread, drunkenness, anxiety, and like I'm about to die. I love it. I need this ring. Might have to drive up from Columbus for the viewing.|Cavaliers|5

You must not have come to /r/nba in the last few days.|[LAC] Quentin Richardson|1

"we would have won game 5 if I was playing"|[CLE] Kyrie Irving|4
I will now go to the no Bogut excuse personally. |Supersonics|113
Yep, theres always ammo. After that its Iggys back. |Spurs|1
But Warriors fans told me that injuries were not an excuse for last Finals.|[LAC] Quentin Richardson|215
Only excuse that needs to be said is 11 points in the first quarter.\n\n\n11.\n\nPoints.\n\n...|Warriors Bandwagon|-4
You could say the same thing in reverse. The Cavs fans who said that the 2015 Finals were nullified because of injuries are now acting as though they beat the Warriors on a 100% level playing field. I don't think anyone should blame losses on injuries either way, but the hypocrisy runs both ways here.|Pistons|-3
I forgot, Andrew Bogut is just as valuable as Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love combined. Totally the same thing.|[LAC] Quentin Richardson|1
Well one of the primary reasons why Golden State has magically become nigh powerless to stop LeBron\'s penetration in the paint and why TT has suddenly become so dominant inside is the lack of Bogut\'s presence. Maybe you believe it\'s LeBron\'s killer instinct and Steph "choking" or whatever the heck you hear on First Take, but that\'s the truth. \n\nThat\'s not to say Cleveland didn\'t outplay Golden State in Game 5-6. They were more prepared and forced the Warriors into a ton of turnovers (along with early foul trouble last night). But to act as though Bogut\'s absence hasn\'t had a dramatic effect is just ridiculous, unless you haven\'t been paying attention.|Pistons|1
So you are saying that losing Bogut is equivalent to losing Kyrie and Love? This is what you are arguing, and you accuse me of being uninformed?|[LAC] Quentin Richardson|1
No, I never asserted that. The point I was making is that the losses don't necessarily have to be equivalent. You could grant that the Cavs faced more of a disadvantage while simultaneously recognizing that the loss of Bogut is a huge disadvantage to the Warriors. Go back and read my original comment to which you responded. I never equated the two teams' injuries; I was simply saying that both teams took a significant hit and the fans' reactions to them have been hypocritical. You took that to mean I was equating the injuries, so my response to you was a clarification of my original point.|Pistons|1
They're not an excuse, doesn't mean its not unfortunate.  And if the Cavs win on Sunday, they earned it. Cavs fans have been saying all year that last year was an asterisk championship which is a bit unfair.|Warriors|-3

#All those "Cavs when healthy" jokes sure backfired didn\'t they?\n\nLeBron Fucking James with yet another career-defining game. He just needed the help this year. \n\nCrazy how much his efficiency goes up when he\'s not responsible for literally every offensive possession huh? |Suns|157
Lol he is still 2-5 in finals. Have great games all you want but if you can't FINISH then what's it for? Stats?|Mavericks|-104
this is an incredibly stupid argument; the player/team that doesn't even make it to the finals is an even bigger loser than the player/team that makes it to the finals but loses.|NBA|2
Yes, because as we all know the Finals are a 1 on 1 streetball game where the best player wins every single time. Benches do not exist. Teams do not exist. There is only I in basketball.\n\nI would think the Mavs would be the least salty of the Lebron haters...|Cavaliers|6
He's got more rings and MVP awards than Dirk.|Cavaliers|16
Lol ok? |Mavericks|-18
A lot of those losses have been against the greatest teams of this generation.|[LAL] Kobe Bryant|10
Lol and? He hand picked his teams and still lost. |Mavericks|-13
Wait. Are we talking about Mark Cuban?|Spurs|6
Yeah he's wrong because he supports a team that didn't win good job detective||1
Wow this is mind numbingly dumb|Suns|40
he's got a point. I'm not saying lel lebron sucks dickkkk! cause putting b2b 41 points is anything but. However, it's for nothing if they don't get the trophy|Spurs|-35
Yes, but I don't see why he brought up that he can't finish series when he's already won twice |Suns|14
> he's got a point.\n\nI don't think so. It's a ridiculous assertion. But then, those who downvote him are probably of the opinion that 73-9 don't matter for shit if you don't win the ring (I also disagree with that) which is kinda hypocritical. |Celtics|21
Wait is the NBA suddenly 1v1? Because if it was LeBron would be like an 8 time champ by now.|Heat|15
They always come out at the funniest times, lmao.|Knicks|14
He's 2-4|NBA|24
My bad that sounds much better |Mavericks|-28
3-4 would sound a hell of a lot better especially when you look at who he played and with who.  The only series you can say he straight up choked was against you guys, last year he should have gotten mvp and this year he should regardless of what happens in 7.|Supersonics|11
Seriously. The 2011 loss was on him but 07 he was out matched. 2014 the Spurs weren't losing to anybody and 2015 he was outgunned due to injuries. \n\nHis finals losses shouldn't tarnish what is arguable a top 3-5 career in NBA history.|Hawks|4
I'm not saying he isn't amazing. But the entire cavs team feeds him the ball. Of course you are going to have high amounts of points if you are being fed the ball all game.||2
But he was responsible for nearly every offensive possession in the second half.|Raptors|6
But that's because he actually had someone to pass to\n\nLast year, there was no one good for him to pass to|Suns|5
To be fair the Cavs would probably be better if Love was injured again lol|Bulls|10
is he worse than the bench tho?  I don't think he's as much of a liability as some of the regulars from last season's Finals that didn't play at all until garbage time tonight.  Love on the court is definitely an upgrade over Mozgov or Delly... the issue is that Love is playing nowhere near what they're paying him; he's making Tristan Thompson look like an amazing deal.\n\nPlus Kyrie's performance (can argue he's outperforming Curry, and before tonight's second half, was probably ahead of James for Finals MVP) is enough to offset any lack of production from Love.|NBA|2
As a casual fan, I just want the city of Cleveland to get SOMETHING good this generation.||24
Kerr already campaigning for the refs favor in Game 7 as that fine keeps rising.||13
/s or not, cause I think shitting on the refs is a bad way to get them on your side, especially when your reasoning is that you can't call the league mvp for fouls. I think your being sarcastic but this is only my third finals I've watched so maybe it does make the refs more cautious. ||2
"HE\'S THE MVP, HE SHOULD GET BULLSHIT CALLS"|Heat|6
I just want to watch the NBA completely fuck with everyone and suspend Steph for Game 7||130

I might hang myself if that happens|Bucks|4
I still can't believe he let his emotions get to him like that. While I doubt the NBA does anything, he couldn't completely fucked over the Warriors in game 7... Same with draymond after yelling at the ref|Bucks|11
No reason to, they already got their g7. Who wins is irrelevant. Hype already sufficiently generated. ||7
no reason? just look at the NFL and deflategate; the amount of buzz such a controversial move would generate throughout the next few days and into the offseason would be off the charts for NBA standards|NBA|2
Yeah, and a g7 definitely has enough hype to draw views, doesn't need Curry for viewership. Probably not many people who would normally watch a g7 of the finals but wouldn't because Curry was out.\n\nCould be right. Still, even though I think the NBA has gotten up to some shady shit this post season, I don't think they're trying to rig the winner. Rig a g7? Maybe, but not the winner.||2
Literally nothing anyone would say after that moment would make any sense from here to the end of time. They'd fuck up every single possible narrative lol|Celtics|21

Kerr decided if he's going to be fined...he's really going to earn that fine |Cavaliers|11

The Ron Artest method? |NBA|1
It's hard for a finals game, but objectively speaking the calls did seem pretty bad. Not unbalanced though. |[BOS] Paul Pierce|11
Did you think the last two "fouls" on curry were actual fouls?|Cavaliers|0
Idr if they were the last two but the strip on Kyrie and the last one weren\'t fouls imo. But Love also had some soft fouls called on him early on in the first. All in all if they wanted to win maybe Harrison Barnes or Shaun Livingston could hit a shot/don\'t let them score 115. I understand Kerr\'s perspective though..usually they don\'t call those "ticky-tack" fouls on players of that caliber |[BOS] Paul Pierce|1
He only got the steal because he fouled Kyrie on the body before the foul. \n\nAll of his fouls, he got caught reaching and affecting the body of Cavs players, he needs to stop reaching if he doesn't want those fouls.|Cavaliers|1
Agreed. The first one on Tristan was a dumb foul.|[BOS] Paul Pierce|1
Close enough for it to not matter. |Charlotte Hornets|9
Kind of surprised no one is really talking about how curry is being targeted on defense. The cavs are abusing him right now and the warriors haven't really been able to adjust yet.|Trail Blazers|12
Yeah it kind of rubs me the wrong way when he gets called for fouls that have been committed on him all game. He never gets the call on jump shots when he gets hit, and he gets manhandled off ball||1
I think constantly getting burned on defense is part of what's making him so frustrated.|Timberwolves|1
They're just allowed to play more physical and are just turning into a wall when he tried to run by them on offense. I don't think he's accustomed to this physical of play.|[CLE] LeBron James|2

The reach in call when he stripped Kyrie was ridiculous. They could've called something on the bump before the strip. But the strip happened in the middle of the court on Kyrie's right side. The ref that called it was on Kyrie's left side by the sideline. \n\nHow can you possibly make that call? There's no way he could even see what happened. ||4
You could almost argue that 6 fouls against the Cavs in the first 5.5 minutes of the 2nd was what prevented the blowout from continuing.|Thunder|12
absolutely.|Cavaliers Bandwagon|5
Lebron paid the refs to put fouls on Kevin Love!|Mavericks|4
This is a conspiracy I can believe.||1
Agreed. And despite anyone's opinion on Curry's 6th foul, it was dumb of him to try for the ball like that knowing he has 5. ||4
So true. This dude is the definition of golden child. Why the hell would you even reach like that with 5 fouls and you're in the back court? Curry can only blame himself|Thunder|124
How is that good reasoning? If it wasn't a foul it wasn't a foul. The mental gymnastics is amazing |Knicks|-2
His team is down with 2:30 left,  he's gotta do something to get his team back in it. 3 of those fouls were ticky tack touch fouls, while klay and steph are getting grabbed and bumped all game long. That steal was as clean add they come. No way I blame this on curry ||1
Exactly! people saying his last 2 fouls were bullshit need to understand it's his own fault for putting himself in that position. Know who's reffing this game and realize that obviously with 4 and 5 fouls, shit just isn't going your way on defense. Time to play smart|[SAS] Tim Duncan|2
How else do you start a run with 5 minutes left? I wouldn't say it's rigged at all but that definitely is a questionable call. |Warriors|4
It's an even more questionable decision to reach. He was surrounded by 3 Cavs players, best case scenario they get 1 extra half court (not fast break) possession. Worst case, you lose your top scorer.|76ers|21
Then you haven't watched a warriors game all season.. He's done almost the same play all throughout the season! At the end of the day curry fouled out with 3 questionable calls. Not rigged but definitely frustrating for a finals game. \nAll I can say is this game 7 should be the showdown for the ages|Warriors|-8
If you knew the rules you would know they weren't questionable. His last foul wasn't about reaching.|Hornets|1
Sure a couple of the ones they called were questionable, but they also didn't call a few pretty obvious ones in the first half.|Cavaliers|4
Honestly bscause he's used to getting away with reaches |Mavericks|6
This is the correct answer. He was reaching all night, but it\'s "fuck it, let em play" basketball during the finals. ||7
And Warriors fans bitching about that call... need to check their privilege. |[LAC] DeAndre Jordan|7
Exactly. People go on and on about how it was a bad call, and I agree, but you gotta be smarter than that. |Kings|23
Total fouls isn't always the best indicator it'd when they happen. Curry getting two quick was huge, first one an obvious foul on him, second could have been a charge on lebron. Congrats you now have the two time MVP on the bench for more than half the quarter. Fouls 5 and 6 were super soft too.|Raptors|13
Exactly. You can't look at the number of fouls, you have to see the context.|Bulls|3
It's always the last fouls everyone remembers. What about Love basically fouling out straight away on a phantom call?||23
People definitely remember that but Love has been awful.||5
fouls shouldnt be judged based on the player, even if they are|Cavaliers|0
> Lebron got in curry's head. Stop saying it was rigged when both teams nearly had the same fouls, yall are just salty af \n\nNa man its clearly rigged. Lebron called up Silver and was like yo, suspend Dray and he got on his knees and did it. Then he said kick Steph out with 6 fouls and he made it so. Lebron just has too many connections. He told silver to make it so he puts up 40+ points, and it was so.|Knicks|340

Lebron with 41 points (16-27), 8 Rebounds, 11 Assists, 4 Steals, 3 Block, 1 TO. What a performance even by his standards.|[CLE] LeBron James|16
I did not see him doing it again. But, if he wants that title, he has to do it again. Kyrie might not be at his best in Game 7. He looked a bit hobbled and wasn't driving as much. \n\nStill, the Cavs built an early lead and by the time the Warriors were making runs, a few baskets here and there kept them at bay. |Magic|1
Kyrie's foot is definitely a concern. I think his offense will be fine, but he can't guard steph with a foot not at 100 percent. |Heat|1
Kerr is getting out coached. I like that he preaches patience but at what time will it light a fire underneath the Warriors? Cavs have found the same height weakness OKC had yet Kerr still is not adjusting to it. Varejao might flop a lot but he's the only big right now that gives Thompson any trouble. Barnes and Festus struggled on both ends of the floor tonight and Kerr kept them in too long. Barbosa has continuously proved he can handle more than garbage time minutes yet Kerr puts him in late af every game. Livingston should get more minutes solely so he can help on the defensive end. Curry/Green pick and roll which was their bread and butter during the season has all but mysteriously disappeared. We can keep being patient but that means we'll be patient through the Cavs lifting the trophy as well. |Warriors|30
They stopped using the Curry/Green pick and roll because it would be James switching onto Curry.... and we all saw how that ends.||1
I have to agree, him leaving Iggy out there who wasn't able to defend, rebound, shoot, jump was REALLY bad... there's no way another bench player would've done worse out there, he was a complete and total liability.|Pistons|1
The words "curry, green, roll, bread, and butter" so close together definitely confused me for a second.|Spurs|1
I think the issue is more defensive.  He's doing nothing to take the ball out of Kyrie and Lebron's hand. Doesn't the mantra have to be make JR Smith and Jefferson beat you instead of hoping Kyrie and Lebron are off?\n||1
Barbosa scares the shit out of me.|Cavaliers|2
Awe it looked like Sager was tearing up. |Vancouver Grizzlies|18

Game 7 will be really good, last time warriors were put against the wall in do or die they play their hearts out, so should the cavs, oh baby|Cavaliers Bandwagon|8

LeBron also had 5 blks and 3 stls... Jesus. ||8
In Steve Kerr\'s post game interview he kept mentioning how he couldn\'t believe they\'d call "the MVP of the league" on specific fouls. Is he implying that Steph, as great a player as he is, is supposed to get special treatment in terms of officiating? I\'m having trouble wrapping my head around this.|Cavaliers|7
you act like superstars dont get special treatment are you that delusional?||1
Should it be something coaches argue for though?\n\n"My best player should get preferential treatment."|Cavaliers|3
Exactly this. I'm not saying they don't get special treatment, I'm saying arguing that your player should is ridiculous.|Cavaliers|1
Basically.  Usually stars in the league can get away with a little more but Steph wasn't getting the extra leeway on a few calls. ||1
who knew richard jefferson would become so important? he's just like shane battier out there.|Clippers|7
It's crazy. It really is. Must be powers from Lil Kev. |[CLE] LeBron James|3
Why is it that when the dubs lose to any teams this playoffs, it always seems that they aren't the same team who got a historic 73-9 in the regular season?|Heat|6
Hmmm, maybe it's because when you lose you usually don't play well?|Celtics|3
Finals predictions: LeBron dunks on Curry in overtime for the win so hard that Ayesha divorces him.|Cavaliers|6
Neutral guy at the game here. Just seeing the Cleveland fans after the game really makes me want the Cavs to get the title. There was so much fucking joy on the way back|[NYK] Dick Bunt|21
After watching Believeland I'm rooting for Cleveland too. |Trail Blazers|8
You should\'ve seen it. Every damn car was honking with fans cheering. There were chants and a ton of "fuck steph curry"s. I gave high fives to hundreds of people I\'ve never met and will probably never see again. It was unreal|[NYK] Dick Bunt|8
"neutral" ||0
I came in neutral, but fuck i'm leaning towards the cavs now for the finals|[NYK] Dick Bunt|1
Game 7 watch party is at Progressive Field. If we win... I can't wait man. I was at the game tonight too. Walking down E4th, people hanging out windows, high fiving... I'm so excited. I hope LeBron gets one for the Land.|[CLE] Zydrunas Ilgauskas|3
I do too. Hopefully I get to see the Knicks do the same eventually. As much as I kinda hate you guys for quite frankly being good I can relate to you guys a ton. Once NY wins a championship the city will be just as ecstatic as you guys in the Land.  |[NYK] Dick Bunt|1
You have the Yankees and the Giants. The Knicks have won more recently than any Cleveland team. Appreciate the kind words, though. We're not often on the same side.|Cavaliers|2
I'm a jets fan, but regardless that is very true. I was only thinking about basketball when I commented. Sorry about that!|[NYK] Dick Bunt|1
I was at Game 6 of the ECF in 2007 which sent us to our first Finals in franchise history. It was essentially exactly what you described. It was nearly 10 years ago and I still remember it like it was yesterday.|[CLE] LeBron James|4

Sounds like me half the time I write a comment on reddit...I read it and I am just like yeah this sound stupid|Cavaliers|2
Lebron talking to Craig after the game was amazing. Two of the all-time greats.||20
It's interviews like that one that make me question my hate for him, but then I just watch him on the court and it all comes flooding back.  I hate that bitch!|Trail Blazers|0
LeBron was a beast tonight. Back to back 41 point games? Damn!||32

There was a moment when Craig Saiger painted a mental picture of a victorious homecoming for Lebron and you could see him almost tear up at the thought.  Cavs fan or not you have to respect that kind of drive.|Bucks|7

Everyone talking about how the officials rigged it... Both teams had 25 fouls, how is calling the same amount of fouls for both teams rigging it?|Mavericks|6
I think cavs won fairly but think about it, it would be fairly simple to get the calls close to even if you are the refs|Heat|1
Just because the fouls were even doesn't really mean anything. There were bad calls both ways though. |76ers|2
Agreed.  Cavs played better last night--it happens.  I've seen games with innumerable bad calls or calls that were heavily skewed toward one team.  Last night was not one of those games.||3
Thank you! There were some missed calls and bad calls both ways. Anyone saying the game was rigged is just used to preferential treatment.|Mavericks|2
The Cavs might actually make history winning after 3-1|Spurs|38
If there was ever a time this was it. Key player suspended for game 4 to steal home court, one of the teams biggest pieces gets injured, and a great showing at home (not that it would have mattered anyway but I am salty about that 6th curry foul).\n\nI doubt any of the other teams down in the Finals 1-3 have had a chance as good as this one.|Warriors|-10
5th was huge too, that's most likely a lay up for curry on the steal and changes momentum |Raptors|2
Can you imagine how big that would be for Lebron's legacy? Beating a 73-9 team in the finals after going down 3-1? Jesus|Warriors|18
It's by far the cooler story.  73-9 team, down 3-1... first unanimous mvp, coach of the year... no team ever coming back from 3-1.  Has everything, so much so I can't really believe it happens.|Pistons|2

I saw a tear on his cheek, it made me have a tear on my cheek. |Rockets|1

Yo, if Golden State pulls a Cleveland and absolutely blows this series, does Cleveland's curse is broken and all their bad sports mojo just up and move to the Bay Area?\n\nEither way, if the Cavs win this I'm betting a hunnid on the Browns winning the Super Bowl.|Bulls|13
It's ok to be excited but lets not get crazy.||1

No matter who wins the cavs absolutely unequivocally deserve it. And I know that the cavs will win it. In fact I will donate $500 dollars to the charity of the top comments choice on the next game thread if the Warriors win. I will shave my eyebrows and wax my whole body too. The cavs will 100% win.

are we going to pretend like they would've called a 6th foul on lebron or kobe in the final 5 mins of the game?|Lakers|-1
are we going to pretend like Curry isn't a favorite of the NBA? he's constantly got a lot of benefit of the doubt calls these last few years.  Stupid on him for getting that aggressive with the refs calling fouls left and right on both teams.  Watching how quickly they put fouls on Love should've been notice to everyoen that it was gonna be a quick whistle.|Pistons|1

damn good game cavs. you guys buried us in the 1st and that was the difference. nothing to do with refs. even if people believe calls were one sided, that wasn't why we lost. 31-11 is why we lost.\n\nwe are gonna come out firing in game 7 and hopefully we get a close game.|Warriors|22

i mean i am not gonna assume we're done after this game. but we played y'all very well after the 1st and were able to steal some momentum for some decent runs. if not for the first quarter, this game would have been decided by less than 5 (one way or another). \n\ni think this series puts an emphasis on why it is important to try to be the best regular season team. if we were going to cleveland for game 7, this series would basically be over. but our home court advantage is pretty salty and our bench has a notorious reputation for showing up at oracle.|Warriors|3

So LeBron's game has to be one of the greatest single game finals performances ever right? Do you guys think it's top 30? Top 20?||5
Wasn't his last game better? |Warriors|1
In as much as it hurts to say it, good game by the Cavs. Hopefully the Dubs win game 7.|Warriors|6
Kerr gon get fined|Rockets|5
Game 7's are usually always blowouts, but at the same time it's at Oracle but Clelveland is 1 game away from a title and that means CLeveland is going to play like their lives depend on it. This shit will be a good game I feel, but I think Cavs might barely pull out with a win, even though I want GSW to win It's hard to see Cavs lose now with all their effort.|Spurs|6
Plus cavs have won at their own homecourt in an elimination game, which is close to the intentisity of a game 7.|Cavaliers|0
Lebron James. Legend. A man amongst boys.|Trail Blazers|4
I didn't see the press with Kerr. Can someone tell me if when he said Curry's fouls were inappropriate, did he mean BECAUSE he was MVP or did he mean an MVP shouldn't commit fouls like that?||7
They were ticky tacky.  As a ref u have 2 choices.  Let them play or call ticky tacky fouls.  For the most part refs let them play, but there were a lot of ticky tacky calls that were like what?!||1
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J413mcMFRqA Kerr postgame, if curious.|[CLE] Mark Price|2
Because he is the MVP||2
I'm honestly not sure. But leaving it open ended like that doesn't look good.|Suns|2
BECAUSE he was the MVP. Basically you can't foul the MVP out on calls like that.||5
Because he was MVP they were bad calls. That's what he's saying||5
Damn then that's fucked up||2
It would be except for the fact that LeBron gets that treatment||1

If game 5 was given to the Cavs to extend the series, game 6 was *taken* by the Cavs. Right from the start, they were switched on and ready to fight. Warriors looked a bit stunned, as if having Green back in itself was going to secure them another easy win.\n\nReally can't wait for game 7 now. Great series!|Timberwolves|7
Can't believe they're blaming refs when Warriors missed their first 7 or 8 shots. ||3
I'm rooting for the Warriors but the refs didn't cost them the game, their bad habits did.  \n\nThey gambled on steals, swiped at balls in the back court, shot hero shot balls, and just didn't get back on defense.  \n\nEvery run they made was ended by one or more of those habits and that's why they lost.    |Lakers|12
This. You're losing and you're jacking up contested 30ft shots? Why?|Clippers|1
I think it looks really bad when a coach is trying to call out players on the opposing team for flopping like Steve Kerr just did in the post game. Varejoa is on you're freaking team dude. Not to mention curry has been flopping quiet a lot this series, and it was a foul. Pompous as fuck. ||11
I'm losing respect for Kerr right now.||15
I lost respect for him earlier in the series. |Rockets|1
Shitty that we've lost two straight but so proud of the comeback the Dubs put on. Great couple of games for the Cavs, this game 7 is gonna be brutal|[GSW] Andrew Bogut|45
I hate it when any team i root for is playing the dubs. I don't stop holding my breath unless we're up by 30 in the 4th, and even then i wouldn't be surprised if they came back. |Heat|2
That end to the 3rd quarter scared the shit out of me|Cavaliers|4
I really thought this was going to be a 30 game blowout, so it was impressive to see the Warriors come within 7-11 points behind the Cavs. |Hawks|3
I got out of an exam during halftime (I'm in Australia), looked up the box score and facepalmed|[GSW] Andrew Bogut|2
JOIN THE DELLY SIDE OF THE FINALS |[CLE] Matthew Dellavedova|9
I know this thread will all be memes so I'll give my assessment of the game:\n\n* Not having Bogut is killer. LeBron carved the paint easily.\n\n* Warriors shooting was garbage, aside from Curry. No more explanation needed.\n\n* Thompson was godlike on the glass. Best player on the court besides LeBron.\n\n* Love was effective in limited time.\n\n* Draymond Green complaining all game long (screaming) shows who the real bitch is.\n\n* Steph Curry *should* be suspended for throwing his mouthguard into the stands. Any other player at any other point would be suspended. He won't be.\n\n\n**Side Note outside of game**\n\n* Ayesha Curry calling the Finals rigged for ratings is probably the funniest thing of this entire series.\n\n|Heat|95
> Any other player at any other point would be suspended.\n\nlol you can't be serious with this|[DAL] Rodrigue Beaubois|1

Why would anyone be suspended for throwing a mouthpiece? Unless you're saying he specifically threw it at a fan? And either way I don't see how that could possibly be an automatic suspension for anyone. |Pistons|2
> Steph Curry should be suspended for throwing his mouthguard into the stands. Any other player at any other point would be suspended. He won't be.\n\nI'd agree in any other game.  But game 7 of the Finals between GOAT-status Lebron and the winningest single-season team of all time?  No.|Celtics|9

Good thing you don't know the rules then, because this is a fine not a suspension.|Celtics|2
> I'd agree in any other game. But game 7 of the Finals between GOAT-status Lebron and the winningest single-season team of all time? No.\n\nShouldn't give preferential treatment to a player just because of the situation. People have been suspended for it before, and it'd be bull if Curry isn't suspended for it now.||4
I would really like to know who was suspended for it and if there was a rule for it?\n\nI don't want curry to be suspended because I want to see an epic game 7, and if the championship is going to mean anything the MVP has to be playing.\n\nEdit: The only case I could find for someone being suspended was Amir Johnson in 2012. The difference being he threw it at the ref instead of at the stands... It was also a much weaker throw.\n\nhttp://www.nba.com/2012/news/12/11/torontos-amir-johnson-suspended/||2
Udonis Haslem was suspended for a playoff game for chucking his mouthguard. It was actually more innocuous than Curry's.||2
The last incident of a mouth guard toss I\'m aware of was Enes Kanter chucking one into the crowd in 2014. He was not suspended, but was given a tech and fined 25 grand. So precedent for suspension isn\'t there and nobody wants to see game seven without the best players on the court.\n\nThat said the NBA is wrong on that one. While a drool covered mouth guard flying into the crowd is probably more "gross" than "dangerous" if the chances of it being potential hazard to a fan is any non-zero number no matter how low, and I imagine it is, a player who does that must be removed from the game immediately and suspended. On court players being any potential hazard to fans at all is unacceptable. \n\nThis doesn\'t make Steph suddenly a super-villain IMO, he certainly has a longer resume of being a good rep for the league, role model, whatever you will. But he\'s gonna get a lot of flack for that incident in the coming weeks and he deserves it, and no matter what he thought of that sixth foul call or how sick he gets of being asked about it his answer needs to be nothing other than, "I was completely wrong to do that, I\'m sorry, and nothing like that will ever happen again."|Pacers|5
No fucking way should Curry be suspended, I'm rooting for Cleveland but that would be the biggest disgrace in sports if they take out the biggest key player for something so chicken shit and meaningless.|Clippers|7
To be fair, he was the chicken shit in that situation.|Cavaliers|1
>Love was effective in limited time.\n\nMaybe on offense, but once again, dude was a massive liability on defense. He just doesn't know how to guard klay/steph. He is either over aggressive or not aggressive enough and creates a lane for them to drive in. |Heat|7
Exactly, Klay's run in the 3rd quarter was all pretty much due to Kev making dumb plays on defense |[CLE] Kyrie Irving|3
I disagree. He wasn\'t horrid in this game compared to his other games and I think he actually did a great job of boxing out for Defensive boards which is an underrated "stat".|Heat|3
I'll agree with that, he wasn't letting smaller guys get the best of him in the paint for rebounds like he did in game 5|Heat|3
LeBron is undisputed top 5 to ever play even if he never wins another title||24

I don't know if it's recency or what but I'm fully convinced he's better than Kobe|[SAS] Tim Duncan|10
of course he's better than kobe lol. not even a question at this point.||1

ok ok, easy there|Bucks|1
I dunno, these Finals have been pretty damn boring. No game has ended within single digits.|Lakers|4
either the Cavs come back down 3-1 to beat the team with the most wins ever or the Dubs cap off arguably the best season of all time against a basketball cyborg whose settings are cranked through the roof right now. \n\nI dunno man, this game is about to be bonkers.|Wizards|1
Yeah, the stage that has been set is pretty exciting, but the games themselves have just not been very interesting. They've all been one sided and the reffing has been so frustratingly inconsistent. It has been pretty hard to stay engaged while watching.|Lakers|1
Just because neither team has been consistent doesn't mean this hasn't been a great series with historic implications|Bulls|3
I understand that, but the games themselves have just not been interesting to me at all. A team usually gets a double digit lead in the first quarter and keeps it the whole time. Game 6 was the most exciting but that got shut down pretty quickly when Steph got his 6th foul.|Lakers|2
I mean the dubs came pretty close to cming back, it was definitely a nailbiter there for a bit, even if the lead never got below 8. |Heat|2
This has been the most exciting game so far. But the first half was a massacre, and the last couple minutes after Steph Curry fouled out (bullshit call btw) were pretty much garbage time. There was like 1.5 quarters that were fun.|Lakers|2
2010 Game 7?|Thunder|3
I'm glad Draymond sat this game out to allow LeBron to score 41 again|Cavaliers|20
If he stayed on he would have done something to get suspended for Game 7|[GSW] Marreese Speights|2
LeBron James, the poor kid sleeping on a couches in middle and high school vs. a privileged pre-madonna Steph Curry in game 7. I for one vote LeBron. Dude has fought against the odds and haters. Curry reminds me of all the rich entitled kids I grew up playing against. ||20
That's bullshit. I'm a Lebron fan first and foremost but let's not act like just because Steph didn't grow up poor that he didn't work his ass off everyday to get to where he is now. I watched the whole game and even I thought that last foul against him was absolute nonsense. Let's give credit where credit is due and not discount a player just because they had a moment of well deserved frustration and anger. ||1
No one is discounting anyone. Lebron James literally represents the american dream. Came from nothing, had no father in his life and a drug addict mom and grinded it out to make it to the top. Sure hes athletically gifted, but you can't obtain his athleticism sitting on the couch eating cheetos. Steph grew up in the NBA. He was playing 1v1s against Vince Carter as a kid. You tell me which situation is more likely to make it to the NBA. Yes Steph worked hard, but he simply had more opportunities growing up than Lebron.  Dude literally is a rags to riches tale and he did it with hardwork and talent. What is even more telling, he did this all with ridiculous expectations(and criticism) and he met and even exceeded them. Don't get it twisted, I respect both Steph and Lebron for what they have accomplished. But to compare the adversity that Steph has faced with the adversity that Lebron has faced is downright disrespectful. ||3
Yet Curry's entire story is one of redemption. No one expected him to be where he's at. He had such a struggle, y'know being able to practice in NBA gyms as a youngster is tough!\n\nPlease. |[CLE] LeBron James|3
Lebron won the genetic lottery thou.  Curry probably spent 50,000 hours perfecting that jump shot.   Both work hard.||5
Lebron works hard too, talent doesn't always mean you'll be the best player without some hard work.|Cavaliers|0
Just one of the reasons I love LeBron. I live about 30 miles south from where LeBron grew up. My son made it out of the hood too with some help from college football. I too was a teenage mother. You can't believe how happy I am for LeBron. ||5

I'm a huge GOT fans and episode 9's are usually epic but c'mon man you can just stream it later.||2
This is why DVR is a thing.||2
As if there's a choice. GoT is on HBO Go, Game 7 of the NBA Finals is only live once.|Clippers|5
Its not even a choice man, there\'s this new thing called "on demand." Watch Game of thrones later.||38
HBOGO is the shit.|Raptors|2
HBO GO is the worst streaming app ever. Can\'t add an entire series to your watch list. No "watch next episode" button. \n\nHBO GO is not the shit. ||0
It's got Game of Thrones on demand. \n\nThat's all I fuckin care about. Especially this Sunday. \n\nAlso, the next episode prompt comes up when the show gets towards the end.|Raptors|3

Rawr mutha fucka|Cavaliers|1
don't care if cavs win game 7 or not, Lebron has successfully defended the land and proved that he's still the king|Clippers|9
exactly dudes still the best player in the leauge folks saying curry the best LMAO||1
sad part is, if he loses game 7, even if it's close, all people will say is 2-5 and completely disregard the performance he's put on....still can't understand why he gets so much hate |Celtics|2
I'm actually amazed. People really think this series is fixed. I don't have any words|Bucks|10
Yeah the refs really helped Cavs open a 20pt lead in the first.\n\nPeople are so dumb.|Cavaliers Bandwagon|3
Even if GSW win Game 7, I still feel they don't deserve it. \n\nI felt OKC outplayed them 24 quarters out of 28 quarters in that WCF series.\n\nNow in the Finals, I see that Lebron and Kyrie are much, much hungrier and showed more heart than anybody on the Warriors team.  ||10
If they don't deserve the title after winning Game 7, who does?|Wizards|1
I feel like heart and hunger play no factor in winning finals games. Do you really think Curry wasnt hungry for the win tonight? Or that Lebron wasnt hungry every single game last years finals. Eveyone at this point wants to win no matter what. Thats why the refs are getting abused by the players. Either team deserves to win its just that you forget about the first 2 games where they destroyed the Cavs for the whole game|Celtics|2
I'm just sitting here in the office, upvoting everything.|[CLE] Shaquille O'Neal|10
Except for the Warriors fans complaining about the refs I hope.|Cavaliers|2
[chucks it up]|[SAC] Oscar Robertson|2
I'd like to take this time to ask the basketball gods to please allow LeBron to have a monster game 7 and win one for the land. Also basketball gods, if I'm not asking too much, could you please make Curry have a bad game? Amen.\n|Spurs|10
Can i ask the basketball gods for a monster game by both lebron/curry followed closely by insane shots from kyrie/klay and unexpected clutch shots from both benches 39 lead changes and 69 ties defensive physicality and jabbering ending in double ot and not care who wins?I just want 1 game out of 7 to be competitive throughout 4 quarters.||2
Lebron played amazing, but I really think Tristan Thompson deserves a shoutout for his play. Dude is all hustle. |Cavaliers|10
He is a fucking monster, his dunks are just downright heavy. I'm really impressed with his play this series||3
I'm not gonna get much sleep before Sunday. This feels like the apex for Lebron in terms of legacy. I know the Warriors are at home but I feel like Lebron is on a mission and there's nothing you can do. |Knicks|9

It would be hard to argue against it but he will never be #1.|Jazz|2
But would you vote Draymond for finals MVP? /s||2
So after 6 games Lebron is at the top of BOTH teams in scoring, assists, rebounding, steals, and blocks. \n\n\nJesus Christ. \n\nOne day, we are going to brag to our children and to our grandchildren that we saw Lebron in his prime. \n\n\n|76ers|4

You come at the King, you best not miss.||5
Why does he keep saying that the mvp of the league shouldn't get calls on him? I agree that at least one of those calls wasn't a good call but it shouldn't matter if he is mvp or not? ||6
I legit don't understand how people are going to talk themselves into wagering on game 7. JVG said the Warriors would be heavily favored at home and I understand why but holy shit, good luck slowing down a pissed off 4 time MVP with a hobbled Iguodala.||6
Without bogut though, the warriors don't have any rim protectors other then the flopper varejao. Lebron was just eating up the paint tonight.|Cavaliers|2
Now golden state knows how OKC felt||6
Fuck yes! King James brings down 41 pts again |Cavaliers|6

I'm almost certain Kyrie is a Ninja, I bet his resting hear rate is sub 45 BPM. ||4
So if the Cavs end up losing on Sunday (not saying they will) will LeBron still be known as "choker"? I personally have never really considered him a "choker", but I just wanted here your thoughts. |[POR] Damian Lillard|6
No. But a 2-5 record in the Finals in unshakable. MJ was 6-0, Kobe was 5-2. So... Yeah. ||-2
"EXACTLY."\n\n- Robert Horry|[SAC] Oscar Robertson|1
Yeah NBA finals are all that matters.  Jerry West 1-8 and is the logo.  Bill Russell 11 rings, in his 13 year career, and everyone puts him over Jordan right? Rings matter big time but the "rings are the only measurement" fans don\'t know anything about basketball.  Lebron has so much work to do to be the greatest in any book but no matter what happens he\'s a great player and 30 years from now his finals record won\'t be the only thing remembered when people talk about him.  He\'s the best player in this generation.  \n\nBy generation I don\'t mean greater than Kobe or anything like that either (I\'m a big Kobe fan too) because he will play at least 5-6 years if not more longer than him.  I do love people not giving Lebron credit though and acting like Kobe and MJ did it all by themselves.  Remember 2010? Kobe folded in game 7 and Pau, Andrew Bynum and Meta went off for the lakers to win.  Espically Bynum and Pau ( their length killed the Celtics). Meta even hit the game winning three in game 7.  Revisionist history man, we all love to do it.  Great players often have great help.|Cavaliers|2
only the morons on facebook will say that|Lakers|2
Anyone who thinks that still is an idiot.||4
Dumb.  I don't care how many rings you have or how many times you've failed to get a ring: Making the NBA finals is not a joke, nobody can take that away from you (unless you're Barnes or KLove...).|Warriors|4
Glad to see I'm not alone \n\n>unless you're Barnes or KLove\n\nlol|[POR] Damian Lillard|3
I don't know about anybody else, but it looks like Golden State has nothing left in the tank.\n\nIggy's banged up, lots of their guys missing easy shots and just a general lack of drive. On top of that, i think the Cavs are in their heads too. Lots of really dumb fouls taken by the Warriors tonight. \n\nGolden State may have won the physical battle through the first 3 or so games, but it looks like the Cavs may have won the mental battle in the next 3. That looms large, especially when you have to go up against a pissed off LeBron.|Raptors|4
Warriors hit a 3, get a stop, get a another 3 to start the game and the crowd starts going bonkers, their swag will be back at 1000. ||5
Yeah, but Cavs have been halting their runs and subsequently managing the crowd effect really well this series. |Timberwolves|2
True theyve hit timely shots. Just saying I wouldn't favor the cavs with the warriors at home. Unless Iggy can't play, then they're in big trouble ||1
I favour Cavs if LeBron's outside shot is dropping...but it's impossible to predict if that'll be the case. |Timberwolves|5
Yeah if he can hit from 18+ feet it's game over. That's when he is truly unstoppable. I would love to see it ||2
Yeah but it will be Harrison Barnes taking those 3s to try and get his confidence back ...||4
He was having a good playoffs before the last two games. He can def have a redemption game ||2
I can't believe people were waiting on Draymond Green to come back and do nothing|NBA|4
This game 7 has the potential to be an all time classic. So much on the line: Gsw validating their 73 win season or Lebron bringing the championship back home. Whatever the result, I just wanna see a great game and am thankful for such an epic series that has been surprisingly tight despite the blowouts.|Bulls|7
LeBron should have played like this since Game 1. He SHOULD have. Should have been the Champs now.||5
I think Cavs will do the "impossible" in game 7. The Warriors just seem mentally weak and cannot gather themselves properly. The bench outside of Barbosa really did not give the Warriors much help. |Spurs|4
It's like people are forgetting this is Cleveland!!! \n\nBoth teams could be scoring on the same basket for Cleveland and Cleveland will still lose. |Cavaliers|1
Cavs will win game 7. With Bogut out it's so easy for Lebron and Kyrie to get to the rim.||6
You're forgetting one thing, and it's pretty much the only thing that matters.\n\n\nIt's Cleveland. |Cavaliers|3
You're so right||1
Remember when everyone was asking if GSW were better than the '96 Bulls? |Celtics|5
I stopped asking that after they went down 3-1 to OKC. OKC should have won that series, and I certainly don't consider them an all time great team.|[BOS] Tony Delk|1
Yes. And it was a completely fair question. |76ers|1
It's gonna be interesting to see if anyone makes that argument if the Warriors win Game 7.||1
They were so poor today though, just awful, hard to imagine they could be an all-time great team after that. I don't know, I've only seen highlights from '96 so maybe it's as they say, history being written by the winners.|Celtics|1
Yeah, the thing that hurts them is the 1996 Bulls, and other ATG teams like the 1986 Celtics or 2001 Lakers, were never on the brink of elimination like these Warriors have been twice.||1
Warriors best players literally hitting people in the nuts, throwing mouth guards at fans, having their daddies and wives complain about refs and Lebron and still it'll be Lebron that the media tears to shreds if he scores under 30 in game 7. Fuck the Warriors. Go cavs|Cavaliers Bandwagon|33
Klay also left the game early, because he got his feelings hurt.|Cavaliers|7
"This is a man\'s game."|Cavaliers Bandwagon|2
FULL CIRCLE YOU GUYS, OKC UP 3-1 only to lose the series, time for Cavs to do the same!|Lakers|14

Literally the most unsportsmanlike group... I cannot believe it.\n\nCurry - yelling and throwing his mouth guard, hitting a FAN\n\nKlay - literally LEAVING the game\n\nKerr - publicly saying that the league MVP shouldn\'t have calls like that made against him (is that what he\'s saying? regardless it\'s tacky)\n\nMrs. Curry - tweeting how the NBA is rigged and promptly deleting it... Like after she is constantly preaching being "classy" \n\n\nI get it. It\'s the Finals. The Warriors are frustrated, they got outplayed. But this... These are your most public faces and they are not serving you well AT ALL. Honestly, I expect more from them, just as players, coaches, and family. \n\n\n\nJesus.

I will say one thing..IF the Cavs lose Game 7, Lebron will take that loss harder than he's ever taken one. He's thrown his heart and soul into this series.|Spurs|7
That city's been through so much. I don't think they recover if they lose Sunday. Lebron is going super Saiyan and now they're one win away from being world champions. There's only so much heartbreak a city can take.||2
As my non-Cavs fan friend put it: "I hope Cleveland wins just to save some guy in Cleveland from hanging himself with his Johnny Manziel jersey."|NBA|2

LeBron if you read this, the GS gameplan is letting you score assuming your jumper sucks. If you make jumpers, we win the series. Every time they have a press conference they make a point of saying how much they don't care about him scoring. He needs to be 70% from 2 or hit outside shots and apparently they have no gameplan. |Cavaliers|6
Looks like Curry got a little too spicy for the ref lol.||5

Haha I don't really watch that show. It just popped instantly in my head after he threw his mouthpiece. Maybe because I was hungry.||2
Dont think that last foul was one on Curry, but at the end of the 2nd half after he picked up 3 Steph got away with way more contact than he usually does. It all evens out in the end. |Cavaliers|4
I mean that sixth foul was soft and the refs have been so unpredictable this series. But what was he thinking pressuring LBJ there. He reaches LeBron teaches. All of Stephs fouls seem to be him not moving his feet and reaching in. Regardless of if you draw contact a lot of times it just looks like a foul\n||1

I know it\'s the Lakers "thing" to hate on Gilbert for that letter, but the rest of the owners voted the trade down too. He didn\'t do anything single handedly.|Cavaliers|1
From the reports I've read around the time, he was the one who insisted more vehemently on vetoing the trade. because he wanted to have his cake and eat it too.\n\nwe're talking about a guy who hated on queen james to the media when he went to the Heat to turn around and receive him with open arms when the queen wanted to sulk on a different team.\n\nthere is no way I'm liking or even respecting the Cavs after the shady shit they did.|Lakers|1

Doesn't DirecTV offer local channels though in their packages?|[GSW] Donyell Marshall|1
I get it at home but something must be up for the bars because like I said 3 of them told us they didn't get the game before we had to go to Bdubs. I've never experienced this before but it happened on game 3 when I went out for dinner also, but at that time I just assumed it was that single place. 3 different places last night, somethings up ||1
Its ABC. If you have basic cable you have ABC. Unless you are not in America those places just didn't want to show the game. ||3
That's what I'm sayin! I've never heard of this bs before. They all were sayin something about their direct tv package ||1
there's no way lol. |76ers|2
I swear dude. I went to 3 different bars/restaurants before going to Bdubs||2
They probably thought it was on ESPN.... Shoulda have told them.\n\nJust did some quick googlefu and it's possible ABC were being cucks and refusing to let direct tv broadcast their channel without more money.... Even though it's supposed to be free for everyone.|[BOS] Tony Delk|1
Trust me, I wouldn't keep bouncing to all these different places without knowing the Channel lol||1
If you have an antenna you have abc, don't even need cable. It's free.||1
I'm sorry but there's no way in hell curry is better than lebron. lebron just coasts through the reg season now because he's old.||13

Steph gets hate for being "too perfect" and "too civil," now he gets hate for being so competitive that he\'s pissed off at a BS foul. Dude can\'t win.|Spurs|6
Throwing your mouthpiece at the fans is not an appropriate reaction. He played very sloppy tonight and deserved to foul out.\nIt was other things too. After his fifth foul, he took the ball and ran to the opposite side of the court. A lesser player would have been hit with a delay of game technical and kicked out.|Wizards|-1
But that final foul was bs.  He definitely lost his cool, but that was basically ending gsw's chances in the game.|Trail Blazers|2
How did he deserve to foul out? Not gonna argue about throwing the mouthpiece, but he had some major bullshit fouls called on him. Not to mention missed calls when people would run into him after his shots.|Lakers|5
There were a couple of bullshit no calls that he got away with. The only foul he can complain about was the blocking/charge. All the others were correct.|Wizards|-1
I disagree entirely that they were correct. There were some objectively bad calls.|Lakers|6
The reach in and #6 where close calls IMO. But either way why is he playing so risky with 4 or 5 fouls?|Cavaliers|1
I also thought the 2nd foul where it was a block/charge call should\'ve gone against LeBron. He lowered his shoulder and Curry was pretty decently set. In terms of being risky, they were down by 12 with just over 4 minutes to go, you kind of need to take risks at that point. Even then, it only seemed like a risk because he got called for a foul. If LeBron got called for a foul, it would have been "great defense".|Lakers|1
> After his fifth foul, he took the ball and ran to the opposite side of the court. A lesser player would have been hit with a delay of game technical and kicked out.\n\nLebron has literally done the exact same thing twice in his Finals history. And neither time was he called for anything.|Spurs|5
There's competitive, and there's throwing the mouthpiece that never seems to be in his mouth anyways.|NBA|1
Lebron being such a nice/civil guy in post interview game, he literately counters all the haters here.||14
You'd think so...|Cavaliers|1
Fouls: 25-25\n\nBut clearly, it's rigged because Curry gambles multiple times and gets judgement calls against him that we see get called every game in the NBA. |Cavaliers|20
What are you doing reaching not once but twice with 5 fouls?  What a mentally weak midget.|Cavaliers|1
It's not so much the calls but the consistency.  This game was nothing like 1-5.|Spurs|2
I don't disagree. If you look through my history at half I said the officiating was garbage. It's not that I think it was GOOD officiating, it's that the officiating shows no signs of being lopsided or rigged, just generally bad. |Cavaliers|1
True, but it was pretty clear right from the get go the refs were gonna be quick on the whistle. That part was consistent.|Pistons|2
I will concede they were at least consistent through out the game.|Spurs|1
The dude reaches every time someone dribbles around him. They all do. That little reach-around slap that never gets called.|Cavaliers|4

Bron still the best player in the NBA...fight me|Hawks|9
Is it safe to say that this game is a legacy defining performance for Lebron and if they win game 7 then it would just bring him to a new holy shit, Michael Jordan level? Like I wasn't around for Jordan when he was awesome, but I'm pretty sure he never had to go up against a team as stacked as the Warriors. And what Lebron has done already (just in the last 2 years, not to mention his career before The Return) is just amazing to watch. Idk, I'm kinda drunk right now, but oh my god... Somebody say something...||7
I grew up during the Jordan era and honestly he was way more dominant than LeBron- when he played you never thought he would lose- you expected season highlights every game, that's not meant to diminish LeBron just that Jordan during his era was basketball ||2
Also, the teams were fewer and the rules looser .... men were men ... fouls were fouls ... and fuck John Starks. So punchable.|Cavaliers|1
I agree|Raptors|3
IMO if the Cavs score more points than the Warriors on Sunday they're gonna win the championship|Timberwolves|8
The motherfucking King. All the hate. The disrespect. The utter indifference that people have shown throughout the years as Lebron continued cementing himself as one of the greatest players this sport has ever seen. It's come down to the most important game of his career. A game 7 against the winningest team of all time. In their house. What will he do next? Drop 50? Stay tuned. |Knicks|9
Wow, People are destroying Ayesha Curry's twitter with stuff like this.\n\nhttps://pbs.twimg.com/media/ClIAGYEVYAQm1Et.jpg:orig|Warriors|7
What I saw today was Cleveland getting the early advantage, missed shots by the Warriors and then when they were getting close one man took over. LeBron played one of the best, if not his best game so far (2nd half for sure). The meltdown on the Warriors side doesn't amaze me because none of us here and most importantly on that team believed they would be in this situation after going 3-1. We have a game 7 folks, let's enjoy it. It can be one for the ages.||5
What if somebody hits a game winning shot..I'm so wxcited||1
Exactly. I'm hoping for a close game. It has all the ingredients to be a special game 7. ||1
haha, LeBron just said he's chill... he's in chill-mode... THERE'S ANOTHER LEVEL|Heat|6
...and...now... Is to go even......further beyond .. [AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH](https://youtu.be/8TGalu36BHA)|Cavaliers|1

[deleted]||3
Not getting calls?|Suns|2
It annoys me how much he keeps emphasizing how Steph is the MVP. Especially when Lebron has been showing everyone who the real MVP is.||5
This is what frustrated me the most. He kept reiterating that point that he's the MVP and he can act however he wants and do whatever he wants. If I was Silver I'd feel completely undermined |[SAS] Tim Duncan|2
I still think there's no way there's any chance Steph gets suspended, but if there was a way to increase be odds from 0% to 1%, it would be to completely undermine Adam Silver like what Kerr did. And then to laugh at the idea that Steph could get suspended. \n\nIf they don't win game 7, they're all going to look like jackasses.||1
I feel like Kerr had to stop himself short of saying "HAHAHA I DARE ADAM SILVER TO SUSPEND STEPH!"|[SAS] Tim Duncan|1
Stars get the benefit of the doubt from refs|[SAS] Tim Duncan|4
OH MY GOD FUCK STEVE KERR FOR THIS POST GAME INTERVIEW\n\nSeriously saying you're not allowed to call fouls on a guy just because he's the MVP. He used to be cool and level-headed, but that's because he hadn't felt the sting of failure before. Now that he's on the cusp of choking away a ring, he's showing his true colors. Fuck this fucking guy. \n\nI hope to GOD the Cavs win game 7, if ONLY for the epic shitstorm baby fucking tantrum he's going to throw. ||13
Lost my respect this series. Thought highly of him before.|Rockets|1
Let's not chalk this shit up to them choking. In our wins, Cleveland has straight worked them.|Cavaliers|1

There isn't a single Cleveland fan that is confident right now.\n\nWarriors could have half their team out for 7 and we still wouldn't be confident lol|Cavaliers|6
Pffft. Warriors exposed as paper champs. LeBron gonna score 100.||1
Not a Warriors fan, and firmly on The Cavs bandwagon, but listening to Klay Thompson's interview you can't help but respect the guy. Yes he left the game early, but he admitted the team got frustrated by some questionable calls and owned up to the fact that they got out played. Looking forward to game seven.||4
He showed a lot of class in that post-game, imo. Showed more maturity than his coach after a hard loss. |Thunder Bandwagon|3
True, very true. But I can't even blame Kerr for what he said. Just because it's smart, classic gamesmanship and he knows exactly what he's doing. Trying to put certain things in the officials heads for game seven, calling out the Cavs for holding Curry and Klay on their cuts, and constantly bringing up the fact that Steph is the MVP. Definitely gonna be fined quite a bit but to him, if he can sway the officials even a little bit it's worth it.||1

It's Cleveland. They could make their basket the entire one side of the court and they'd still lose. |Cavaliers|1
I'd love to see a video of all 6 fouls so people stop complaining. They were all legit except for #5. Curry gambles way too much and has a really low BBIQ on defense. |Cavaliers|5
They were reg season fouls.  Playoffs they are letting stuff go generally if it doesnt have any impact or affect.  Unless your name is curry apparently.  |Heat|0
Five was a steal though, it was a reach but he didnt get hardly any body and cleanly got the ball. |Spurs|1
To me it looked like he popped Irving in the face with his shoulder, still pretty soft though. I can't believe what they let Draymond get away with based purely on his reputation for being good at going straight up.|Spurs|1
I only remember the 5th of the top of my head and that was not legit, it was a fine steal.|Suns|1
It is so fun to be a fan of the losing team on this sub|Warriors|8

Dude it's insane, look at these comments lol. And people are saying that we are bad fans, but I don't see bvery many comments from warriors fans at all.|Warriors|1
That's because you lost. Come here after a winning GSW game and it is horrible. |Rockets|1
omg your username is godly. Yeah I agree, I really hope that if we win we don\'t act like this... \n\nBut then again I have posted things that are clearly "for" the cavs, giving them props, and I get downvoted into oblivion it\'s pretty depressing. I left a comment about how cool the cavs hype vid was earlier and it literally got downvoted and has the little cross sign on it from getting hit with down votes|Warriors|1
If you win it is going to be insane, if cavs win it's gonna be insane. The assholes are always the loudest so viewpoints get skewed. I mean I saw a Warriors fan saying he hoped Thompson would be put into a coma by a falling piece of skylight or some stupid shit like that. Someone weeks ago said they got joy from knowing that OKCs owner committed suicide. SPORTS AND ANONYMITY. |Rockets|1
Ok good point, but that sounds extreme. Then again many cavs fans have probably seen warriors fans say shit like that so what do I know? I wish it wasn\'t so reactionary though like I get it, someone hard the Warriors or wants to see them lose, so of course they are gonna look down on the Warriors after their team comes off winning. And they will remember all the negativity they saw and be like, "hey yeah cavs are awesome Lebron is the best fuck the dubs fuck green for that one time when he obliterated someone\'s testicles" \n\nAs a dubs fan I see it as a flopped kicking action but to anyone else it\'s a flagrant foul involving someone\'s poor testies. To each his own.|Warriors|1
Green has cemented himself as a dirty player regardless of the nut kicks. You don't suplex people without being called dirty. |Rockets|1
Keep yo head up, we've all been there. |Spurs|2
Fuck Kerr for his whole "he should get special treatment because he\'s MVP!!" attitude, he\'s a great coach and I respect him but that presser was just a whole lot of nonsense|Celtics|8

Kerr is such a bitch. MVP shouldn't get special treatment, which is what he's asking for. Furthermore its shameful that he's okay with the mouthpiece throw. I get that Steph was frustrated and got caught in the moment, but thats not something your coach should be encouraging. |Knicks|11

The last two fouls on Curry were bad calls|[GSW] Stephen Curry|74
His 2nd foul looked like a charge by Lebron imo.|[LAL] Kobe Bryant|1
Not to mention the blocking call on him in the first half when LeBron shoved him with his off hand.|Supersonics|1
He got away with some other fouls too. I think him fouling out was inevitable. ||1
There were many bad calls. |NBA|1
You spelled "bad plays" wrong.|[LAC] DeAndre Jordan|4
The steal on Irving was not a foul.|[BOS] Rajon Rondo|9
That call right there kinda killed whatever momentum they were building up|Bulls|2
yup||1
You can't make that play with five fouls. And he was reckless before that tbh|Nuggets|5
Even though he got all ball, it was still a foul. He was all over his body.|76ers|11
Nonsense. Curry can do whatever he wants! He just didn't foul and he allowed Lebron to dominate his team tonight!|Spurs|2
I thought he was fouling Irving before the actual steal. |Heat|7
Yeah I saw that too, there was the first reach that they were almost going to let go, but then he went for the second one. |Nuggets|2
He had to go cross body while holding him with his off hand to pick the ball, I know the last play was controversial, but you just can't do that, it's not only piss poor defense, it costs your team. That is a foul. You can state that it's the finals blah blah, but that only is useful if it supports your views, the fouls on Love and Smith were jokes as well, but they also didn't consistently gamble and grab all game.|Pacers|139
I'd agree with you, but the precedent for this series has been that you can hit, pull, tug, slap and elbow on the perimeter with no repercussions. You can't just change it up with 5 min left of game 6.|Celtics|-1
Yep. It was a reach, not the worst I've ever seen, but foul five was a reach to me. |Mavericks|6
This right here.   Curry tries to hold hands through almost every screen and almost never gets called |Cavaliers|20
Of course it was. Contact all over Irving's left arm helps Curry make that steal. It's a foul. |Cavaliers|27
I'd say three of them were actually fouls, 2 were complete bullshit, and one was close.|Bulls|8
To be fair, he got away with a lot of them tonight.|[CLE] Kyrie Irving|10
To be fair to the to be fair, the NBA seems to have decided hand checking Curry is ok, so if it's fair for all players Curry committed like 2 fouls tonight.|Mavericks|-6
Yeah the NBA obviously calls the game hard against curry. \n\n\nAre you fucking high? |Mavericks|9
So was this earlier in the game: https://streamable.com/ij5z. It was bad both ways. |East|8

poor klove. dude just can't get anything going this seasons. such a shame because he's top 30 player in the league in my opinion. when he came to Cleveland he seemed like he was top 15 |Magic|3
Same thing happened to Chris bosh. It just takes some adjustment dudes still that good|Knicks|1
chris bosh fit much better with the heat. especially in the 2nd season and beyond. kevin has disappeared. bosh never was close to playing 12 minutes a game because he was playing so shitty. they were still the big 3. i hate seeing this happen to love because nobody else has even got 30+ points and rebounds in a game that i have seen in the last 15 years.|Magic|1
Bosh fit better but he still had talks about being benched down the stretch in the first few years. He will slowly learnhis role|Knicks|1
he's just a bad match up against the warriors. if only they woulda kept wiggins and just not got love. at that time it was completely understandable why they did, but i bet if they could go back they would.|Magic|1

Klay walked into the locker room with 5 sec left in the game. Bitch move if you ask me. Kinda like how the Pistons did when Jordan's Bulls destroyed them in the playoffs back in the day ||3
This was entirely different from what the Pistons did. Pistons had just lost the series, Klay still has a game to play, he doesnt have to shake hands with the cavs just yet. |Vancouver Grizzlies|1
Klay loves to talk a big game, and for the most part, he can back up it. But him walking out of the game like that, that is such a bitch move. If you lose, lose, and walk back to the locker room with your team||1
Sure, but that won't affect my opinion about finals mvp|Suns|1
LeBron right? :)||1
I think you have to give it to him. He's been the best player in the series by far and he was also robbed last year.||3
Kerr stammering here a bit... little shaky||3
Where is the depth of the Warriors they are always going on about. They sure seem like a one dimensional team now. Too much focus on the 3 and when they miss they get punished on the other end. They should have been going for those 2 pointers at the beginning not at the end.||3

Elimination is not the only thing Lebron is fighting. \n\nGoing into this game, Lebron was 2 turnovers away from becoming the all-time leader in playoff turnovers. He only had 1 in game 6|Cavaliers|3
Klove getting 3 early fouls was the real saving grace for this cavs team in game 6. Hopefully Ty Lue picked up on this and plays Klove <15 minutes in game 7|Lakers|3
"Jason Phillips fell for that one" \nAdam Silver got rock hard when he heard those words. That\'s at least 75k there lol|[CLE] LeBron James|3

I know these haven't been the closest games but the on-court drama has made the series incredibly entertaining in my opinion. |Cavaliers|3
it's over, cavs win.||3
That's what many said in reverse back when the Warriors were up 3 - 1 in the series ...||3
"Kev" gonna get dealt this off season. ||3
Wow, both teams have 610 points through 6 games, amazing how close the series has become even with the blowouts|Bulls|3
SVP showed that. That has happened 3 other times in the history of all major American sports leagues. In the final game of each of those series, the road team ended up winning the championship, as well...\n\nSo naturally the Cavs will buck that trend because Cleveland, lmao|[SAC] Oscar Robertson|2
I just hope that game 7 isn't a blowout|Vancouver Grizzlies|3
tell me about it. the first half of game 5 was intense. I feel like it slipped away from the warriors when bogut went down. ||4
Just noticed Curry had 1 assist.|Cavaliers|3
damn I knew Barnes had a bad game but I didn't even realize he had 0 points lol|Cavaliers|3
Lebron entered the Zone.|Cavaliers|3
Series is dead even yet none of the games were close. Weird.||3
I just hope game 7 is close. If it's another 30 point blowout this will go down as the worst finals ever. |Heat|3
Depends who gets blown out. Bias aside, if Cleveland blows out the Warriors it will be considered one of the best comeback and ultimate collapse stories of all time. |Cavaliers|8

Warriors fans are some of the sorest losers I have ever seen and that's saying something. Especially for a team that has home court for game 7. You guys not only didn't lose the series yet, but still are the favorites.|Cavaliers|9
Fuck you.  We lost, of course some of us are sore.  You can't tell me that some percentage Cavs fans weren't sore after losing a game.  Fuck generalizations.   |Warriors|-6
How do people with bandwagon flair say this shit with a straight face?|[SAC] Oscar Robertson|1
Why does my flair matter?  Is what I said wrong?|Warriors|1
Some cavs fans are worse, trust me.  I have loved that team for my whole life and it has mostly sucked (I'm 27) but some people follow LBJ only.|Cavaliers|1
I think all fan bases are pretty much the same.  I don't believe in any one fan base being better or worse than any other.|Warriors|1
This exactly, it just depends on the person|Cavaliers|1
Hahaha, explain to your bandwagoner friends what adversity is.  Because they'll leave before they face it.|Bulls|3
Yeah, I feel so sorry for you and your double 3 peats lmao|Warriors|-4
They have just barley lost the last two years.  It sets a high water mark to live up to.  Just look at Alabama fans in college football.|Cavaliers|1

So, I think that 6th foul call on Curry was weak as fuck, but he can't be throwing mouth guards like that or going at it with the ref. Why jeopardize anything when you know all you have is one game left. People gave LeBron hella shit for Curry getting in his head in Game 4, but Curry let LeBron do exactly the same to him tonight, especially after that block. ||4
might of been a BS call but he legit threw a temper tantrum. totally uncalled for||2
Yeah man, just laugh and go to the locker room if you want. It's not worth it when you only have Game 7 left. ||1

This game wasn't rigged. Stats over fiction. Game 7 should be one for the ages|NBA|7
I used to be one of the fans who didnt want the Warriors to try sign Durant because it would mean losing Barnes and Ezeli.... I dont think that anymore|Warriors|6
The narrative based on which team wins or loses game 7 will be very interesting going forward.\n\nIf the Cavs win, talk about a memorable first chip for the land. Coming back from 3-1 against the team with the best regular season record. On top of that, doing it mostly with an ineffective Kevin Love who is supposed to be your third best player. If they lose, you really can't blame anyone barring LeBron and Kyrie freeze up.\n\n\nIf the Warriors win, they will have a chance to three peat and this team will be in the discussion for best team ever. If they lose, I imagine there will be a lot of criticism given towards various players. Some on Curry, some on Klay, some on Green, most definitely on Barnes. However, they will also be the laughing stock of trolls for having that unbelievable season, unanimous MVP and coming up with nothing in the end.||6
This wasn't bad offense by GS, this was the Cavs stepping up their defense to the next level.  This was great to watch.  Can't wait for game 7.|Cavaliers|6

I'm just impressed with how quick LeBron shut down the haters. Everyone was talking a whole lot of shit after game 4 and after 5, a lot less people did and now nobody is.\n\nEveryone is just admiring his greatness right now.||5
 Cavs shot 12% better from the field, had 10 more rebounds, 5 fewer shot attempts, 2 fewer turnovers, 5 fewer 3-pointers and only 3 more free throw attempts. Rigged my ass. Let me know what the refs have to do with any of those stats.||8
I almost started to like Draymond Green near the end of that game. They are down ~20, Klay and Steph are out, and Green is still running the ball down the court, and barking out play calls. His heart was in it until the end, unlike Klay Thompson.\n\nUnfortunately, he is a dirty unlikable asshole.|Cavaliers|9
The game was most likely over but fuck that 6th foul call on Curry. |Warriors|33
Curry committed at least 8 fouls in this game...  And melted down. Absolutely melted down whining and bitching and throwing temper tantrums.\n\nHonestly, I lost a lot of respect for Curry tonight.|Jazz|-2
Touchy foul... but its' 100% on Curry... refs had been quick with the whistle all game, he had 5 fouls, and it was a risky, over aggressive move on his part.  I assume the frustration just got to him.  It was a weak foul, but a stupid play on Curry's part regardless.|Pistons|1
\nThis is a grown mans league |Cavaliers|4
people are going to use this for their "fixed" arguments regardless.|Lakers|4
That was a retarded move in his part to reach in though||2
Remember earlier in the game when steph tried to get the charge on lebron and got a mysterious blocking foul that put him in foul trouble and Kerr had to take him out?|[DET] Ben Wallace|2
Mysterious? He was moving sideways and flopped. |Cavaliers|1
Would you flop if you got hit by a 6\'8" 250 lb statue?|[DET] Ben Wallace|1
Doesn't change the fact that he's moving, so it's obviously a block. |Cavaliers|1
Don't reach 1 on 4 and that wouldn't happen|Cavaliers|5
Dumb play by Steph to put himself in that position.\nSmart play by LeBron to fall into him and draw the foul.\n\nBad call by the ref to call a slight contact foul in that situation.|76ers|5
The refs really fouled him out for that Lebron James block.  They would have ejected him then and there if it were possible.|Cavaliers Bandwagon|4
It was iffy but he should've been smarter. He shouldn't be reaching 50 feet from the basket with 5 fouls|Rockets|11
Yeah that foul was questionable but it was too late for it to matter anyways. I've never seen Curry so aggravated. He's usually able to keep his composure even in the worst of times.||8
He only let it out because he had fouled out anyways so why would he keep his mouth shut||5
I mean it was a foul...he did hit arm. I think the ref should've waited to see if LeBron lost ball, and if he did then should've called foul.|Cavaliers|9

During the regular season there was. \n\nLebron looked out of it the past two years if you ask me. This year though especially this playoffs is literally some of the best basketball he has ever played. Its up there with '11-'13 LeBron ||2
Steve Kerr is actually kind of a moron, IMO.\n\nEDIT: yeah, you're talking out your ass now chief. Cry on.|[SAC] Oscar Robertson|6

I love comparing post-game comments.\n\nDurant and Westbrook: Take the bait and insult Curry's defense.\n\nKlay Thompson: Question LeBron's manhood.\n\nLeBron James: Steph Curry is a great player, and the Warriors were the best team in the NBA because of him.\n\nLeBron does not get nearly enough credit for being the most respectful grounded superstar in the NBA. He's come a long way from he and Wade mocking Nowitzki in the 2011 Finals. Hopefully these younger guys follow his lead.|Cavaliers|8

Sadly for the Cavs, Curry will be fired up and break the fuck out in game 7 due to the ejection. He was already breaking out in game 6 and I can't help but think he is going to be hitting his 3s from half court in game 7. Sucks cause they've been containing him as well as you possibly can.|[CLE] LeBron James|3
Or, he goes out in game 7 with the mindset that he's going to take over, but the Cavs keep him contained and he's so intent on being the hero that he continues forcing 35 footers. He goes 9-32 for 31 points and the Warriors lose by twenty. That's what happens when you start thinking you are bigger than the game. You get humbled.|[LAC] DeAndre Jordan|3

I wasn't sure who I thought was the best player in the world, I have no doubts now. Lebron all the way. It's frustrating to see basketball fans not being able to see what's in front of their eyes and not give him credit for his greatness. In 15 years we'll look back and wish we had enjoyed Lebron's career more in the moment.|[BOS] Larry Legend|3

Alright NBA we got a game 7 on Father's Day.  Let it be epic,  may the best team win.|Warriors|5
I've never been more fucking hype||3
If the Cavs manage to pull off an upset (coming back from 1-3?!) against this 73-9 Warriors team...sheesh. I won't even know what to say. The man is already great but this would validate it **that** much more. \n\nThat said, this Finals has been boring in terms of the margin of victories for both teams. It has never really been close but it's definitely been tense. When Cleveland is up 20, I'm sitting here waiting for the Warriors to hit 5 threes in a row. I would never be comfortable being up 20 against the Warriors and it's only half-time.\n\nAnyways, I've been pulling for the Cavs to win. Hopefully game 7 is a nail-biter.\n\n|Lakers|3
Tonight felt exciting even though the margin was double digits most of the game. ||1
Definitely.\n\nFew guys at the bar said it was over at half-time. I told them that it was only half-time and this was the god damn Warriors we were talking about. Sure enough, the Warriors cut it to down to 8-10 points. You can **never** be too sure with this Warriors team. They're too talented to roll over.|Lakers|1

Steph Curry could be an NFL QB. That mouthguard throw was right between the numbers. |Mavericks|2
LeBron James is just absurd. When he locks in, he really is unstoppable. Just absurd.|Celtics|2
Lebron is best player ever, curry and draymond are crap|Rockets|2
This game 7 is going to be epic. Love watching Lebron go into legend mode. If he pulls this off... I don't even know. Strong argument for being GOAT.     |Clippers|2
That's why LeBron is still the best player in the NBA. |Rockets|2
So is this the part where we treat game 7 like nothing but a formality despite everything we've seen this season and in these playoffs?|[LAC] Chris Paul|2
There were some bad calls, but that's not what lost the Warriors the game. They were outplayed on the road. They've shown that they can bounce back from everything, especially at home, so game 7 will be one for the ages.|Cavaliers|2
Imagine if LeBron walked off early like Klay just did. He'd get absolutely torched|Bucks|2
Another day, another huge statement game from LeBron. He makes them look easy but damn is he amazing to watch. ||2
Lebron has secured the finals mvp. All that's left is whether he wins the title. |Lakers|2
Warriors literally won 73 games just so they make their last stand at home.  |Spurs|2
The 96 Bulls never had to play a Game 7|[SAS] Tim Duncan|2
Hard to deny LeBron as one of the legit all time GOATs after these last couple of finals performances.|Raptors|2
At what point does fatigue play a factor in this series? Warriors had to win last night and didn't and now it's going to a game 7. |Cavaliers Bandwagon|2
cavs did a good god job rushing in and punching golden sate right in the mouth early. great game hope the cavs can pull this out|[OKC] Perry Jones III|2
I had chills watching this game Lebron is the greatest player I've seen and will ever see in my lifetime if you can't respect this man you are simply blinded by hate |NBA|2
FUCK DRAYMOND|Rockets|2
Stephen Curry will go off in game 7|Supersonics|2
Just want to say that JR Smith is a fantastic lob thrower. Such a soft touch|Nuggets|2
This would never have happened if Green played tonight, right Warriors fans? |Celtics|2

Come on Klay, you are better then that. ||2
Lebron is just now coming to terms with the fact that he has a dad dick. \n\nCh-ch-ch-ch-changes.|Bucks|2

Lebron is still the greatest player on the planet. |Lakers|2
Cleveland losing these finals would be funny, but the Warriors completing the reverse 3-1 choke would be even funnier.|Hawks|2

Steph Curry leaving the court early. Douchebag imo||2
He got ejected, wasn't a choice.||1
Warriors haven't lost 3 straight since November 23, 2013, but they look cooked. |Warriors|2

Point differential for the series is dead even. |[NOP] Anthony Davis|2

I agree.\n\nGotta play Barbosa.\n\nHe has his limits, but Barnes has gone off the reservation.|Warriors|1
Defensively Barnes has been average with a few bad mismatches especially against LeBron. But Barbosa can score and actually play offense and maybe guard JR or Shumpert. I wouldn't be surprised to see a Curry, Thompson, Barbosa, Green, and useless center lineup. |[ATL] Kent Bazemore|1

cleveland has to be careful. this isnt over yet, celebrate too much and you get hit in the face. i remember when the badgers beat kentucky to end their undefeated streak and we celebrated like we won the 'ship. then got beat by fuckin duke. celebrate for a little, but then back to work|Bucks|2

LeBron deserves MVP even if they lose. WHO the fuck deserves mvp on golden state now?|Thunder|2
Iggy looked so uncomfortable tonight. If he's hurt, that is trouble. With Bogut gone, GS has no one that can stop LeBron inside or out. That is a massive advantage, and now he has two games with confidence in his jumper. If the Cavs win, LeBron is pretty much going to ascended to a higher plane. ||2
This game was lost in the first quarter ||2

I wish that mouthpiece got lodged in Ken Mauer's Pat Riley hair... the league couldn't ignore that one could they?|Heat|2

Warriors didn't show up in the first and they were playing catch up the entire night. Given how close it got for 3 quarters, this would have been different. \n\nSteph, Klay, and Draymond all need to find that hunger again, or they end up choking the best record the NBA has ever seen, losing at home, and making Lebron an even bigger superstar |Bulls|2
Man, losing in the finals must always suck but THIS one is going to be the biggest fucking heartbreak for either team. After their amazing season and comeback against OKC, to blow a 3-1 lead and lose at home must be the most disapointing ever. \n\nOn the other hand, if the Cavs lose after their improved season and again comeback from 3-1, it would be yet again just close for Lebron. \n\nOh well, someone must lose... lets just hope the best game of the finals is game 7||2
Lebron has proven he shows up come elimination time. I had a feeling after game 4 he was not going down easy. I think the Warriors are underdogs at this point funny to say. Love how the tables have turned now, now they choked a 3-1 lead to game 7.|Thunder|1

Lebron James should win FMVP win or lose|Vancouver Grizzlies|2
That'd be absurd. Imagine him having to go up and get the award in the middle of Golden State celebrating a win (if they do). It'd be utterly ridiculous, i'd feel terrible for him if that happened. FMVP requires your team to win, a player on the losing team should never win it. ||2
Jerry West did it in 69.\n\n"West averaged 38 points during the series and had a triple double in Game 7 (42 points, 13 rebounds, 12 assists). West was named Finals MVP, making him the only Finals MVP from a losing team. This was the first year of the award."|Vancouver Grizzlies|1

Barnes will still get 120 million from Lakers. Here's a scene at the Lakers Offices right now:\n\nJim Buss: Hey Mitch, we can't kid ourselves, we're not getting Durant. Hell, we don't have a shot at Beal or DeRozan.\n\nKupchak: Well Jim, what do you want me to do? We luckily have Brandon Ingram coming in, so we have a nice youth foundation. We should save up for next year and hope our young core impresses.\n\nBuss: Nah. I can't wait a year. Let's throw money at Barnes. He's young and a core member of the Warriors.\n\nKupchak: Jim, have you seen him in the finals? He can't be our guy if he plays like that on the biggest stage.\n\nBuss: I Don't care!

These finals have reached the point where I have no idea what to expect in game seven. Both teams have been hot and cold. Hopefully it is a close one, but the one thing that has been consistent is the blow out :/|Spurs|2
Even though the Cavs were up by 20 during the first quarter, it felt like the Warriors had a legitimate chance to crawl back and steal it. Game 7 is going to be insane.|Cavaliers|2
I think this Game 7 comes down to who is healthier between Irving and Iguodola.  Both had injuries in that Game 6 that REALLY hampered their play down the stretch.  \n\nI also think Kevin Love is going to finally need to score around 15-20 points in a game for Cleveland.  I can't believe how useless he's been in this series.  This is a guy who averaged 26 and 12 just 2 years ago, and at age 27 should still be in his prime.  This series he's only average 7 and 4.5.  On the road in a Game 7, he's going to have to be much more impactful. |Grizzlies|2
Where can I see the actual mouthpiece hitting the fan?. \n\nAlso why does no one ever post  game interviews? |Lakers|2

And then the Bills a Super Bowl... right?!|Cavaliers|1
As a marlins fan, I have no other choice but to root for the cubs on the side. ||1
I've watched the fouls on Steph again (unfortunately I haven't found a videos with up close replays) and I have to say that you can give all fouls, except foul 5 on which the strip was clean, but maybe there was some illegal contact beforehand. With that being said, Curry certainly didn't get the benefit of the doubt on a few of them (4th and 6th, 5th if it was a foul at all). However, he has to play smarter than that, especially on #4 (don't try to win the rebound against Love) and and #6  (why would you reach in there, makes no sense).|[CLE] LeBron James|2
He kept reaching right in front of the ref.. The last one might not have been too bad.. although he did come across his body when he got the ball.. But the ref has been watching him reach.. That's bad dumb defense by steph in the situation he's in||1
this series showed us how classless gsw team is with their players, coach and even family members.. \n  \njust look at spurs, the way popovich and ginobili answered those questions after they are killed by refs..|Thunder|5
Kerr complaining about fouls again like a bitch|Cavaliers|6
Apparently it comes from the top down. Trickle-Down bitching.|Cavaliers|5
I loved watching the Warriors all season, but their sense of entitlement is ridiculous. It is hard not to root for the Cavs to beat them on their home court at this point.|Suns|5
All the good players went to the west just so they didn't have to play against LeBron James year in and year out.|Cavaliers|5
If Lebron pulls this off, it\'s likely the second greatest sports moment besides "The Miracle on Ice". And consider the events since 2003 with it all coming full circle. My goodness I can\'t fathom it honestly. If he wins Sunday, he\'s second on my list to MJ. |Knicks|4
I'm not sure about that.  I don't think it even breaks top 5 or 10 but in terms of current events, I think it ranks pretty closely behind the 07 Giants taking down the Patriots - and keep in mind, that Giants team didn't have a 'LeBron' either.|Bulls|6
Yeah maybe top 5? I mean yeah I was thinking of the 07 Giants/Pats and the Red Sox coming back from 3-0 down also as possible greater moments but to do this against a 73-9 team for his hometown? But I am probably getting ahead of myself. I mean MJ's last 48 mins with the Bulls is tough to beat too.....Or anything MJ did in retrospect.|Knicks|2
You know, you're right.  I've never been a big LBJ fan so maybe I'm letting that color my perspective on this - as well as the fact that I'm starting to think the Warriors are sort of a Nash/Suns 2.0 that managed to do what those Suns teams never did last year because of the injuries to the teams they faced.  That said, coming back from 3-1 down against the best single-season team in NBA history and winning a game 7 in their house where they're damn near unbeatable would easily be a top 5 model moment and maybe a top 10 all time moment.|Bulls|1
Yeah Boston 04 and miracle on ice definitely have it beat no question. I'd say this over giants pats just because of the history behind this year. That super bowl was more or less just about that one season. |Celtics|1
Paging /u/bootum\n\nI think you're already at work on the sequel to [Barnes-O-Mac](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgqmCpQkQkk): 0 for fucking 8 with 0 points.\n\nAlso, I'm eating the biggest fucking plate of crow regarding Tristan Thompson. Sorry for clowning on you beginning of the season after getting a huge ass contract. No hard feelings bruh.|[ATL] Pete Maravich|6
Aw LeBron your giving me feels talking to Craig Sager|Heat|5
GSW suffered the most from it, but let's not act like CLE didn't have players in foul trouble. The refs called it tight the ENTIRE game. Even in a previous game Van Gundy was talking about how the calls have to be consistent so players know what the tone is. They called it wire to wire very strictly. \n\n*EDIT* I would add that this might have even helped the Cavs because Love stayed on the bench. And it hurts me to say that.|Cavaliers|4

I got flamed and down votes at game 2 when I said Cavs win in 7.. there's still hope.||3
If I may, as a completely unbiased individual, NBA Finals game 7's (let's face it... game 7's of any sport) are about as good as they get.  I greatly anticipate the tip off.  It should be spectacular.\n||2

If Iguodala's back isn't right by game 7 the Cavs ought to win. Curry's not moving well, Bogut's out. The Cavs are the healthy team this time around.||3
It frustrates me to see how much of a cesspool this sub can become.\nWarriors win Game 1, Game 2, this sub be like, "LOLOLOL SWEEP."\nCavs win Game 5, potentially Game 6, this sub be like "Lol Curry shouldn\'t even be all-Star."\nAlso, the Warriors haters and Cavs haters--- Shit calls have happened for both teams. Stop acting like your team is the only one that\'s ever been right. Everyone claims the Warriors somehow get all the calls--- Let\'s face it, they did get some favorable calls against say Portland, and some against the Thunder, but the officiating this game has clearly been good for the Cavs.|Wizards|4

he should get suspended for that little bitch tantrum|Cavaliers|1

LeBron is not the best player of all time.\n\nHe is the most coddled by the NBA with insane star treatment. \n\nThe best player of all time is able to shoot if LeBron was not allowed to commit offensive foul after offensive foul while bullying his way to the basket he would be a good player at best.|Charlotte Hornets|-11
Someone didn't watch NBA basketball until 2005 it seems. You're complaining about LeBron getting to the basket on offense?  Go watch a Knick vs Pacers game from the early 90's then tell me LBJ fouls his way in the paint. |[NOP] Anthony Davis|3
False I have watched the NBA for years. No player gets away with the offensive fouls Lebron gets away with PERIOD. |Charlotte Hornets|-7
Lebron is the only star player (besides prime Shaq) I have ever seen that doesn't get the benefit of the doubt when he drives. He gets mugged 50% of the time when he goes to the hoop and only comes away with 10% of the calls.|Spurs|1
You're full of shit. |[NOP] Anthony Davis|2
quality retort nothing like name calling to prove your point /s \n\nSad that people cant have conversations without that childish crap another poster on ignore though. I have no interest in talking to people like that. |Charlotte Hornets|0
I said what I said because you're full of shit. LeBron doesn't commit blatant fouls when he's driving to the rim. If you think what he does is a foul, I suggest you go back and watch films of the older generations from the 70's through the early 2000's and see what real fouls and hard play are.|[NOP] Anthony Davis|1
People are dumb dude||1
And Curry isn't?  Quite frankly up until last night Curry had been treated like the Golden Child by the refs and league.  LeBron is coddled, but so are all the greats.||4
Curry is no where near treated the same as Lebron. Hell look at last night. Curry's second foul Lebron straight up runs him over throwing his shoulder/forearm into him. Curry is called for the foul|Charlotte Hornets|-1
Barring last night (which was an anomaly), Curry has been the NBAs Golden Boy for the last two years.||1
Curry showed on a screen, was moving, and reaching blocking James path. That is called on literally anyone.|Cavaliers|10
Exactly, that was a foul. IMO the only questionable one was the reach in to Kyre, and even that could have gone either way.||2
I wouldn't say it makes him the best player of all-time. Michael Jordan won six championships and averaged something like 30+ ppg throughout. But it definitely shows that he is the best player right now, and it would make it very hard to argue otherwise.||3
LeBron could win it for the next five years and id probably still keep moving the goal posts because I love Jordan   And space Jam. |Celtics|3
Space Jam is the best Basketball movie ever made and i have Jordan at n\xc2\xba 1 and Kobe at n\xc2\xba2 but Lebron is going to make Space Jam 2 and has a real chance to win a title for Cleveland and beat another record. |Cavaliers|0
Space Jam 2 is just another opportunity for me to move the goal posts.  I\'ll watch it and just mutter things under my breath. "Well it doesn\'t have Bill Murray..." |Celtics|1

Curry and Thompson showed their true colors tonight. Curry loses his cool and Thompson doesn't have the integrity to stay on the court til the end. If James does either of those things he gets crucified. Double standards are real. TT also proved he is worth every penny no matter what /r/NBA says. |Bucks|3

#CLEVELAND BROWNS. LEBRON LOVES THE COWBOYS. SEE YOU SUNDAY! |Suns|2
Man, I'm salty. We had the looks all night long, and we missed them all. Klay woke up for a few posessions in the third, but in the fuckin NBA Finals that's not gonna cut it. \n\nAnd Barnes...oh boy. When it doesn't matter, he's playing well, and when we need him to make wide open shots, not more, he disappears. If we lose this Finals, in my eyes, it's on him. \n\nWhat keeps my hopes up is, that without Bogut, with Iggy less than 50%, and with the exceptonally bad shooting, we still had a chanche to get back to the game.\n\nOh yeah, and fuck the refs. They were shit both ways, but damn, those last two fouls on Curry...Like I said: man, I'm salty|Warriors|2
Nothing beats NBA finals. There is nothing better than a game 7. Holy smokes. Please lord let it be  a close game. ||2

LOL at the warriors meltdown\n\nfun to see how they react to just one game without special treatment||2
Eyeball test, Cavs looked like they wanted it more and were the better team. But on the other side I see why fans are pissed about the refs. Why would the NBA ever let Scott foster ref a playoff game, yet alone a finals game, with the reputation he has and the fact that he is rated the worst official by managers and players in the NBA? I can see why people have doubts about the fairness and consistency of these games.||2
Damn lebron, you scary|Pacers|2

Going to be tough for the Warriors game 7 if Iguadala's injury is shown to be worse than thought. LeBron could just go King mode again.|[CHI] Derrick Rose|2
Sometimes those things get worse after you stop playing and everything tightens up, especially when you have to guard Lebron James.||1
Yeah it would be a match-up nightmare if Draymond has to guard LeBron because Tristian Thompson can grab all the boards.|[CHI] Derrick Rose|1
honest question. Does curry have a chance to get suspended for game 7? Prob not but wouldn't it be great?|Pistons|2
It would have to be at the discretion of the commissioner I believe. So no, that'd be ridiculous. If he punched or something he'd almost definitely be out. |Charlotte Hornets|1

And I'm another evil angry Philly fan/native rooting for LeBron the whole series...||1
Golden state shot 40% and Cleveland shot 52%. Golden state was flailing around all game looking for fouls when the cavs were attacking.  Each shot a similar amount of free throws as well.  Anybody bitching about the refs is either blind or completely unfamiliar with how the game works.  The refs didn't help Lebron score 18 straight ||4

I think that regardless of what happens with the rest of his career, if Cleveland wins this series there will be honest debate between him or MJ as the GOAT. The public consensus will be split 50-50.|Pistons|3
Mj will always be goat\n\n\nHe has 6|Cavaliers|-1
If that's the stat you want to use, Bill Russell is the greatest ever||4
Honestly even if curry didn't foul out I didn't see the warriors coming back anyway tonight. |Lakers|4
This series has just been cringe worthy for Kevin Love. I used to think that guy was the man and I honestly felt like his absence was a big part of the Cavs' decline in the finals last year. Now, every time he's on the floor I can't help but feel like he's doing more harm than good. He could recover career wise and perception wise by being the best player on a smaller team in the future, but his stock as a valuable player for a contending team has really hit rock bottom. Dude came up small at the worst time ever, not in defeat but in success.||1
Love sits at the corner 3 all game. That's not his game. You sound dumb af||-1
No doubt he has been awful by his standards, but keep in mind he had a concussion a few days ago. In the NFL, protocol keeps players out for at least a week usually. He is going right back into it and playing barely any minutes for a reason||2
Do y'all remember when K-love finished 6th in MVP voting in 2012? I don't either.|Supersonics|2
He didn't stand in the corner back then. He got to operate from the corner of the key. That's LeBron's spot too so hes relegated to stand and watch. ||1
I just want Cleveland to have one championship they everyone at least deserves one. ||2

I think LBJ has saved his legacy by extending this to 7 games with his game 5 and 6 performances.\n\nIf he manages to win 3 straight against the historically great Warriors, AT ORACLE, to win a championship for Cleveland, he'll be thrust into GOAT consideration. Or at least cements himself as #2 behind Jordan.|76ers|1
The person a bunch of people on this sub called soft less than a week ago is now averaging\n\n30.2 Points, 11.3 Rebounds, 8.5 Assists, 2.7 Steals, and 2.1 Blocks per game on 51.4% shooting in these finals. \n\nSince everyone started calling him soft, he's averaged 41/12/9. \n\nHe's put together historic performances in back to back finals. The fact that people either don't realize this or don't care is somewhat depressing.|76ers|1

Ok rigged or not, thank you NBA for giving me a Game 7. This series was almost too boring for me until that Dray suspension. Now I get to see an epic LBJ finals performance, probably his best ever, and a Game 7 at Oracle Arena with that raucous crowd and a fired-up Steph. |[DAL] Raef LaFrentz|1

For all the hype that Iggy is a Lebron stopper, I don't think he does anything to stop him. He defends as well as he can but there is no stopping Lebron.\n\nThe Warriors ga e the game up in the first quarter. No coming back from that.\n\nThe Cavs figured out a way to get Lebron on Curry and he is backing down on Curry comfortably. I don't know the Warriors can counter that.\n\nCurry is playing like shit. He is making dumb plays and getting dumb fouls.\n\nKlay had a off night offensively.\n||1

The overall score of this series is exactly tied at 610, yet the average margin of victory is 20 points per game. I really hope game 7 is the first close one. |[BOS] Larry Bird|1

After Lebron finished talking to Sager, it was awesome seeing him connect with all of those people on his way to the tunnel. Cleveland is his home and nights like these are exactly why he chose to come back. Here's there to play in front of, and FOR, his own people. Hope he brings it home on Sunday. ||1

Barnes needs to come off the bench. Theres no reason for him to be touching the ball on offense anymore. He killed them in the first quarter.|Mavericks|1
well with iggy hurt as well i dont see it going well for the dubs, he wasnt jumping for rebounds or fighting through screens in the 2nd half||1
Who do you start instead?||1
Anyone or just dont have him screw the team over in the first 6-10 minutes.|Mavericks|1
He'll rebound game 7. If Iggy can't go he'll have to for them to win ||1
anyone got a link to watch the game now that I'm finally home??|[TOR] Kyle Lowry|1

I have completed my advanced analytics scoresheets and watched plenty of tape from this series and concluded i don't have a fucking idea who is winning this series. |Celtics|1
Jesus; you coulda put me on the floor for 16:26 and i woulda gave you a better stat line than Harrison barnes|Warriors|1
I have to wonder why they kept playing Iggy so much when they have such a deep bench and their really deep guys were playing well. Iggy is regularly an absolute monster, I'm the first guy to point that out, but he clearly wasn't himself last night. |76ers|1
He's basically the only one they feel comfortable having guard Lebron.  \n\nYou're right though.  He definitely wasn't himself last night, and he couldn't stop Lebron either.  |Grizzlies|1
chances that Iggy doesn't play in game 7?|Clippers|1

I must say that I've loved these box scores ever since the Hornets put them in their game threads. I'm happy to see that this is the new standard for post-game threads in the playoffs.|Knicks|1

None of his fouls were outrageous. And if draymon got his due when he should have, the Warriors wouldn't even be playing right now.\n\nHold the salt.||9
Oh yeah, you salty as fuck.  Curry did all that shit to himself and you're showing your ignorance for saying Draymond shouldn't have been suspended because he wasn't for what he did to Adams.  *That played a part in his suspension*.  When will you guys understand that?\n\nSo no, that's not the only word I know you salty bastard.|Cavaliers|13
Nah you're just filled with sodium |76ers|26
nothing better than salty warriors fans||-1
Steph curry needs to be suspended for game 7. Can't violently assault a fan like he did.||2
I agree he needs to not lose his cool or throw shit but let\'s not get carried away here. He threw a soft rubberized mouthpiece that weighs a couple ounces. He didn\'t "violently assault" anyone.||2
Haslam got suspended for the same reason, granted he threw it at a ref. Not saying he will get suspended or anything but its happened before|Lakers|1
Honestly I haven't seen the incident you're referring to. I'll have to look it up. But to summarize what I said in another thread, I think the fact that it was a fan, along with the fact that Curry made a good natured gesture of apology to the fans he hit and didn't leave the court still flipping out will go a long way in the eye's of the league. I would definitely expect a fine but no suspension.\n\nEDIT: I just watched the Haslem clip and to me that looks a lot worse than what Curry did. Haslem took it out and was looking at the ref and really seemed to try and throw it at the ref. To me Curry's incident seemed like he just threw it in anger but didn't intend to hit anyone.||1

5/6 of Curry's fouls were clear, only one I'd say wasn't was the steal against Kyrie ( I admit that was a huge call ), but they gave a foul to I thing Livingston? that should've been against him earlier anyways.|Cavaliers|1
man that cavs fan fucked up. shoulda taken a swing and made a guaranteed suspension for curry. take one for the city brooo |Supersonics|1

Kick your legs out at that sixth foul, motherfucker. |Cavaliers|1
Love and Curry both got fucked on foul calls|Cavaliers|1
And here\'s where the idea of the supposed "offense of the future" that Golden State is using falls completely to pieces -- in a big playoff game the number of guys you want shooting 3s contracts down to the two superstars and maybe one other guy if the third guy is hitting that shot.  It is surprising to me this idea of spreading the 3 point shots around to everyone was ever taken seriously by analytics people.\n\nAs an analogy, the analytics people in baseball endlessly roast managers for saving their closers possibly not even pitching them while inferior pitchers are consuming most of the minutes.  Why this same principle isn\'t extended to basketball by analytics people completely baffles me.||1

Officiating can't make T Thompson hit 15 points and 16 rebounds. \n\nSteph Curry getting fouled out favors GSW tbh.

One game from the prophecy being fulfilled. Win it for the Land. ||1
Game 7 prediction:\nCavs have a two point lead, then Steph curry drills one from half court.||1
If he can hit a fan with his mouth guard from half court I'll be very impressed.|Timberwolves|3
This win will be all for naught if the Cavs don't finish them off on Sunday.. Please Cavs, finish them off on Sunday.|Spurs|1
Even **Golden State** doesn\'t have a reliable third shooter who can hit a 3 point shot when they have to have it in an NBA Finals.  How can an offense based on everyone shooting 3s possibly be the "offense of the future?"||1
So, why was Curry sent out? I get the five fouls thing, but was that last call even deserving of a foul? I don't watch basketball that much, but it's hard to see that he did anything wrong besides reaching for the ball|Magic|2
There was likely contact making it a reach in foul. He was given a technical for throwing his mouthpiece and arguing with refs so they threw him out||1
i think because he threw the mouthpiece at the fan he got ejected but not 100%|Cavaliers|1
It was a blocking foul, he jumped in front of James not allowing him to continue forward progress, they didn't call the reaches.|Pacers|2
That last foul was a bit questionable and definitely not that clear cut. Nonetheless, the foul was called, and that was his 6th foul, meaning he was fouled out (can't play anymore because he fouled too much. Has to sit on the bench for the rest of the game). But after the foul, Curry got frustrated and threw his mouthpiece and yelled at the ref, which to him being ejected (aka kicked out).||2
Lebron's entire legacy is on the line sunday and the warriors as well cannot fail|Minneapolis Lakers|2
His *entire* legacy?\n\nI mean yeah a giant chunk of it, but he still has a good list of accomplishments.|[SAC] Oscar Robertson|3
Lets be honest. In 20 years when it comes out that the nba is rigged, this will be one of the games used as evidence|[LAL] D'Angelo Russell|-72
Haha exactly. Miraculously out of 3 years steph has managed to foul out when he hasn't even hit 5 fouls before. Also coincidentally in game 6 pushing the series further to game 7. If they're gonna call fouls they need stop calling some bull tick tack fouls they are and stop letting both teams players get into dangerous situations without a whistle.||-7
Just stop |Celtics|4
 True but I hope that day never comes. |Thunder|-1
Yeah everyone knows you're not allowed to turn Lebron up to 11, it isn't fair to the other teams.|[MEM] Tony Allen|1
Eh, those later fouls probably shouldn't have been called on steph, and he should've stayed in the game. Lebron had a monstrous performance and there is no denying that. Warriors were outplayed. Even to play devils advocate, I felt that other games had more officiating bias than this one in the finals.|76ers|1
Flair up so we can taste that salt.|Bulls|4
Did they build a lebron android who uses a magnetized ball that is drawn into the hoop or something?||2
How so? Did the NBA rig the rims to make the Warriors shoot 40% and the Cavs shoot 52%? Or did they pay off Barnes and Livingston to combine for 1-14 shooting?|76ers|2
Let's be honest, you're salty. ||2
No|Cavaliers|2
Naw|Lakers|2
I mean the fouls were even 24-24 but suuuuure, go ahead and put on that tin foil hat|[CLE] LeBron James|4
When I saw KLove and Shumpert with three questionable foul calls I thought the refs were trying to let GS back in it.\n\nI still think GS had more help from the officials than Cleveland.|West|4
No it wont. Either you're a kid or you don't watch basketball|Spurs|6
Let's be honest. There were shit calls both way, especially the ones on Love and Shumpert in the first half. Don't act like it was one sided. |Cavaliers|11
Let's be honest, Lebron is a God.|Timberwolves|9
Let's just be honest, let's just be real|Supersonics|0
Expand on that? Both teams had the same amount of fouls calls against them (25 a piece) with the exception of Curry's Technical. \n|Jazz|3
The game where the cavs were up by 15-20 for most of the game, and the closest the warriors got in the 2nd was 7?|NBA|3
You tell em Ayesha!!|Grizzlies|8
Lol the starting 5s for both teams had the same number of fouls called on them.|[LAC] Chris Paul|5
Cavs had like three key players with three fouls on them at the start of the second? Kids claiming refs are fixing the game when the only they sending Cavs to the bench.|West|10
[deleted]||-5
The Warriors will still win the series. The NBA simply wanted to take the series to 7 games to profit more. I doubt the NBA wants the Cavs to win it all though, they might even prefer if the Warriors did, might be more profitable in the future. The league did fuck the Warriors out of a 5 game series win though.|Raptors Bandwagon|-2

Most Warriors fans haven't been Warriors fans for long. It's cool.|Cavaliers|9
There was no fuckery with Green's suspension. The only fuckery was Green being a dumbass. GS fans made fun of Cavs fans last year for complaining about losing players, GS has no right to do the same.|[MIA] Chris Bosh|8
[deleted]||1
True, he should have been suspended earlier, but still should have gotten a flagrant for this. So he technically should have been suspended twice. So that doesn't really work.|[MIA] Chris Bosh|3
Green's suspension happened because he kept committing flagrant fouls.  The league did not arrange for Bogut's injury.\n\nIt's actually much easier for the officials to fix the game in other sports, where they make fewer calls and there's far less scoring.  But because there are so many calls in basketball people seem to think the officials have more control.  Just the opposite is true.|Bulls|5

You really want to ruin a game 7 of the finals over this? Really? DIAF.||0
Wait... Hear him out.|Cavaliers|2
Ron Artest jumped into the stands and punched a man. Also nobody would trust or watch the NBA if Curry got suspended for game 7. He also apologized to the fan right after and saw what he did. |[ATL] Kent Bazemore|3

You can sit here and complain about the refs all you want Warriors fans, but the Cavs came out strong, led the entire game, and the Warriors never got back within 7.\n\nAll of those foul calls on Curry were good calls, and the cavs had some bullshit called against them too.  You lost, move on to game 7.|Kings|0
Stfu u blind..you cant even touch a cleveland player cause fts..lmao.refs killed all the momentum when warriors was making a run..kyrie when them 4 straight fts|Warriors|0
You honestly need to take off the blue covered glasses.|Kings|-1
Btw, here's the play, https://streamable.com/q1wy\n\nSee Curry hit Lebron's elbow when he went to the steal?  That's a standard reach in foul.|Kings|1
I agree that the Cavs played better and probably would've won regardless of Steph being in. But not all the calls on Steph were good. Definitely not that last one. |Suns|2
That was just dumb by Curry.  Going for the steal in the back court and making contact when he as 5 fouls.|Kings|0
Harrison Barnes is fuckin trash. GS better let him walk and let another team overpay for him. Cleveland is just leaving him open and letting him shoot at this point. He's just awful.|Raptors|0

No one gonna talk about how the officiating was garbage? |Wizards|-2
LeBron was a real bitch tonight. He was a sore loser in Game Four throwing a fit all around the court and getting in his scuffle with Draymond. Then tonight he was constantly in Curry's face after the play, goading Dubs players. Just a complete 180. It's like he couldn't be graceful in victory or defeat and the same shit he would have complained about when they were losing he's out there doing while they're up. Just seemed real lame to me. ||-13
If that's lame, you've gotta believe the things Draymond said about LeBron were even more lame, right?||3
If all Draymond did was call him a bitch then no I think that's what happens on the court and Draymond isn't out there crying about double standards. \n\n\nI think Draymond's nut shots on Steve Adams were lame and uncalled for though. ||-2
Your issue seems to be about hypocrisy. But if you can't tolerate hypocrites, pro sports just aren't for you. \n\nEvery single player in the NBA is a hypocrite. Did you see Steph and Draymond yell at Varejao every time he put on his dead guy impression? Of course not, because that oversight in the part of the refs helped Golden State. Likewise, LeBron wouldn't be angry if Varejao was doing the same thing FOR the Cavs. Dray is as invested in these double standards as anyone else in the league.||2
Oh shut up you people look for everything. This is so stupid lebron can do no right. Or are you also mad at steph for going out in a totally disgraceful way? |Knicks|7
I never said Steph wasn't at fault on the way out. I never said he did no wrong, don't put words in my mouth. And again I wouldn't have said anything about LeBron's intensity I get what it's like in the heat of the moment but he went out on his tirade about being a mad after Game Four trying to claim Draymond was going over the line when he clearly instigated it. But then he comes out here tonight and he's in everyone's face acting a fool because they're winning. It's an insane 180. He's a sore winner and a sore loser. ||-3
I'm sorry but shit was talked constantly to him. He's a bitch. He finally responds and then it's wow lebron is so ungraceful. It's just dumb how over criticized one player has become.|Knicks|4
But everyone said he was a bitch because he was overly sensitive to on court trash talk. Then he doesn't even stick to his guns and be respectful on the court. Instead he comes out and acts like a goon on the court in Game 6. It screams hypocrisy. The only difference was they were losing game four and winning game six. That makes him sound like a child to me. He couldn't be respectful in defeat or in victory. Again I wouldn't care if he didn't make a colossal deal out of game four, but he did. So now it's do as I say not as I do for LeBron? No one is allowed to shit talk him but he can get in people's face? \n\n\nHe can't go out and talk about sportsmanship and being a gentleman on the court because someone called him a bitch and instead he runs up and down the floor taunting in a game they're winning. Looks classless. ||2
dude all he said was get that shit out of here after blocking curry thats not that bad. I get it if you are this big of a lebron hater.|Knicks|3
Cool story bro.|[MIA] Dwyane Wade|6
Sounds salty to me|Cavaliers|5
Not salty, why would I be salty about losing to the best player to ever play the game? Cavs won, they were far better tonight and they deserved the victory. No salt. I was just rubbed the wrong way by how childish LeBron acted. He's a sore winner and a sore loser and I think that's a shame. It's not cool and it's not in the spirit of competition. I was hoping for more integrity out of a Man. A Father. With Three Kids. ||-5
He was really humble in his post game interview. I wouldn't judge him for all the adrenaline happening during the game.||5
Totally called that the NBA wanted a long series the minute they suspended Draymond. I think Silver wants LeBron to win this series. Silver is the real FMVP if Cavs win|NBA|-4
From a guy who watches a lot of hockey and very little basketball, is basketball always this rigged in terms of reffing?|Raptors|-5
I have a crazy story about steph curry. This was his rookie year and they finished a game in sactown. My family owns a liquor store and andris biedrins and steph curry show up and buy 300$ worth of alcohol.

Loved Stephs last foul. LeTravel lowers his shoulder into him, then elbows him, and apparently that's a foul on Curry. Amazing officiating this year all throughout the playoffs||-3
I honestly can't believe its taken me this long to realise I'm watching the WWE and not competitive sport. This is a sad day for a long time NBA lover. I'm not even sure I want to watch game 7.|Supersonics|-31
That was disgusting |[MIA] Mario Chalmers|-1
Honestly what issue do you have with that game? I don't think there's a universe where the Warriors could possibly win? Kevin Love got screwed on some calls just like Curry did.||1
Early fouls on players. Touch fouls to disrupt flow and and continuity on a team. Literally 3 of the fouls on Steph were not fouls. This is the MVP of the league in the Finals. Do you think that they would have been blown on him if GSW was down 3-2 in game 6? Maybe I am still jaded by Donaghy but I certainly do not.|Supersonics|1
You're right... There were phantom calls on RJ, Lebron, two on Love, and another on Shump. Frustrating to watch.|Cavaliers|1
Oh stop all that fucking whining. Bad calls happen and Curry put himself in a bad position to get called for that foul. It's his fault|Spurs|3
Why is it his fault? 3 of his 6 fouls were not fouls, much less in a Finals game, much less on the MVP.|Supersonics|-5
We'd all prefer you didn't watch either.|Bobcats|2
Thanks for the kind words. Good luck with your soon to be President Donald Trump. The rest of the world is laughing|Supersonics|1
Thanks we're looking forward to him too!|Bobcats|1
Crying will win the game, just gotta keep at it||2
Yeah Lebron has proved that|Supersonics|1
I don't think that it was fixed or anything. It was just an awful game from the officials. They made so many bad calls, had no consistency, let their egos get in the way and were just completely awful all around. |Supersonics|2
It started with the Draymond decision. Even JVG and Zach Lowe said it was an attempt to extend the series, which would work in to today and and the clean ball strips from Curry that were called fouls, Jefferson taking out his legs etc. \n\nImagine how much $$$ the NBA leaves on the table from a 5 game series compared to a 7 game series.|Supersonics|1

I feel like this game might have went a different way had Curry not gotten that second bullshit foul early in the first and had to sit that quarter out letting the Cavs run away with it.  The Warriors just couldn't recover from that, anytime the Dubs put together a run or got to close there was some bullshit foul call on them to shut it down, some of the most rigged looking shit ever.  Especially since Curry had never even had 5 fouls the entire season let alone be in first half foul trouble and he hasn't fouled out in 3 fucking years.  Fucking horseshit.|Bulls|-6
Golden state fans complaining about refs. That's rich lmao...|Thunder|5

Refs are shit, we don't need to be reminded every game|[MIA] Hassan Whiteside|1
If we are reminded so much, why don't we have good honest discussions about it?||1
Because it's a known fact that the refs make bad calls and no amount of discussion will change that as it's been happening for decades now and nothing's happened. Refs have even admitted to rigging games for bets but   the NBA moves on regardless. Ik it sucks especially if it's your team on the bad end of it, but at this point its just part of the game|[MIA] Hassan Whiteside|1
It sucks to have that attitude but your so right...||1
Neutral fan, and in fact I normally don't watch NBA games other than my team...but it was pretty unwatchable for me.  Seemed that the Refs let Cleveland play physical when normally these would be fouls.  Cleveland is by far the more physical team so it benefits them sooo much.  Has it been this way every game?|[BOS] Larry Bird|-6
Every game in every playoff series.|Heat|1
No matter what team you root for, tonight game pretty much sums up why so many people are embarrassed to be a fan of the NBA and officiating. \n\nYou can\'t tell me that if Bron had 5 fouls that he would have got called for that weak 6th? If you are gonna eject a superstar, you better make that foul a real foul \n\nAlso, so much for Lebron "being a father with kids" with the way he acted on the floor. Just tired of the fakeness. Be who you are. Don\'t play it both ways ||-7

Better scores around Bron lets him do work even more. \n\nAlso also, I honestly feel like teams know how to play the Warriors now. Two game 7s in a row. They're still an amazing team and have as good of a chance as anyone to win a title, but IDK that they're a dynasty type of team anymore that can three-peat and maybe more. |Pelicans|0
>know how to play the Warriors now\n\nYeah, and it only took the rest of the league 82 games and two rounds of playoffs to figure it out. Even then Durant and Westbrook couldn't completely figure it out.|Hornets|1
You don't have to win the series to know how to play a team. They're still an amazing team that went 73-9 for a reason. Just knowing how to play them isn't enough to actually beat them. |Pelicans|1

My prediction for game 6 was\n\n> With few defensive changes, ~~LeBron and~~ Kyrie will cool down bit from game 5 but will open up for the others to finally show up, ~~Frye~~ Dahntay Jones will lead the bench with ~~5 threes and finish with 17~~ 5 Points.\n\n> Cavs will lead big early, Golden State will make few runs and cut as low as ~~5~~ 7 points at one point but game will get out of hand after that and will be set up to epic game 7 come Sunday.\n\n|NBA|0

Anyone else find this game really suspicious with the refing? Like i really like lebron hes an awesome guy and player,but his awesome preformances are tainted by the refing in this series in my opinion. It's not as obvious as the 2002 WCF but its getting up there.||-2
Are you crazy there was two horrible plays against the cave. Loves third foul? This is so stupid there was a lot of really close calls that guess what you get them at home. Stop being a whining bunch of birches you just witnessed an unbelievable game and came out like that?|Knicks|1
It was an unbeliveable game, but to me it was tainted by how everytime the warriors tried to make a foul, there was a stupid foul stoping their momentum. Thats just general as a fan watching the game. It was amazing to see Lebron preform but it seemed tainted to me.||1
What are you talking about? Yes, there were a bunch of calls that I don't agree with, but on both sides|[CLE] LeBron James|2
I can see where your coming from, but for me I saw stupid fouls when the Warriors tried to make a run.||-1
Same happened in the 2nd quarter, only against Cleveland. Actually put a few players in foul trouble (for example Love, who looked like he could've scored a bit more)|[CLE] LeBron James|3
If you ask me, a run in the 2nd quarter is FAR less important than a run in the 4rth quarter. (not putting down the fact that that happened).||1
The run in the 2nd quarter is what got the game close and gave the Warriors momentum|Raptors|1
Yeah but it the Cavs still pulled away, and they had a decent lead coming into the 4rth.  But midway down the stretch you could see momentum shifting to the warriors, until that crap reach in foul on kyrie.||2
lucky bastards the refs were told to get it into game 7 for them. If curry continued to play this would have been much closer.||0

OK lets be honest:\n\nI'm not the type of person that thinks the NBA is rigged, nor do I think the NBA is influencing this series is any way. Also, as much as I dislike him as a person and as a competitor, Lebron just played one of the greatest games I've ever seen. \n\nBut Steph got screwed tonight. In general the refs were pretty ass. I mean, that 6th foul was called simply because it was a type of play that doesn't happen often and the refs probably had it in their mind when Steph went for the steal that it was a foul.\n\nPlus, that phantom call on Klay. WTF? A offensive foul on the shooter? And contact wasn't even made! \n\nThat being said, the Cavs played much, much, much, MUCH better than the dubs tonight and definitely deserved the win.\n\nAll is know is, Game 7 is going to be fucking nuts.\n|Suns|-4
It's not like they didn't have bad calls against the Cavs though. That Love charge call was fucking ridiculous. |[HOU] Hakeem Olajuwon|1
I realize that. Just statin that I feel like some of the calls against Steph were wrong. Hence me saying, "in general" the refs were pretty ass.|Suns|1
>NBA Forces a game 7  \n  \nFTFY|Heat|-10
Game was over from the start when Steph got trucked and called for a blocking foul, warriors were in foul trouble from the very start|Bucks|-2
Curry's $25000 fine going straight to the referees who helped the NBA get their game 7|[ATL] Kent Bazemore|-2
This is all just the setup for Cleveland's most heartbreaking loss to date.\n\n**SHOWER ME IN YOUR DOWNVOTES**|Warriors|-2
Nah, they're gonna be heavy underdogs ||0

So, game 7 or Game of Thrones?\n\nI'm so conflicted.|Bulls|-2
Both scripted tv. Dvr one and watch later|Trail Blazers|1

I dunno I think I'd rather watch the thing that won't be plastered in its entirety across the entire internet|Cavaliers|1
Wtf?  Game of thrones isn't live.  Obviously watch the game? ||2
that was rigged af, so many terrible calls and no calls against the warriors.|Lakers|-2
Yeah that love third call was such a good call. You people are insane. Curry kept chasing kn that final call you don't do that with 5 fouls. They lost their cool simple as that |Knicks|1
That was literally one call against you guys.   And just because he had five fouls doesn't mean shit.   That wasn't a foul.   |Lakers|1
There was plenty both ways. And the ones that are apparently making it rigged were like 3 calls that were sooooo close it's insane to call rigged. And so rigged he had one of the greatest lines ever|Knicks|1
Let's just put an asterisk next to this game. ||-2
rigged games so sad|Bulls|-2

Games 1-5 Get away with murder. \nGame 6 - DID YOU JUST BREATH ON HIM. Shooting Foul.\n\nI\'m willing to bet anything that Curry goes off for Game 7. The fire at the end, the frustration, that\'s what gets Curry going. I think this game was a bit... "Influenced" but I\'m excited that game 7 is happening! Should be great. |[CHA] Bobby Phills|-2
Fucking pussy cav fans courtside trying to tell on curry for throwing his mouth guard and then shake his hand when he comes over. Lol way to backtrack |Mavericks|-7

https://streamable.com/q1wy that last foul was terrible lol, really was a flop and the refs let this be a 6th foul in a nba finals game... |Minneapolis Lakers|-9
He was in his path. Sure Lebron sold it a little, but it wasn't a *flop*. If they called every foul on Steph he wouldn't have been in the game at that point, be grateful for the 30 points he contributed. The rest of the team needed to step up. |Charlotte Hornets|2
I'm not a warriors fan man, lebron flopped and the refs gave curry his sixth foul in a play like this. I'm happy to see a game seven  |Minneapolis Lakers|0
You do not reach in with 5 fouls. Not only did he reach in but he undercut Lebron with his whole body.|Cavaliers|5
Warriors are still going to win game seven. |Warriors|-10
Naw, The Chosen One is finally fulfilling the Prophecy made in 2003.||3
And game 5, and 6.|Cavaliers|4
I thought this series was already over though? Hmm that's weird. |Supersonics|3
It is already over.  Game seven is going to be a blow out.  Warriors aren't losing three in a row and two in a row at home. \n\nIt just won't happen. |Warriors|-4
Refs were garbage. We might as well use this guy...\n\nhttp://funnymeme.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Yes-This-Is-Dog.jpg\n\nEdit: I was just joking guys. I'm not even a fan of either team =(||-9
Nba is no longer a sport its a business. Nba already putting up tix for game 7 with gsw vs cle way before the warriors miraculously comes back from a 3-1 deficit against okc. Now same is happening for cavs to create hype. And Curry gets ejected after they start scoring nonstop for 4 minutes and closing it up to 9pts with 5mins left so they could force a game 7. Still warriors will win, they will give national business association more money. Lebrons talent fee is too high.||-17
You can buy tickets for teams playoff games well before the playoffs in most sports...|NBA|3

I feel like it's weird that Craig Seager is totally humorless||-3
Really? Dude is going through cancer treatments I think. I'm sure be doesn't feel the greatest but he's still working his ass off. ||1
I just mean it's weird that whenever someone jokes around with him he almost gets offended. It's been the case since before he had cancer||1
I guess I've never noticed. Ok sure he's just trying to be a professional. ||1
So like here\'s what I\'m talking about. If you\'re going to wear suits like that you\'d expect someone to have a sense of humor about it. But when Garnett makes a crack he acts like he\'s wearing normal clothes and Garnett is totally out of line.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/ltpqPd3t5V0\n\nSimilarly tonight LeBron joked about him never having covered a finals game and Seager freezes up and says "thanks for entertaining me" as a closing line. It just seems like he takes himself way too seriously if he\'s going to wear those ridic suits||1
I think that's just a part of his shtick but maybe not. Doesn't want to break character and that's why guys do what KG did to try to get him to crack up.||1
He is dying from Cancer. |Suns|7
What a load of horse shit. I'll never get over that Draymond suspension for Game 5. If this doesn't prove that the NBA will do anything to make their poster boy look good, then I don't know what will.|Lakers|-10
Because draymond had such a big impact when he played today|[MIA] Hassan Whiteside|1
Yes because playing at home and playing away are the EXACT same thing in a closeout game.|Lakers|1
Lebron also dropped 41 In both, nothing the suspension has to do with that |[MIA] Hassan Whiteside|1
LeBron would not have dropped 41 in Oracle in Game 5 had Green been playing. We can play the ifs and buts game all day long, but the fact of the matter is that LeBron pulled a really shitty move to instigate a fight against Green, in which Green didn't do ANYTHING to warrant a suspension in return. LeBron knew exactly what he was doing and knew the NBA would suspend him for Game 5 because it is in their best interest to have a Game 7.|Lakers|1
Draymond has hurt so many other player before that altercation which got him in the that situation. If he hadnt kicked Stephen Adams or the numerous other shady things he's done that play wouldnt have mattered. It was only given a flagrant 1 anyways but he put himself in that situation to be over the limit |[MIA] Hassan Whiteside|0
What does that have to do with the Cleveland series? Just because somebody did something stupid in the past, doesn't mean they should be punished for it in the future, especially if there have been no additional infractions. That's like me going over the speed limit a few times and getting warnings from the cops who pulled me over, then one month later driving at the speed limit in a different city and then getting a ticket for my past infractions just because it's the end of the month and they need to fulfill their tickets quota. Makes no sense.|Lakers|1
There's a limit to the amount of flagrants you can get before it's an automatic suspension. So yes those past incidents do matter because they came back to haunt him and he has no one to blame but himself |[MIA] Hassan Whiteside|1
You're missing the point. He didn't do ANYTHING in Game 4. He just got up from the floor after being pushed down by LeBron and then being stepped over. If you honestly believe that that warrants a flagrant foul, then I'm not really sure there is much that we can agree on. If anything, the flagrant should have been called on James.|Lakers|1
Lebron got the tech for stepping over him, draymond got the flagrant 1 for hitting him in the balls which does constitute as excessive contact. What I'm saying is whether it was a flagrant or not wouldn't matter of he hadnt had the previous encounters which put him at the limit.|[MIA] Hassan Whiteside|0
He should have been suspended 5 other times throughout the playoffs.  How lakers fans can root for the team next door?  Go clips, am I right?||2
I will root for whoever I damn well please, and I just happen to not like teams who will use dirty tactics to win games like what LeBron did to get Green suspended, while Green didn't even do anything.|Lakers|1
Okay, LeBron is a fucking lion. But don't forget, Kobe > LeBron 4ever.\n\nKobe would have done what LeBron did, but *with* the triple double.|Lakers|-10
And 12 for 34 shooting||5
I will personally fight anyone claiming Lebron to be in the top five players of all time.\n\nNaked.|Warriors Bandwagon|-12
LeBron is in the top 5 of players. I'll even say he's tied for #1. |[CLE] LeBron James|1
You certainly have your bias goggles on don't you. |Lakers|-2
I'm not the only one who thinks this, so there's that. |[CLE] LeBron James|2
I think it too. Is it really hard to believe that after 20 years that someone hasn't rivaled MJ? |Cavaliers|1
I also agree (i thought a non-cavs fan would help)|[TOR] Bismack Biyombo|3
The best player of all time can't shoot?|Charlotte Hornets|0
He's doing a great job this series of shooting. |[CLE] LeBron James|2
I'm gonna enjoy this.   Oil ?|Celtics|2
As a fan of a neutral team here, I have never seen that big a shift in the calling of a game. Not saying it was rigged, but that was the most ticky-tacky fouls I've ever seen, and it's even worse coming off the rest of the series, where the refs just let the teams play. I can understand the Warriors fans being pissed as all hell. I'm pissed as all hell, and I don't even have a dog in this fight. You can't just change from not calling anything to calling everything in one game. It makes for a game that looks really, really suspicious. |Celtics|-4
Lebron the nba diva lmao.you cant touch the dude|Warriors|-4
the last 7ish minutes of that game are why there are people who think this league is rigged|Mavericks|-4
And those people are stupid|Knicks|12
Perhaps, but the calls during the most important minutes of this game were awful, and I agree with curry's reaction. Like, I'm weakly rooting for the Cavs as much as a non-fan of these teams can, and it seemed pretty fucking terrible the way things went down the stretch. |Mavericks|0
The calls were even all night. Each team finished with 25. So what if Curry got ejected. It had little to no impact on the outcome of the game.\n\nGSW missed their own shots in the end. |[CLE] LeBron James|3
I believe you meant to say that the NBA defeated the Warriors. |Knicks|-14
All because the NBA wanted more money. Hilarious.||-16
The NBA doesn't make any money off of a game 7. They already have a set TV contract in place. They generate more buzz but it does not necessarily equal more money. Stop whining.|Suns|2

Can somebody link me a streamable of the strip on Irving that was whistled by the guy in the back who looked to me like he couldn't have even seen it? (Think it was Mauers but wanna see it again.)|Warriors|-5
That was a blatant foul. If you don't see it, then you are biased. There was so much contact it wasn't even a question that it was a foul.|[MIA] Chris Bosh|4
The strip itself was clean, the body contact leading up to it however was a foul.|Cavaliers|2
Okay, but that is a foul then. If you have to foul to get the strip, it is a foul.|[MIA] Chris Bosh|2
I agree, but this is why the call is "controversial", people are looking at the ball, not the body.|Cavaliers|1
Sure felt like the league wanted a game seven ||-6
I hate the Cavaliers so much. I'm not even a Golden State fan, I have just always hated the Cavs, but my hate for them has tripled since this series began. And can someone explain to me how the technically best team in the history of the NBA is going to Game 7 versus the Cleveland Cavaliers. This either rigged or Golden State were lucky to break the most wins record. My money is on rigged.||-22
Best team in history hasn't really played well in the playoffs, and they barely managed to get to the finals.||1
The ball isnt going in the basket for the warriors. Idk how you can call that rigged||3
Best team in history can\xc2\xb4t beat the best player of all-time. But have no fear, go to youtube.com and type Justin Timberlake- Cry me a River. \n\nYou can thank me later fuckboy|Cavaliers|4
LeBron is not the best player of all time.|Charlotte Hornets|1
The best is MJ. Unless Lebron beats the best team of all-time with the first unanimous 2 time MVP.|Cavaliers|1
Uhh the best team of all time had Jordan on it|Celtics|1
Record wise they are and will be considered the best team in history. If the Cavs win everyone will say they suck, but if they win, it will be second title in a row and with the best record ever. The amount of talent that GSW team has in insane because everyone is underpaid, while in Cleveland Shumpert gets 10 million, TT 16 mil/yr and Love is on a max also.|Cavaliers|1
No they won't. Greatest regular season? Yes. But certainly not the best team. And if we're going to compare wins, let's include the playoffs, where the Bulls have a much superior record. \n\nBulls finished 87-13 with a ring. The best the Warriors can finish is 89-17. One messily game during the regular season does not equate to 4 playoff losses. |Celtics|1
The best player of all time is able to shoot the ball. Lebron is top 3 at best. |Charlotte Hornets|1
You are *nuts*|Bulls|5
The cavs haven't won anything ever, how could you hate them?\n\nAs for rigged, draymond got himself suspended. Did the league make the warriors score 11 points in the first or get down by 20?  \n\nLove how salty you are ||4

Honestly, now I just want the Warriors to win so Lebron has to accept his MVP trophy, while his teammates are in the locker room and the Warriors are celebrating.|Warriors|-17
What about wanting to win because you're a fan of the team? That's probably a good reason too.|Celtics|2
With your shitty fans booing him the entire time. ||3
If that's why you want the Warriors to win then you don't deserve to be their fan during the success.|Raptors|6
