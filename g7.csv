What if Varejao came out in Cavs gear right now\n\n"hey guys what I miss?"|Hawks|2052
heard he still got a ring is that true|Thunder|1
Due to a loophole he's eligible for a ring no matter who wins but owner/management would have to sign off on it. Gilbert doesn't seem like the type to let that happen.||3
i've met the man, and he's exactly the type of person to let that happen. varejo played for cleveland for 12 years.|Cavaliers Bandwagon|1
After those flops do you blame him||1
Yeah but he flopped in the wine and gold for a very long time. ||2
So you're saying Dan Gilbert wouldn't give a ring to a player who played for his team for 12 years and only doesn't now because he was traded?  There's no bad blood.  He played for them this season.  He was part of the championship and will get the ring he deserves.  Even if Gilbert for some crazy reason didn't want him to get one, LeBron loves him and LeBron runs the organization. |[MIL] Vin Baker|10
the real MVP?|Rockets|1
Varejao comes in "hey guys what i miss?", Cavs-"nothing just talking about all those flops you pulled on us"|[CHI] Jimmy Butler|2
[Uh...](http://deadspin.com/whatever-happens-anderson-varejao-is-going-to-be-a-dud-1780225024)||7
fuck that||0
It'll never happen cause Gilbert would have to sign off on it but to be fair he's been a cavalier way longer than he's been a warrior. ||3
[That URL tho](https://i.sli.mg/Sz67s9.png)|Cavaliers|1
He'd have to flop all over the court first. ||5

This and the comment above made me literally laugh out loud. |Celtics|2
I tried, but after that game, my voice broke.|Cavaliers|2
Lol imagine he tries to join in for the team photo.||316
Falls over due to a slight breeze and isn't included in the picture anyway|Bucks|9
But they let him, because "It was me, Steve! It was me all along." \\**rips off his shirt to reveal Cavs jersey beneath Warriors one*\\*|Spurs|81
that -9 in 8 minutes certainly helped!|Cavaliers|2
THAT SUMMABITCH!|Knicks|3
You can't lock up the flopness.|Rockets|4
He cashes in his money in the bank that allows him to join any championship team.||14
Then proceeds to fall on the floor|Warriors|1030
Watching him in game 7, it seems like his posture is so unstable it is prone to collapsing. I think he does it accidentally half the time. He's just awkward on his feet and stands like a bendy straw|Celtics|1
OMG they killed Anderson!|Raptors|1
I dislike some guys on the Warriors, but there's probably no one I dislike in basketball more than him. He just ruins the game with all that BS||8
I think it's important to make fun of him and call him out like this so that it doesn't become part of the game (like in soccer)||3
For some reason, I've always had an irrational annoyance with Varejao since 10 years ago. He's such a blatant flopper.||3
so is the whole spurs squad,but they still ball.Varejao is plain actor right now|Cavaliers|-5
The whole spurs squad are floppers? No...I mean one or two players, sure, but the whole team? No..|[SAS] Tony Parker|2
Clutching his ear|Lakers|30
and knee||1
The only reason he rocks that hair is because it exagerates his floppage.|Bucks|21
The much-maligned Kevin Love with the defensive possession of his life.||2084
I stopped breathing during those moments.|Bulls|1
Dude I don't get it (maybe his knee is more injured than we think?) but how the fuck do power forwards guard curry? Tristian, Love? Like dude blow by them and hit a runner. |Celtics|5
They were down by 3|Hawks|1
Curry did that plenty in the regular season. Dude was hellbent on taking 3s today. ||2
He wanted a three or nothing||19
Yeah he's gotta take it to the hole and either score and kick out. But live by the 3 die by the 3|Celtics|2
That's what be admitted in post game as well.|Knicks|2
That often seems to be the case for Curry and Klay both. They'll dribble away from the basket to get to the 3 point line a lot of the time. Works a lot too lol.|Thunder|3
Looks really foolish when it doesn't work. Also part of the reason I find it hard to like the Warriors. The constant looking for a 3 when there's better plays is pretty annoying.|[SAC] Rudy Gay|3
One of my favorite things in basketball is the bricked fastbreak transition 3.  GS doesn't do it very often (the bricking part) but it's glorious when it happens.|Cavaliers|1
I mean, who are we to judge what's considered a better play for two individuals that headed the best regular season team in NBA history?||2
That happened often in the series. They kept trying to switch Thompson onto Curry in previous games and Thompson would lock him up. As well.|Raptors|2
LeBron will forever be remembered for his block, not his dunk.\n\nKevin Love will forever be remembered for his perimeter defense. Wow.||2
Rumors of his death were greatly exaggerated |Cavaliers|3
FIRST TEAM ALL CLUTCH DEFENSE!|Spurs|3
That was the best defense I've seen, and at the best time imaginable.||11
I thought love has been getting a lot of over exaggerated hate in this sub, it was good to see him close out strong|[DAL] Jamal Mashburn|8
Steph Curry, unanimous MVP, forced into taking a contested pull up three by an unathletic big man who is constantly criticized for defense. Absolutely insane defense from Love, he wanted the win just as bad as anyone out there|[MIA] Dwyane Wade|17
Usually you have to worry about curry going for the 3 or driving Kevin literally gave him 2 points with a wide open lane and curry just got caught up in the moment and tried to force it||3
I mean they were down by three anyways, and Curry probably had PTSD from trying to drive the lane into LeBron earlier, plus the game 6 block|[MIN] Andrew Wiggins|1
The negative reddit comments really motivated him to greatness. \n\nWe did it!||16
My heart dropped when I saw he switched the pick onto Curry, but damn if he didn't step up big time in the clutch.|Cavaliers|205
I was yelling "BBQ CHICKEN ALERT" then the air ball.|Thunder|2
I thought it was over. I couldn't believe Love was doing such a good job there. He was seriously playing D like his life depended on him. He was zoned in|Spurs|10
I could not believe that. Draymond got that screen to ensure the switch and love ended up FORCING STEPH CURRY into a terrible three.|Trail Blazers|823
There was no threat of penetration cuz everyone knew curry was going to try to go for the 3|Vancouver Grizzlies|1
these days it was hard to tell what was a good three and what was a terrible one||1
Destroyed the boards too.\n|Lakers|4
>love ended up FORCING STEPH CURRY into a terrible three.\n\nIt was more steph curry forced himself into a terrible three. He had the lane if he wanted it. Love was doing everything he could to PREVENT the 3. Curry was hellbent on taking the 3 to tie it up. ||5
Terrible 3s were curry's preferred shot in the second half|Charlotte Hornets|870
He did have a wide-open three he just missed. He also bricked a somewhat contested three, similar to one he made earlier. The rest of his offensive game was terrible, and probably cost them a title. His behind the back pass to no one. His behind the back pass in the paint that went straight into Love's hands. He was not ready for this game.|Cavaliers|1
of his career|[UTA] Carl Kilpatrick|1
I think Lebron also scared him from going in the paint. That with Kyrie crossing him up a couple times must have shook him too.|Raptors|1
Terrible 3s were curry's preferred shot all season, only difference is they usually went in during the regular season||2
even got an airball or 2 out of it.|Nets|2
Terrible 3's sounds like his next shoe|[MIA] Dwyane Wade|7
I'd cop a pair if they look like the kyrie 2 gradients from game 5|Charlotte Hornets|2
Pretty much all season he's taken a lot of awful 3's, his magic just ran out I guess.||263
Or all season he was playing against subpar-defensive teams||0
Shooters are streaky. |Timberwolves|1
Yeah the playoffs can be even more tiring when you play the entire regular season like its the playoffs.|Celtics|3
When people say "Why is Stephen Curry so hated", that\'s why I dislike him a lot. Not his wife, or mouthguard, or being arrogant, or any of that shit. \n\nIt was that all season, he chucks up these god-awful shots from 25, 30+ feet with 10+ seconds on the shot clock, and even though they are terrible shots for anyone else except Klay Thompson, all people would say is "Well those aren\'t bad shots for Curry!!!"|NBA|26
For me its the mouthguard that does it|Celtics|2
They're godawful for other people, not Curry. He makes them at a high enough percentage that means he needs to be guarded at all times. |Bullets|4
and its not just his shots, he made some terrible behind the back passes|Celtics|7
Because a player can't go an entire season making those shots and still be proclaimed as terrible shots. \n\nI get it. He didn't even play at an All-Star level, let alone MVP level, this series. Or last year either if we're being honest. But similar to LeBron in 2010, that doesn't somehow negate how good of a player he is. It just means he has something to answer for next year. Are we just going to assume Curry forgets how to shoot and he becomes a 38% 3 PT shooter the rest of his career? I would hope not. |Bulls|45
Curry was tired after a long season and for a small player that relies on quickness this will be his achilles heel.  He probably run a few miles more than any other players on court the way he plays and that wears him out at the end.||1
Curry still shot over 40% from 3 in the finals.|[HOU] Yao Ming|3
Personally that's what I'm hoping for.\n\nI'm aware this will not be popular.||23
I hope so, I fucking hate him||3
Like when Nick Anderson missed 4 straight free throws in the Finals to win game 1 and it destroyed him. Went from a 74% shooter to a 40% shooter the next season.\n\nEdit. nvm, he had a season of 69% before the 40%.|Trail Blazers|5
A voice of reason on r/nba?||10
I have such an anti-Curry boner right now it's not even funny|Charlotte Hornets|410
Better get over it - he could be coming home to your team some day||1
That would be awesome, but until then I'm happy enough with Kemba. He's exciting in his own right. |Charlotte Hornets|1
Kemba is pretty amazing. They had a good season this year, I'm hoping they can keep up the progress.\n\nI'm from North Carolina (shoutout to /r/NorthCarolina, which I moderate) and was stoked that the Buzz was, indeed, brought back.||2
Go see a doctor if it lasts longer than 7 games|Lakers|249
Already meta and I love it||0
I think Curry actually is about to see a doctor about a few injuries|Bulls|1
Curry should've seen a doctor after the series lasted longer then game 5. ||1
its called priapism ppl||6
Imagine if LeBron actually made that dunk at the end. |76ers|954
I think the injury, missing the first free throw, and hitting the second is more symbolic. Despite being the best player in the world, he's been given hell from the media and regarded as soft time and time again, but he nails the huge free throw with a (at least somewhat) injured elboy to put it out of reach despite writhing in pain a second earlier.||1
Anyone got a link of it?|Bulls|1
I would probably be speaking in tongues. |Raptors|1
green literally pushed him back away from the hoop.||1
The refs would have probably ended the game early after that |Heat|1
The Q would've spontaneously combusted |Celtics|1
Doesn't need it after that block.|Celtics|1
It would be the greatest image of his whole career, a stamp of dominance.|Suns|2
He had his WHOLE SOUL in that dunk!!||2
I was at the Cavs' watch party. I've never heard an intake of breath like when he was soaring up for that dunk. We would have legitimately torn the Q down. ||2
Would have been iconic|NBA|2
Draymond woulda had permanent crying jordan attached to his face.  |Warriors|3
That close to the biggest poster of all time, with Green on the other end too, DAMNIT I'm still kind of upset he couldn't throw it down lol\n\nI damn near leaped off my couch as I saw him about to put the stamp down on history...|Jason Willams|3
I'm just glad he didn't break his wrist or injure it badly.|Lakers|3
I would've spontaneously combusted on my couch.|Spurs|7
I might have ran to Cleveland.|Thunder|6
Don't mess with destiny. If lebron made that dunk, I think the shift in the cosmos would either negate the Kyrie 3-dagger or force the Curry hail mary 3. The events unfolded as destiny ordained, and so it was written in NBA lore. |Raptors Bandwagon|5
The ending of this one is gonna be remembered for a long long time. That was beautiful. |Thunder|2
I actually prefer that he didn't. The drama of Lebron stepping to the line with a hurt wrist with a chance to put the game out of reach was so dramatic. So dramatic that it probably took a year off my life, but it was worth it.|Cavaliers|34
Agree 100%\n\n2016 male actor of the year > a sweet dunk|[SAC] DeMarcus Cousins|-14
ALL INJURIES ARE FAKE||2
See what I mean?\n\nHad me for a second, too|[SAC] DeMarcus Cousins|1
Nah, that award goes to Varejao.|Mavericks|8
Youre giving the man *way* too much credit. Terrible actor imo.\n\nLebrons wrist scene? Performance of a generation|[SAC] DeMarcus Cousins|-5
Espessially after missing that first free throw, really had me questioning if he could make the 2nd with the condition his wrist was in.  But he made the 2nd, and essentially sealed the game in dramatic fashion.|Celtics|2
We're debating which of his plays at the end should be iconic, that's how great that guy is||32
It would be the iconic image of his career. That would have been unreal. |[PHI] Julius Erving|380
Reminds me of Kawhi[ missing the dunk on Birdman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fk-3IY9vUaM) in the 2014 finals.|Knicks|1
I have a fantasy of Lebron making a last second epic dunk like that and shattering the backboard.   Then slowly walking to center court still holding the rim in his hand and holding it above his head as a taunt to the Warriors fans a la  Mad Max||1
LBJ could've retired there and then as one of the GOATs. Dray might as well retire as well because his career was just ended |Magic|1
Draymond would have been on EVERY Lebron poster for always and eternity.||2
I really hope that image from his dunk in the 1st sticks around. Right after he blew by Steph, you can see pretty much all of the Warriors behind him as he hangs from the rim and Steph has his head kinda cocked to the side like, "fuck." It\'s a great still image.|Grizzlies|4
the play from a couple games ago where he trips and gets the pass off only to slam it down is also up there|Cavaliers|7
I guess he'll have to settle for that block being the iconic image. |Kings|4
I wouldn't mind that' we had a ton of insane dunks from him this series. That block was the result of pure effort of him willing his all to win one for this city. I wouldn't mind seeing that as his career defining moment for the rest of my life.\n\nEdit: For the Land not for this city. Go Cavs|Cavaliers|3
*for The Land|Bucks|2
Very true. I'll fix it|Cavaliers|2
As hyped as the dunk would have been it's not even half as incredible as that block was. I've always thought Lebron's chase down blocks were his signature move that no one else could do better. Doing that shit with his entire legacy on the line was fucking iconic, greatest play he will ever make. ||3
Oh no doubt, those chase down blocks are insane. Only other person I've been able to see do it efficiently but not nearly as great as Lebron is KD. Lebron is a legend. In my opinion, the greatest ever. But I am glad that his legacy is sealed with that play nonetheless |Cavaliers|1
That was seriously the best basketball game I have ever seen out of thousands. Still just totally in shock and will be for days. 3-1 down in the fucking Finals to a 73-win team and they win the title!||4
I know I'm the same way. We just beat the (by w/l) best regular season team in the history of the NBA on their home court after being down 3-1. I can't even think straight right now I am in shock|Cavaliers|2
https://streamable.com/l1h9\n\nIt's still gives me chills ...|Spurs|2
Yeah, but he'll have to settle for the iconic image of sinking that free throw after hurting his wrist with all the pressure in the world on his shoulders. |Celtics|24
I'm pretty sure he just hit his funny bone really hard.|Knicks|3
Nah the block is now the iconic moment.\n\n||23
Yeah I remember thinking as he was leaping up, **this is it**, but then he missed and I was like damn. |Magic|142
I think the oop from game 3 is the image/video of the series...|Cavaliers|1
yeah man and then he falls and stars screaming and im like "we\'re done"||1
My entire bar went silent.|Cavaliers|2
He didn't miss. He was fouled. |Pacers|2
That effort still sealed the game. Draymond's foul was actually a great play on his part. But holy shit if he made it for the and one...||7
"missed". He was straight up hacked to stop that dunk.||14
We still have The Block. I think that will be his iconic image for a long time.\n|Mavs|251
Sorry, I've been at work all day and only saw the result here, don't suppose you've got a picture or video of it?|Bulls|1
https://vine.co/v/5Bzjb1ZIeJ0||4
http://media.gettyimages.com/photos/lebron-james-of-the-cleveland-cavaliers-blocks-a-shot-by-andre-of-picture-id541546580||7
Me and Delly had the same reaction||2
Great photo, but this is one of those situations where the photo does the moment no justice at all.  This is one of those plays where you need the video to appreciate how far out of nowhere LeBron came to smash that ball into the backboard.\n\nThat photo almost looks as if the tall guy just jumped up and blocked the short guy like it was no big deal.|Cavaliers|3
Still you can see how much ball LBJ got from that block.  Incredible.  He didn't have his 41pt game last night but just by having him on the floor clanking mid range jumpers changed everything||1
Haha yeah I agree||2
That picture doesn't do it justice||3
Cheers for that, I've gotta go watch the game now to see it in context.|Bulls|3
Definitely.\n\nI think the play looks a lot different than you'd expect from the picture||2
He just up there hanging out by the rim, like that's where humans should be.|Thunder|2
The Block *and* the Stare. Goes together. ||2
Might replace the finger wag?|Celtics|1
Espn said he was clocked at 19 mph coming in on the block. Insanity. |76ers|3
Cristiano Ronaldo Sprint at 21 miles an hour... it's incredible that somebody of LeBrons size can have that kind of speed and body control||2
Why\'s that? \n\nLeBron is tall, but he\'s proportionate. It\'s not like he has acromegaly or some sort of condition that made him large but impaired his athleticism. So in following that logic, shouldn\'t he be able to run much faster than the 6\'1" Ronaldo? \n\nAnd the whole \'tall guys can\'t run/be athletic\' thing is definitely a myth. A well-propagated one that sports analysts parrot sometimes, but still definitely a myth. I mean, look at how Usain Bolt turned the sport of sprinting on its head. Everyone always said tall guys couldn\'t make it in the 100/200m, then a guy who\'s 6\'5" starts setting world records and sweeping the olympics, and now suddenly the analysts are saying it\'s obvious that longer legs give an advantage and pretend like they reported it that way all along.\n\nAnyway, the point is that there will be exceptional athletes at just about every size. \n||1
I hope it becomes known as The Block. Would complement The Shot so nicely.|Cavaliers|11
It wouldn\'t surprise me.  I\'m not a LeBron fan by any means, but the block was incredible.  I was rooting for the Warriors and after that block I said "that block may have won them the game".  It was really spectacular.|Lakers|3
considering it was pretty much a tackle and a foul was called it wasn't particularly spectacular.  Now if it had been a clean block and GS had driven the length of the floor and hit a 3 then you'd be onto something.|Knicks|-12
Hea talking about LeBrons block on iggy not draymond foul on Lebron|Raptors|5
That block was clean as my momma's floors.|Celtics|6
LeBlock||18
To be honest, his signature play in my mind all these years are all those awesome playoff blocks sprinting down the court, much more than any layup or dunk he's gotten. Not just tonight.||53
He had 2 tonight.  The one on Curry and the one where he stuffed the layup against the glass. ||1
Agreed, NOWHERE IS SAFE.||1
He's gotten like 5 of those during this series alone.|Knicks|6
Yea but that one makes the league mvp look like a high school player. ||15
To be fair, Bron makes everyone look like a high school player.|Celtics|5
he even made others look like high school player when he was at high school age balling in the nba.|Raptors|2
Be nice, we all know Curry stopped in the middle of puberty, you don't have to point it out.|Cavaliers|7
Good news Warriors fans, you can get a free Dorito Locos Taco because of your Game 4 win! |Knicks|1909
All you gotta be is a FAN of tacos my man. |Pacers|1
This is on of the stupidest promotions ever, why would they do that?||2
because they know there's gonna be a game 4 played for sure|Trail Blazers|5
Hahahah||3
This is going to be the best tasting taco of my life.|Cavaliers|4
Well, after game 7 I can safely say that the free taco was worth losing game 4 :)|Cavaliers|5
It will be delicious. Victory tacos all around!|Cavaliers|1
I feel like your comment is incredibly underrated. |Cavaliers|13
Of all the reactions over the last 2 hours, this had me laughing the hardest.||1
it'll be the soggiest, saltiest taco i've ever had... Fuck it I'll take it. |Warriors|728
> soggiest, saltiest taco i've ever had.\n\nBecause of your tears, right?|[NYK] Kristaps Porzingis|1
Let's hope|Warriors|2
I know Cleveland isn't the nicest place, but I think they have far better things to do than ejaculate on your taco.|Celtics|2

goddammit lol|[SAC] Oscar Robertson|5
So, a regular taco bell taco?|Lakers|60
That block by LeBron on Iggy at the end ... Man that is a man willing his team to a victory. Came from no where |Timberwolves|2464
Looked pissed about last year's Finals MVP|[CLE] LeBron James|3
V I N T A G E|Cavaliers|3
yeah no one would question his resolve or his super star status after this one. |Nets|4
And that dunk attempt at the end... No chance in hell he was gonna go up soft, it was either gonna be 2 points or a foul. God damn.|Heat|4
For real. He couldn't get it done from the jump shot but he made his presence felt with defense.||3
Had barely sat a minute and still went all the way down and blocked it at the top of the square. |Mavericks|8
Just like Tayshaun Prince's block on Reggie Miller, but Lebron's block was god damn legendary. |[SAS] Fabricio Oberto|5
wheres the reply! :/||1
Sadly....kind of like that shit he did to poor Tiago that time too.|Spurs|1
[If anyone hasn't seen it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QJ4iwqnLKc) (Edit: about 20 seconds in)|Pistons|8
Is that Doc Rivers commentating?|Thunder|1
I think so yeah. I know he did the Finals that year for sure.|Pistons|1
o come on why won't this go away :/ just a lowly pacers fan enjoying the dramatic series talk and boom, this shit again. Fuck all y'all.||1
Wow, offense in the NBA has come a long way since then. 69-67 at the end of the game??|Hornets|1
The Pistons were probably the best defensive team in modern NBA history.  Also 26 blocks that game.|[HOU] Yao Ming|1
There were actually like almost 120 shot attempts that game, that was just a notoriously block heavy game (I believe it set a record). That entire ECF was really defense oriented.|Pistons|2
Jermaine O'Neal's reaction LOL|Clippers|3
The second I saw that I knew the game was over. LeBron absolutely dominated that game. Ho-ly fuck.|Heat|40
well it was actually kyrie who hit the winning shot and love who didnt let curry get a shot off on the switch|Bulls|8
[deleted]||3
No reason why...They were down 3 with 53 seconds to go. He could have easily gone by Love at one point, but was stubborn on taking the 3. Should have drove it and taken the layup (at that point love is hellbent on not letting him take a 3) or kicked it out.\n\nBeing down 1 with ~35 seconds to go is still very manageable. ||1
Well, they lost, so...yeah.  I think I see what you mean, though, there was more than one thing that went wrong for the Warriors.||2
True. I think it was just the emotional indicator for me.|Heat|6
He was making me mad with his decision making down the stretch, but when it was on the line, he came through with a sick block and then made that last free throw to give them some breathing room to play solid D.|Kings|5
He also had the patented "fuck you, I\'m LeBron"  3 that put the Cavs up 89-87 I honestly don\'t think that shot is getting enough credit. |Cavaliers|2
I forgot about that. He did. He came in clutch. I wish that slam would have went down and the foul. Would have been epic.|Kings|1
After that block, the Golden State Warriors (who score any number of points whenever the fuck they feel like it) did not score a single point in 113 seconds. \n\nAs you said, that block ended the game.||39
lebron was god dam legendary today. when nba 2k 30 comes out, youll play as lebron and replay this game. the block, the crying, the fall, this was the game that define a player. \n\ni thought the pinnacle of lebrons career was 2013 game 7, but yet again he tops it. i feel this is truly his pinnacle because of the circumstances|Spurs|20
The 2013 title was pure individual basketball brilliance. When the best driver and finisher at the rim becomes the 2nd best jump shooter for one magical season. The 2016 title was more about pure will. It was obvious that he wanted it more than anyone else in the game every night, 30% 3-point FG be damned.|Hornets|3
I think that saved the game. That had a classic Warriors run written all over it. He gets that to go, they get the momentum and might run away with the game.|Kings|41
I don't think all the momentum in the world could have carried Curry's jumpshot. That last quarter was all shots that never even managed to touch the rim, even had a layup which missed off the backboard so bad it could've been an alleyoop for Green's putback.||3
Yeah, that was horrible, but Klay may have found something. He usually does when they start getting some fast breaks.|Kings|1
I lost my mind when he got that block. If he would have dunked over Draymond there at the end, I'm pretty sure Steph would have had to give back his MVP award.|Spurs|68
I wish that dunk had gone down soooo bad. Just so we'd have those two plays back-to-back to look back on years later remembering the Cavs title.|Hornets|3
Dude I know.  That dunk would have been insane.  I can't stop thinking about it. |[NYK] Kristaps Porzingis|9
Every play since the 3:00 mark or so my reaction was "Oh my fucking god"|Raptors|470
Except sadly mostly it was just people missing. Just goes to show how hard it is to score near the end of a series like that. Everyone has seen every move. Huge props to kyrie|Lakers|2
That was my reaction every play. I was at the Q watch party and I was on the edge of my nerves all night long. It was exhausting and amazing. \n\n\nBut every possession mattered in this game. Every possession was tense.  It was unbelievable basketball and even better TV|Cavaliers|4
It seemed like the Cavs had ice water pumped into their veins during that timeout before Irving's shot. Before that both teams were struggling to get anything going, then the Cavs just hit another level.||5
I swear the score was stuck at 89-89 for like 6 hours||7
Everyone Fed on his energy I swear to god. KLove cuffed curry up for 10+ seconds of clock. |Timberwolves|22
After a season and a playoff where the two supporters were questioned,  Love and Irving finally came through tonight.  Love was like "every rebound belongs to me" for the first 8 minutes. ||17
Even that one early where he missed and Ezeli got the board, Love was just like "thanks for holding it for me bae, but it needs to get back into the bucket."|Bulls|2
Really glad I chose to revisit this thread again. Thanks for the laugh. |Cavaliers|2
That was a play you make when you just straight up REFUSE to lose the most important game in your life. Gave me chills.|Nets|1284
[deleted]||-20
Why you gotta do the man like that?\n\nI mean, he totally refused to lose last year too. His stats were insane and he was the sole reason the hobbling Cavs didn't get swept. There are limits to what you can do in a 5v5 team sport, though.|Nets|1
I know. I just thought it was funny. I was cheering him on all series.||1

I had to explain its importance and significance to some laymen. It was extraordinary. Space Jam.|[BOS] Bill Russell|2
Yeah it was a 2 on 1 fast break and LeBron comes from the back insisting on destroying the play and he DESTROYED it. So incredible. ||4
Two other things happened on that play:\n\n1) Klay Thompson let up, allowing James the room to make the play. \n\n2) Steph Curry, reigning MVP, passed. |Trail Blazers|2
Let\'s not forget "unanimous MVP" |76ers|1
Surrounded by GOT fans I had to lose it there. They legit think I'm insane for saying game 7 was better than episode 9.||22
Ep 9 was pretty good, but we'll all forget about it eventually. I don't think anyone who watched game 7 will ever forget what they saw, especially that block. \n\nObviously this does not include people who were shitfaced||3
Episode 9 was legit great, tho. That Sansa smirk. ||11
It was great but making the distinction with reality and fiction changes it  ||-5
Dunno mate, I could watch them both on my PC, which is real enough|Knicks|5
Great episode, but there weren't too many surprises in it. This Finals series though...  |Rockets|4
This and Boston game 6. One to avoid infamy, and one for all the glory. Big time players make big time plays|Grizzlies|114

For all the crap Draymond gets he's still out here congratulating the cavs. Klay is already in the locker room|[OKC] Nick Collison|4059
Honestly Draymond was the only warrior who showed up.|San Diego Clippers|9
Dray is a competitor. Klay is a great player but he's got some growing up to do. |Mavericks|12
Because klay is an ass hat. |Cavaliers|14
Is he really? Because I'm looking for a new player to hate on since draymond seemed like a decent guy at the end|Hawks|7
yessir.  Go right ahead and hate on him! :)|Cavaliers|1
Yeah I hated Dramond but my opinion is slowly changing after how he played and the classiness in the end. ||4
Klay is a bitch \n\nHe was poking fun at LeBron in post match conferences when they were 3 - 1 up too |Heat|346
m-muh man's game|Wizards|1

"Some people just get their feelings hurt".  What a moron.  Why would you anger the king of the basketball jungle.  You know what?  Thank you Klay for waking up the king||2
easy to laugh when you're winning.||2
This is the reason hes a bitch. I dont havfe a problem with players walking off the court early generally speaking. I get it, you just lost game 7 of the NBA finals. I dont expect them to be perfect.\n\nBut if you are gonna talk shit when you're up 3-1, call your opponents babies, exc exc, You gotta man up when you get dad dicked|Bulls|10
It's easy to talk shit when you're winning. Klay needs to put on his big boy pants and act like an adult.||6
Hope his dad gets in his ear about this.  |NBA|13
Well his dad was talking shit too|[OKC] Kevin Durant|11
It's one thing to talk shit, it's another thing to not congratulate your opponent when they beat you. I'm fine with shit talking,  I'm not fine with being a bitch when it's thrown right back at your face.  |NBA|7
My dad said something that stuck with me after the ECSF: "Never ever give your opponent something they can stick on their wall and be reminded of." \n\nThis is exactly what Klay did. He should have saved the trash talk until after the Finals were over. Instead, he gave the Cavs (and especially LeBron) some extra fuel to burn.|Raptors|77
It\'s a good policy to have. Belichick is well known for making sure that neither he or his players give their opponents "bulletin board material" before a game. |[OKC] Gary Payton|4

yea went straight to the locker room..|Cavaliers|1
My friend always says Klay permanently looks like someone gold a joke he doesn't understand...what a baby with his 2 for 10 from 3 performance\n\n||1
Guess his feelings got hurt in this man's league.||1
how does this get upvoted? particularly after none of the warrior fans pouted watching westbrook do the same last series? time and time again, the warriors fan base has outclassed the more popular cavs fans and temporary supporters.||1
He doesn't owe them anything. He's probably devastated. I hate the Warriors, but it's ridiculous to assume people should be out there congratulating people after losing the nba finals||1
This is a stupid comment.||1
Oh Klay played tonight?  Didn't notice.|Knicks|1
>Klay is a sore loser  \n\nI guess he really knows it's a man's league out there now |Cavaliers|1
He also played like crap. That's gotta wear you down. ||1

He just got his feelings hurt, have some sympathy bro|[DAL] Dirk Nowitzki|2
Ehh. I don't think you can blame a guy for leaving the court after losing finals game 7. Waiting around and talking shit is being a sore loser. Staying/congratulating is above and beyond.|Thunder|3
Much respect to Draymond. Great performance - he was really the only guy pushing the Warriors forward. Classy as well. Couldn't have expected anything better.|[CLE] Kyrie Irving|4
Not sure you can call a guy a sore loser for wanting to go to the locker room after a really tough loss like that\n\nDraymond is classy but there's nothing wrong with just wanting to get out of there|Celtics|5
His feelings were hurt. |Celtics|11
I think he felt disappointed in himself.  It probably wasn't disrespect.    If Green had a shit game, he probably went to the locker room crying too. \n\nEdit:  He probably was mad he fucked up the play before the last one. |Knicks|32
I think it's okay to be a sore loser after you lose a close grand final game 7 you've dedicated most of your life to. \n\nI get sore when Junkrat kills me in Overwatch...||36
FUCK Junkrat's stupid rip tire. |[CHI] Andres Nocioni|1
Goddamn fucking Tracer.......||3
Idk man, it must be pretty overwhelming. Maybe he just knew he couldn't handle being out there and thought it would be better for him to be in the locker. \n\nIt's easy to criticize, but it's hard to say how many of us would react in that situation. \n\nAwesome of Draymond though. |Hawks|944
Granted I never played pro ball but I played all my young life and you lose big games, as I am sure he has in his life. Those should teach you to lose and go shake the other guys hands. I have cried big fucking tears on the field after losses, but you always show respect to whoever beat you, at least that's my take on it |Rockets|1
Definitely a lot easier to be out there when you just has a monster gamw|[DAL] Jamal Mashburn|1
He walked out on Game 6 too, really leaves a bad taste in my mouth. So classless. |Knicks|4
As a professional he should stay on the court to show love for the fans. If it was in Cleveland he could gtfo no problem. At home though you have to be there to appreciate your supporters who just went through this with you.||2
For all we know he went back there to cry his eyes out and he just didn't want everyone to see that it isn't automatically disrespectful||6
But I thought this was a man's game? And you aren't supposed to get your feelings hurt?|[MIN] Andrew Wiggins|5
Exactly. No one is berating him because he was emotionally devastated after the loss, any loss is painful and a game 7 this close would b gut wrenching.\n\nPeople are on him because he called out LeBron for basically being soft, then he *hypocritically* expresses the same sentiment.|[BOS] Kevin Garnett|8
> it's hard to say how many of us would react in that situation. \n\nWe would all be exquisite gentlemen, holding the door for Ser LeBron and tipping our vicu\xc3\xb1a fedoras at each and every fine lady Cavali\xc3\xa8res fan in the Oakland crowd, allst while cutting down feckless weaklings like Klay Thompson with the cold taste of Nippon *Hagane* (\xe7\x8e\x89\xe9\x8b\xbc, or steel, for the ignorami).|Knicks|6
*M'ladies.. get it right. |Rockets|1
If Klay can't handle a loss like that (or game six where he left the court while the game was still being played) he shouldn't call out LeBron for having hurt feelings. |[MIN] Fred Hoiberg|3
> Maybe he just knew he couldn't handle being out there and thought it would be better for him to be in the locker.\n\nOk. What was his excuse after game 6 though cuz he did the same thing then? GS are the biggest bunch of sore loser fake tough guys.|Lakers|3
I'd act better than that if I called out LeBron James and told him it's a man's league. Like how you gonna say that and then walk out on your team in game 6 and (kinda) game 7 lol|Lakers|5
I agree it can be overwhelming - and he probably was overwhelmed - but Klay\'s always been a sore loser if you go by what he says to the media. When Kyrie went off on him a couple games ago it was probably the first time in his NBA career he didn\'t throw shade and credited a player on the other team for a win (and I give him props for that). Usually he says something along the lines of "yea they weren\'t that great, if I made my shots we would\'ve won."|Clippers|2

You can't say it's a man's league and that someone got their feelings then take off cause your feelings hurt. |Spurs|9
Why are you marginalizing someone losing a very close finals game 7 as "feelings hurt"? What is this? No one called him a bad name or trash talked him, he put everything on the floor and didn\'t come up strong enough. It\'s perfectly acceptable, manly even, to go cry your shit out in your locker room over it.|Pistons|-6
Did you not hear Klay's comments after game 4?|Bulls|5
Yeah I heard the comments. Yeah I agree Klay deserves some flack for being a dick. But to classify THIS as THAT is just kind of goofball status. Klay was talking about how one responds to trash talk and rough play, losing game 7 is **so much bigger** than being shit talked the situations aren't even comparable. Nobody, not anyone, is a baby for taking their time in a locker room after a loss, or a baby for crying on the court after a win.|Pistons|-1
klay has done this every time they lost|Raptors|13
I couldn't handle it for sure. I'd go right into the locker room and bawl. \n\nBut I also wouldn't have called out LeBron James for being too sensitive, either.|Jazz|454
When up in the series knowing the next game could mean the series is over i bet 99% of this sub-reddit would call out anyone LeBron AND Kyrie. |Celtics|-6
*99%*?\n\nTo be fair, I wasn't exactly *vocal* about my support for the Cavs after they went 1-3 during the Finals, but I was disappointed when the Cavs lost last year and ecstatic to hear they won tonight. \nBut Klay should be quiet. \n\nFirst of all, he's a professional athlete with a NAME to uphold and not some anonymous Redditor. Second, he hits 3s (better than Curry this playoff season), but he isn't even close to being the well-rounded player Lebron is. He'll never again say anything like the stupid, ignorant stuff he said earlier. He choked, and he'll have to live with the reputation of a choky performance in Game 7 next season whether people agree with it or not.|Nuggets|3
No doubt it was a big mistake on his part. Tbh it's fairly ease to be confident (more than cocky) when you're up 3-1 so i give him that but he's a NBA player and certain comments are good if they stay in the locker room. Surely he isn't on LBJ's caliber but nonetheless he's a world class player. \n\nUnless they win it next year I'm afraid the name chocker will be full on mode splashed wherever they go on road. |Celtics|1
Doesn\'t matter, he showed that he was a cocky kid without emotional control. You don\'t goad a guy that has owned basketball for more than the last decade after game 4. You go out and say these things happen, things get heated, out of my control, yada yada yada, and then you win game 5. You don\'t say shit about it being a "man\'s game." Any player with an ounce of self control should know the slightest insult can set off a superstar and be able to steer clear of doing so. Instead, he blabbered, and we got the greatest comeback in NBA finals history.|Jazz|77
I agree, when watching of Splash Bro's i always thought Steph and Klay were really humble and whatnot. Whilst the MVP has proved that he's human also a pretty good and chilled guy, the latter showed he's just a world class player with little common sense. \n\nReally sucks because now he'll get demolished by both sets of fans for a) poor performance since G3 and b) his cocky attitude that went straight down LeBron's path where him Kyrie owned him and his team for the last 4 games. Feeling sorry? Yes, because he worked hard but not because he was cocky. |Celtics|8
I agree, I was surprised he said it too. Considering everyone's attitudes, I wonder if Dray originally said that in private, and then Klay just kind of said it at the press conference. Still, it'll be a learning experience, he'll be back.|Jazz|2
Tbh anything can be said in private/inside the locker room. That's where confidential info are released so its fine. I just think it was unnecessary to express it in the media when you know they will make it worse and if it comes back to bite it through karma it's even worse, which happened. \n\nGreat learning curve from the team, a few big readjustments, and a change of tactics will definitely see them contenders next season!|Celtics|1

Did you notice Klay staying after to congratulate? No, because he ditched straight into the locker room as soon as the buzzer hit. ||1
Having met Dray and Klay at a football game, I'm no fan of Klay. Draymond though, it was great talking to him and he's a cool dude.||1
I wished Klay played like Kobe shooting 3-pointers and taking charge when everyone else struggled in the offense.||1
I missed it, what did drat, steph and klay do?||1
I saw Steph talking with Irving for a bit and then handshake/hug.  Klay immediately power-walked to the locker room with his bitch face on.  Draymond blew my mind by powering through the sea of people on the court right up to Lebron and hugging and congratulating him.\n\nIt kind of makes sense though,  Draymond just threw down a monster game, I wouldn't be too upset if I was him.  Klay seriously under-performed and I think he's mad at himself.|[CHA] Kemba Walker|8
What did he do? He just walk off the court and into the locker room again?|Celtics|1
Yep!|[SAC] Oscar Robertson|1
I think if anything that's just like the standard that you can expect and if they do a draymond you thank them. The dude is understandably upset about the biggest loss of his career. ||2
Guess he just got his feelings hurt|Cavaliers|5
Well. Considering what klay said after they got stomped by the blazers this year. It's pretty clear that he's an asshole.|Trail Blazers|22

Like a lawyer ||1
Yeah he's one of those guys. |Trail Blazers|1
I'd say he's not really a piece of shot on the court, he played his heart out and I loved how he didn't seem hesitant at all. Saw him help someone up too||4

I think he's just a giant dude who is too athletic for his own good to where his body can't keep up and makes him appear clumsy||2
He's the guy that if he's on your team you love him, if he's on the opposition you can't wait to see him fail. |Thunder|3
Perfect comment.||1
I think when he is thinking about what he is doing he is a great guy.  When his mouth or his foot gets away from him he can be a prick, but when he\'s "paying attention" he\'s a solid dude.  He has that little kid ADD sometimes.|[SAS] Boris Diaw|7
I agree, i kept saying how much i hate the guy the entire game but he made up for it after the game. He's a dirty player but still a good dude. |Cavaliers|5
Hate him as a player love him as a dude. He seems to be very charitable|Celtics|4
He handled himself well tonight.\n\nAfter winning the championship last year he handled himself poorly.\n\nI hope that means he's, like, learning life lessons and shit. Becoming better.|Jazz|22
God damn it, i love reddit.|Spurs|0
How'd he handle himself poorly after winning last year?||1
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOVVy2j3_4w|Jazz|1
Actually, he specifically said in his postgame comments that's he's learned a lot, learned things that make him a better person, things that will stay with him for the rest of his life. \n\nSo, pretty much exactly what you hoped!||2
Kind of reminds me of Richard Sherman. Learned how much of a distraction he was becoming, wizened up, and let his play speak for itself. Hopefully, Draymond is on the same trajectory, he really does seem like a completely different person off the court. |Supersonics|2
he's the epitome of the guy that you love when he's on your team, but hate if he's on the other team. Can't help but respect him- he's earned everything the hard way, and is incredibly driven.|Supersonics|284
Out of everything aside from the Iggy block this series, the most important move that Lebron did was get Draymond suspended. In reality, the suspension took him out for 2 games. All the talk got to his head just like the game after the Adams kick. |Vancouver Grizzlies|1
not really... his antics are taken equally in both circumstances|Raptors|1
Kevin Garnett|Celtics|1
> Can't help but respect him\n\nWe talking about the same player? How the hell have people made a complete 180 already? Dude is dirty, you can respect his hustle and drive, but he's dirty, makes illegal plays (screens) all the time, and worst of all, he gets away with it since hes a good actor. You're free to like him, but he's one of the dirtier players in the league. \n\nI have no respect for someone who intentionally hits people in the nuts.|Knicks|8
Oh no, illegal screens!!|Pistons|-5
He's an old school player in a new school league. If he did this in the 80s he would fit right in and no one would bat an eye. |Warriors|3
I know! Think of how many reps it took to make that leg kick look so smooth!\n\nKinda, sorta /s\n\nRiding that fine line of 'well.... it's not untrue...'|Celtics|3
Exactly, he's basically a Noah ||6
Noah with an offensive game. |Mavericks|6
I meant attitude wise.||1
He probably is good at ark building and animal gathering now that you mention it. |Jazz|12
Draymond...fucking played like a king today. steph and klay did SHIT.|Heat|2790
Showed who the real MVP for the warriors.||45
Not the MVP, but people undervalue his contributions to the offense. When your forward can play the point and defend all 5 positions, and your ball handlers can shoot like Klay and Curry, you see how big he is|Knicks|2
Dude was on point for his 3 game.\n\nGreat series though, all in all.|Mavericks|18
No one should be disappointed, this game 7 is one of the best games all time.||28
Yeah gotta give Draymond credit for hanging round to congratulate the Cavs. You just know it was the last place he would want to be but he stayed and did the right thing|Heat|41
I saw some clips of Curry talking with Irving on the court and stuff too, I think he stuck around some.|Pistons|29
I think a lot of the players also meet up by the locker rooms after the emotion settles and stuff. I remember Lebron/Duncan had some words in 07 after the celebrations and stuff||1
Curry, iggy, and draymond stayed. ||2
Oh cool I hadn't seen Iggy out there, good on him. Do you know if Kerr did his rounds? I'd like to assume so but I didn't actually catch it.|Pistons|2
I don't think so, Kerr got rushed to post game, they were already asking him questions while the cavs were on the podium. ||1
Curry did stay. They showed Klay walking into the locker room earlier though.|Cavaliers|14
I don't blame Klay.  If your emotions are getting the best of you, walk away.||-2
Ah okay, I thought people were implying Curry had left. TY for the assist.|Pistons|12
Even tho im a dubs fan, this series has shown what a one trick pony curry is. He was outplayed by Irving the whole series.   ||746
Ah yes, the ol\' "one trick pony" who averages 5.5 rebounds, 6.5 assists, 2.0 steals, shoots 90% from the free throw line, and plays pretty decent defense to boot. Definitely only one trick there. |Knicks|2
Was with you up untill the defense part||5
He was also double teamed the second he touched the ball every time. ||1
2nd in points in the league this year, 1st in ppg, 1st in steals, 8th in pg pct (insane for a guard!), 1st in ft pct, 1st in play efficiency, 1st in true shooting pct, 2nd in offensive rating, 1st in win shares, per game and per minute. \n\nIf scoring is a "one trick pony"...\n\nplayoffs are important for legacy, but to evaluate skill, look at 82 games not just 25.\n||1
u aint a dubs fan lol |76ers|1
It's crazy how he managed to ride his game for two entire seasons seemingly as the best player on the planet. I don't necessarily think he's a one trick pony, as he had a variety of ways to score but seemed to shy away from when it came to the Finals (of course defense and game plans had a lot to do with that as well). I think now that other teams and coaches have seen what kind of defense shuts him down, he'll be hounded a lot more on defense next season by even your average team. He's going to have to figure out a way to score even when the opposing team just sticks a defender on him for the entire game without letting him get loose. |Cavaliers|1
I really belive he was hurt ever since round one. ||1
Holy shit Kareem showed up to a post game thread. What an honor.|Mavericks|1
Oh come on, if Kyrie had missed the 3 y'all would have been saying the man is a god on earth for doing this two years in a row|Mavericks|1
Curry is a one trick pony in the same way Dirk is/was a one trick pony. The one trick is being really, historically good at putting the ball in the basket. \n|Nuggets|1
Ronda Rousey all over again.|Nets|1
Are you serious? Irving outplayed him this series, but that doesn't make everything curry has done in the past irrelevant. |Warriors|1
I don't know if I agree with this. You can't ignore the last year. His offensive game is still insane when he's at 100%. He definitely has flaws in his game, his defense particularly killed the Warriors, but he didn't have the same explosiveness off the dribble after a VERY tough playoffs and he was making a lot of those shots all season. And it wasn't just him. Harrison Barnes completely vanished as well, and Klay was too streaky and needs to learn how to really create his own shot. Curry definitely has holes in his game, his defense and his decision making come to mind, but a player like Shumpert is a 1 trick pony, not Curry|Knicks|1
I think the issue with Curry is that he plays so fast and loose in the regular season that the playoff pace hurts him. And part of it I feel like, is the Warriors imposing that pace on themselves. I don\'t know why the Warriors don\'t play the same way they do in the regular season. They seem to try to take less "stupid" shots and try to be more of an orthodox playoff team which takes away their greatest strength which are Klay and Steph\'s ridiculous range. \n\nI think calling Curry a one trick pony is an overreaction though. Kyle Korver is a one trick pony. ||1
woah cool it with the hot takes, he's back to back mvp for a reason and it's not just his 3 point shooting, he does a lot out there and there's no shame in being outplayed by Irving, especially on a night like tonight||1
Jesus fuck /r/nba is so fucking reactionary |NBA|5
Currys been exposed|Raptors|8
Overreactions up the ass. \n\n\n||3
The Thunder series started to shine light on it, but then Oklahoma remembered that they were cursed and drowned out that light with their blazing dumpster fire.|Supersonics|2
Dude what... I'm not even a Warriors fan but I'll defend Curry against someone saying he's a one trick pony. He absolutely played shitty this series but he still won regular season MVP for a reason. He lost the championship so now he's a one trick pony? Lol |Wizards|35
If he does not make his threes, he has a super bad game. He is the definition of a chucker. I will give it to him that he is a great finisher and decent passer, but he takes really bad shots and when he is off from 3, the whole team is going down. ||10
So if he misses his shots a score first point guard is a bad scorer?||-2
He is a talented player, but he takes horrible shots and deserves to be criticized when he misses them. I consider him a bad scorer because he has no basketball IQ. "It\'s a game 7 finals match with a few minutes remaining in the 4th quarter, I bet a behind the back pass would look really good on a highlight reel". Also, you proved my point. He takes 55% of shots from 3. When he rests his entire game on the 3 point line, he is one-sided.||-3
55% is barely over half of his shots, more than most players but no other player has shot as good as steph. The fact that he is such a great three point shooter though makes their offense work by the spacing he provides just being on the court, he also happens to be a great ball handler (second to kyrie if anyone) and pretty solid passer. He makes occasional bad passes yes, but the comfidence/arrogance the warriors play with made them great when it worked (see 73-9) and bad when they dont keep that loose play in check against good teams (15-9 playoff record). I wholeheartedly agree he takes bad shots but he makes them at a clip no one has ever seen before so he cannot be put into the same "chucker" category as say a Jamal Crawford who is very much hit or miss on a game by game basis. \n\nI cannot believe anyone who watches basketball thinks he is "just a chucker". He is a once in a generation talent. But yes when you do shoot more threes you are prone to some off games, that does not mean it\'s fair to minimize the rest of his talents. Would you call Lillard a chucker? Kimball? Any shoot first point guard?||3
Because his entire game is predicated on his ability to make shots from 30 feet away, I will call him a chucker. One in generational talents are multifaceted and he is not. I would also call Lillard a chucker. No, not any shoot first point guard because not all shoot first point guards only score from 3. ||-1
That 30 footer is the most extreme part of his game that makes him near unguardable when he is on. This is a silly argument if you cannot see why already, Steph is (at  28) widely considered the beat shooter to ever play. \nPlease name me a player that consistently hits other ever did the range and difficulty that steph does with mildly similar dribbling and passing. Klay can only match in range but he is also another top 10 all time shooters in my opinion.||0
Oooo||2
Really for Curry it's all about how the refs call the game. The physicality that the Thunder and the Cavaliers were allowed to get away with it exactly how you deal with Curry. If this series was called like the 2006 Finals then things would have been MUCH different.|[PHO] Steve Nash|3
Cmon man that's an overreaction. His bread and butter is his 3 point shot but he's still an incredible ball handler, play maker, and great at going to the rim. Sure the rest of his skills really shine when he's hitting his 3s but he's definitely not a one trick pony.|Heat|90
He still made a few (too many) lazy/junk passes tonight.  That's not good ball handling.||1
he did get outplayed though. curry is a great player who showed his weaknesses this series.|Lakers|8
He gets outplayed when emotions are involved.  Most bball athleticism improves with passion.  Curry's game is of a particular skillset that it only elevates with comfort -- ball handling, passing (as a PG), and long range shooting.|Rockets|5
He was a one trick pony in this series. He hasn't been finishing around the rim nearly as good as he does during the regular season and has been making lazy passes. Like so many times he'd try to bank it off the glass but it won't even hit rim. Whether it's due to fatigue or injuries slowing him down, he isn't the same|Warriors|9
He has to get rid of those dumb passes he attempts to make. I think he said himself that turnovers are his biggest problem. And then he does that stupid behind the back that completely went out of bounds. |Knicks|34
He's been doing those fancy one handed above the head or behind the back passes since the Mark Jackson era (maybe even earlier) and they've always been prone to turnovers. I think he stopped commiting those passes for a brief stretch but I feel like Curry and the Warriors got a bit sloppy or too laxed  towards the end of the regular season and into the post season.|Warriors|1
The shittiness of that pass is compounded by the 3 Lebron got on the steal (if i remember right). That swing changed the game|Knicks|3
Seriously, I told my buddy while watching that stupid pass that this is the finals and to win the finals you gotta take a page out of the Spurs book and play fundamental, showboating won't win in a 7 game grind like this series was.|Thunder|9
At that juncture of the game too. Don't make a 1st quarter pass in the 4th quarter. |Bulls|17
In a fucking Game 7, too lol|[LAL] Kobe Bryant|3
I AM HERE TO OVERREACT|NBA|53
Not really an overreaction when people have been saying for a long time that curry's game is far too reliant on the three. This is back to back series where we've seen him struggle against a more mobile PG. you can play this series back a thousand times and Curry still can't stay in front of Kyrie that's just a fact. \n\nThe problem is we know that and he does too. The coaching needs to coach around his weaknesses not straight into them like they did today. Draymond was on fire they should've ran him more and created more space for Curry to launch open and easy looks to get going.\n|Wizards|0
/r/nba is the only place where an unanimous MVP, who was one of the handful of players in nba history to go 30, 5 and 5, who was in the 50/40/90 club, who lead the NBA in steals, can be called a "one trick pony" and be met with unimaginable support. But you\'re right, not an overreaction at all. No one this entire year was calling Steph a one trick pony until the playoffs. But you\'re right, Steph is complete filth without the three ball.|[GSW] Draymond Green|6
The amount of overreaction in this thread is unbearable. It's like everyone who's been salty about Curry and the Warriors has had blue balls for the past two years and now they can finally explode.||2
Feels like a breath of fresh air seeing a Warriors fan admit that|Hawks|598
Any fan who isn't willing to admit that has issues. They struggled the entire post season to all be on the same page during the same game for any significant amount of time. Tonight was no different. We (yes, I'm a Warriors fan) would have lost by 80 points if it weren't for Green. ||0
Bask in it today for you won't get it tomorrow.|Magic|0
It felt like the cavs exposed him.  Guard the three and let him drive.  He will miss half the damn layups because he doesn't practice them.||1
Maybe it's the vocal monitory but Curry has never been known for his defense and isn't at his best in the paint. If his jump shot is off his game is off. He also tends to fall into a slump after missing a few, I think it really got to him this series. |Warriors|1
Lol, its not true. He's a one trick pony because he lost in the finals...makes sense. |Warriors|28
Well you gotta remember, quite a few of the people in here now started watching around a month ago at best.||1
Yeah seriously. He's a one trick pony because of a bad couple of series where his team was one game away from winning a championship. He must be the first one-trick pony to be a top 2 player in the league who can pass, shoot, and drive.|Bulls|16
Top 2 player by what standards? He gets over praised because of people like you. He got outplayed, it's simple as that. [Here's a picture if you still wanna tell me I'm wrong.](http://imgur.com/AadQtXg.jpg)|Nuggets|-1
Hahahaha you know that most people on /r/nba are knowledgable enough to know just how skewed of a stat that is, right? Its honestly amazing that they're so close considering the fact that, you know, Curry had chronic ankle problems to start his career and only became an Allstar in 2014. Everybody knows he was a late bloomer. But the player he turned into is without a doubt better than prime Wade and its really not that close. I don't really know what case I can make to you that Curry is a top 2 player. If you aren't convinced by everything he's done the past two years then there's nothing I can say that will change your mind. But one and a half bad playoff series where he still came within a minute of a title does not negate the fact that he just lead a team to a 73-9 record and became the first unanimous MVP. |Bulls|-4
Ask Dirk Nowitzki what winning the regular season in 06 was worth. Nothing. Dwyane Wade is an NBA Finals MVP and a two-way player. Defense is half of the game of basketball after all. He performed as well as anybody ever had (or very close thereto) on the biggest stage to steal a finals when they looked certain to go down 3-0. This game ain\'t about offensive stats in the regular season. In the words of Bron Bron in The Decision, "the only reason we play this game is to win championships."|Heat|0
So then does the fact that Lebron is three for seven in the finals tarnish his legacy in your mind? I'm not trying to diminish what Wade has accomplished, he's the best two guard outside of Kobe since Jordan played. But the season that Curry just had was astronomical and just because it isn't 'worth' anything doesn't mean it isn't the strongest indicator we have of a player's abilities. Someone loses in the finals every year. Its a team sport. The Cavs outplayed the Warriors when it mattered most but that doesn't define the type of player Steph Curry is. To say that is as big of an overreaction as people calling him the GOAT during the regular season.|Bulls|6
I totally disagree.  He's got a better team around him, but he's no prime wade.  He got outplayed by Lebron, Kyrie, and Draymond this series.|Pistons|1
>But the player he turned into is without a doubt better than prime Wade and its really not that close.|Lakers|9
I don't think that's diminishing his accomplishments. What Curry has done these past two seasons is fucking incredible.|Bulls|2
This doesn't even show assists|[BOS] Marcus Smart|2
damn. That's pretty crazy considering Wade missed like an entire season if those  numbers are accurate.||3
He's just bad on d and you can gas him with bigger defenders.  Not a perfect player, but great player.||10
Five bucks says he addresses how to play bigger guys this offseason.|Warriors|0
I don't think HGH is allowed|Pacers|12
He\'s as much of a one-trick pony as Dirk Nowitzki is.  Both of them just have a huge advantage in one area and they tend to "spam" it accordingly|Warriors|7
He's also an elite passer and finisher at the rim, so its dishonest to call him a one trick pony just because he excels as a shooter. |Bulls|-4
Steph is an average passer for a point guard. He gets too ambitious with his no looks and behind-the-backs.|Suns|2
He's as elite a passer as Joe Flacco is||8
yeah we gotta get these new r/nba dudes outta here|76ers|-3
He was a Heat fan 2 years ago|Timberwolves|106
Is he a Cavs fan now?||37
'fan'|Bulls|2
I hate Draymond, but he played great... I give him props.|Cavaliers|782
He was also awful the last three games. He was on fire tonight, but he was making up for sucking for most of the series.|Knicks|0
You shouldn't.||0
Yup hate draymond but handled the loss with class. I can almost respect him for that.||1
Yeah not normally a fan of Dray but he showed up big today, the guy was a monster and it was awesome to see some level-headed sportsmanship from him immediately afterwards. Guess he gets carried away while he's in game mode, glad he can put it aside after the fact.\n\nPeople are shitting on Klay for his behavior but to be honest I'd be heartbroken if I had lost too after playing as well as he did throughout the playoffs. May be an unpopular opinion, but he was their playoffs MVP in my mind. The most consistent game to game.||2
1 assist for a triple double. |Raptors|3
he earned my respect with his play today, as well as his post game attitude.|Lakers|12
I found a lot of respect for him, seeing how he fought through the crowd to congratulate LeBron and the Cavs.\n\nStill think he's a bit of a dirty player, but good to see that he's more than a decent man.|Mavericks|557
Yeah always felt that he was dirty on the court, but still a good guy off it.  Being ultra-competitive will do that and you don't get to the NBA by not being competitive.  It wasn't long ago we were all praising him for his response to the reporter baiting questions about the Texas flooding.  |Pacers|2
Being a dirty player doesn't make you a bad person. Adams, T. Thompson, D. Green, all great people.|[PHO] Steve Nash|8
Are you really calling Tristan Thompson a dirty player.... lol wow.|Cavaliers|5
I rate him because we're from the same city but most definitely he's the type of guy I'd hate to play against man. He's pretty dirty.|[PHO] Steve Nash|-4
Generally agree, with at least one caveat: Bruce Bowen. He is a total piece of shit. Has no issue with trying to ruin guys' careers with his fucking bullshit.|[NYK] John Starks|9
If we're naming Bruce Bowen then let me throw Robert Horry into the mix as well. Fuck him.|[PHO] Steve Nash|5
Yo that body check on to Steve Nash is still maybe the hardest hit ive seen in an NBA game, Nash was so fucked up like his free throw air balled 3 feet away from the net.||6
I got to meet Nash in person over a week ago. He seems so fragile that I can't imagine him surviving a hit from someone of Horry's size. He's a tough cookie man...he even claimed in an interview that it didn't hurt him too much and that he flopped a bit while getting hit.|[PHO] Steve Nash|1
I went to high school with Dray and he is honestly a very stand up person and was always nice to everyone. Games can get heated with that amount of competition, but once its over I can bet most of the players are happy for such good games and will congratulate their opponents.||3
The way athletes play their sports doesn't always reflect their personality. Off the court he's always struck me as a good guy. |Knicks|7
Steph stuck around too. Klay was too busy angry fucking Varejao while he just flopped around like a rag doll in the locker room. ||428
I really just want like...someone to add the Charlie Brown theme to Klay walking down the hall towards the locker room like in Arrested Development||1
That imagery. \n\nthanks|Lakers|1
I\'ll take "Things I Didn\'t Want to Imagine" for 500|Cavaliers|4
Think he gave Barnes a few slaps too?||5
I fucking lost it. Good lord that's an image I didn't need in my head lol |Knicks|8
God dammit I'm never getting that image out of my head. |Kings|36
3-1 is a bitch this season! OKC leads it and now GSW and they both fucked up!|[OKC] Kevin Durant|729
Spurs too!|East|1
The WCF tilt me so hard that I slammed cavs to win the series after game 1. It was an emotional win :)|[OKC] Russell Westbrook|1
THE MOST DANGEROUS LEAD\n\n\n||1
I would want to go 3-2 rather than 3-1 after this playoffs. Fucking clippers started this trend!|[OKC] Kevin Durant|1
What goes around comes around I guess! ||1
Classic mistake to go up 3-1. |Celtics|2
Should've gone 2-2. |NBA|3
Moral of the story, don't go up 3-1|Spurs|4
had no dogs in the fight until GS was 3-1... then i wanted their fans to feel my pain.|Thunder|7
Clippers are the NBA hipsters and started the 3-1 trend first. |Clippers|474
At least we never had a huge lead in the last 3 games, then again it was the Finals|[GSW] Calbert Cheaney|-63
At least we didnt choke at the biggest stage, with homecourt advantage, and after having a historic season, and a "Unanimous" MVP.|Clippers|25
> At least we didnt choke at the biggest stage\n\n... because you've never even been out of the second round of the playoffs.||-1
Congrats on your 2nd place!  History makers!|San Diego Clippers|9
For the record, I'm not a GS or Cavs fan, but the person I replied to was mocking GS for choking on the biggest stage despite all of these accolades when the Clippers have never been anywhere near the success that the Warriors have achieved. The Clippers have never won a second round series, have only been to the second round 5 times and have only been to the playoffs a dozen or so times in the history of the team. GS, on the other hand, has 4 titles in the history of the team and have been closer to a championship way more than the Clippers.||1
Notice how he doesn't have a flair. Next flair he's sporting will be the Cavs. |[SAS] Kawhi Leonard|4
Well to be fair to Curry he was the Unanimous best regular season player, he deserved that award|[LAC] Austin Rivers|4
You're bragging about not being able to get a lead? Lol props for not choking quite as hard I guess.|Lakers|50
So I guess it's still fuck the clippers then?|Warriors|4
I think it's definitely fuck the Warriors now.|San Diego Clippers|3
Fuck everybody!|Rockets|3
That clutch 3 at the end by Irving was huge. They finally did it. Wow.|Cavaliers|3517
BALLS. OF. STEEL.|[OKC] Russell Westbrook|8
He came there to hit stepback three's and chew bubblegum. And he was all out of gum.|[BOS] Paul Pierce|3
STEPHANIE CURRY HOLD MAH DICK\n\nEdit. Lmao. Stupid auto fill in. Although  Kyrie did make curry his bitch |[OKC] Russell Westbrook|6
Actually good defense by Curry too. Hell of a shot. |Hawks|5
Not a Cleveland fan but uncle drew killed it. Now I have a reason to buy his shoe.|Spurs|9
Best part is how smug GS fans were after games 1 & 2 talking about how last year Kyrie and Love being hurt didn't mean anything. |Kings|9
The biggest fuck you to curry, the Warriors and the Bay Area |[LAL] Kobe Bryant|1357
Fuck Kobe and the lakers ||1
and the fake ass laker "fans" cheering for another team in their own god damn state. |Heat|1
LeBron beat Halo on Legendary.||1
That final dunk attempt by James was almost an even bigger fuck you as well, I think it was on Dray too. Crazy part is young fella Irving set up that play that rewarded two more points again, the guy is fearless.||1
Twice in a week for the Bay Area. Sharks lost the Cup Finals. |Raptors|1
I am from the Bay Area and supported the Cavs because of LeBron. I don't mind the fuck you to Curry and the Warriors, he's the reason I'm not a fan anymore.|Cavaliers Bandwagon|1
The second fuck you to the bay area by a rust belt team ||1
The media is mostly at fault, I feel, for hyping the GW to legendary status after only one championship.||1
the bigger fuck u was Curry's airball 3 soon after. |Nets|1
Amen brother!!! ||1
So satisfying. Shutting all of those ignorant and cocky fans up.|Trail Blazers|2
At least they get to go home to the bay area and not shithole ohio||2
Hey, as a resident of the Bay Area since 1996, who loved my last trip to Cleveland, eat a dick!||2
Like watching the Sharks lose.....||2
It's like a Larry Bird fuck you three. You know, something Larry does back in his days to prove to the opposing teams that he's the best player in the game.||2
"Remember who was a 3pt champ before you brah."|Heat|3
Just fuck my shot up fam|Thunder|3
He outplayed curry all series minus game 1/2\n\nCurry deserves a fuck you.\n\nRegular season shooting god, MVP.\n\nPlayoff time? Nah, not even remotely close.\n\nHe's exposed.\n\nHe could barely outplay the  cavs last year without kyrie (HE HAD DELLY ON HIM AND HE COULDNT WIN MVP COME ON)\n\nThis year, kyrie proves who's the SMARTER Pg\n\nI'll take a smart PG like kyrie any day over a guy who takes and makes bad shots and tries cute passes all the time. \n\nCurrys ascension is amazing to behold, but he's a product of lazy defenses in the regular season\n\nCome playoff time he's not consistent enough,  and players actually play tough D. \n\neven if he can string together a couple hot shooting nights. \n\nHes a shooter. Not a true PG.|Bulls|194
LOL\n\nYeah, it was Irving. Go 'head with that. |Timberwolves|1
This is ridiculously reactionary. He was everything more than a shooter for 164 games counting last seasons regular season \n\nAnd then 2 bad series and he isn't a true point guard? The fuck is this shit idk how people can up vote this |[GSW] Festus Ezeli|9
it wasn\'t 2 bad series lol\n\nIt was 2 "medicore" playoffs in a row.\n\nLook dude, he can be god for all I care in the regular season. He can go 500/500 for 3s in the regular season. \n\nIts sports. its all about playoffs.\n\nbut hes PROVEN to not play at MVP levels(outside a couple games) for 2 straight post-seasons.\n\nWhat would be said about lebron if he was MVP this season , and he was in currys spot with his team up 3-1 lol? and he ended up blowing the series \n\n\n|Bulls|1
You think I give a fuck what would be said about LeBron? \n\nEverything people would say about LeBron would be stupid as fuck. Just like what you're saying.\n\nTalk about how bad he was in the playoffs all you want. I know he wasn't good I also watched them. But saying he isn't a true point guard and is just a shooter is so ridiculous I can't fathom how you actually believe it |[GSW] Festus Ezeli|-5
thats why I asked,\n\nshow me where he was a consistently PG first in THIS PLAYOFF series.\n\nhow many times does he get high assist totals?\n\nHes averaged under 6 assists a game man (for the last 2 years in the playoffs)\n\nFor a profilic scoring team, he should have higher than that. \n\nLeBron had a shitty shooting night. Guess what he did? CONTINUE PLAYING HARD IN EVERY OTHER ASPECT including defense with all those boards/blocks/steals and setting up his team mates for all those assists\n\nCurry HAS BETTER TEAMMATES. and he STILL couldn\'t manage a good assist total AS A FUCKING ALLEGED PG. \n\nDon\'t give me that shit about "hes a PG first"\n\nHes not. Hes a god damn amazing shooter. Period. |Bulls|3
Why don't you look at hockey assists? How many times did he make the pass before the assist. How many times did he draw two defenders, pass it off allowing that person to then find the open man. \n\nWhy are you only using the playoffs as stating he isn't a true point guard? \n\nYou could say he isn't a playoff performer and that would at least make some sense. But I can't figure out why you believe a ~20 game sample size is more affective at measuring him than 82 games |[GSW] Festus Ezeli|2
because 82 games of regular season..... how many half ass teams are out there? how hard do teams play REAL tenacious defense dude?\n\nlook at his playoff stats and compare them.\n\nThey are different for a reason.\n\nthey play TOUGH teams in the playoffs. They play SOME tough teams and some TRASH teams in the regular season.\n\n Thats why I don't really hold those reg season stats in high regard.\n\nI have no doubt curry is a regular season MVP, he deserved it, truely.\n\nBut if you can sit there and tell me he played at MVP form in the past two post seasons, than I'll have what you're having, because I don't see it. |Bulls|2
I literally never said he played at MVP caliber in these playoffs. Please find where I said this? I would love to see it |[GSW] Festus Ezeli|0
In fairness the Warriors offense doesn't particularly lend itself to assists; Curry gets a lot of hockey assists, similar to how the Spurs point guards don't have high assist rates.\n\nAssists don't neccessarily indicate an ability to pass and move the ball,Curry is a fantastic ball mover; he's not Steve Nash, he's not even Ricky Rubio and his cocky and lazy passes really damaged his team this postseason. \n\nHowever I wouldn't say he's a one-trick pony.|[MIL] Giannis Antetokounmpo|10
He isn't a one trick pony if you judge him by the reg season.\n\nHe's got skill and has elavated his game. No doubt about it.\n\nBut has he in the playoffs? Hes had some stellar games... but consistently?\n\nHe absolutely can win you the game with his shooting, but hes gotta do more than just that in the playoffs, and I really haven't see a lot of it. |Bulls|1
Curry is the Peyton Manning of the nba, great regular season stats but comes up short in playoffs /s|Cavaliers|2
Oh reactionary|Warriors|39
[deleted]||-2
Wut||1
Dude, it happened two years in a row. \n\nCurry couldn't even fucking win finals MVP last year when all he had to go up against was FUCKING DELLY.\n\nthis year he got HILARIOUSLY outplayed by kyrie outside of one game. \n\nLet me know when he's more than just a streaky shooter.\n\nI hate the cavs,wanted them to lose, but I'm  not totally biased. \n\nCurrys passing was mediocre and his defense was laughable and his shot was inconsistent\n\nThat has summed up his entire fucking play off run\n\nIt's not a hot take, it's a god damn fact.\n\nShow me where he's played amazing defense, took smart shots, set up his team mates for good shots like kyrie, lBJ and dray has. \n\nEveryone loves curry when he's on fire and can't miss \n\nBut dray is the real winner, leader and MVP of this dubs team\n|Bulls|-3
That's not reactionary.  That's something all basketball fans kinda knew but couldn't prove.  Glad real basketball won over that careless three point chucking garbage.|Bulls|1
He needs to step up on th d really. ||1
You're on the championship post game thread. The responses aren't exactly going to be measured.|[MIL] Giannis Antetokounmpo|7
Yeah I can't tell if that dude is serious or if he's just listing all the incoming hot takes|[BOS] Paul Pierce|22
We have a whooooole offseason of reactionary incoming friend. |[CLE] Kyrie Irving|12
You guys played a one man team last year. |Suns|30
Oh please. The other members of that team would beg to differ.||-6
Nah Steph legit got outplayed. Accept it|Pistons|87
I guess slumps just never happen? It doesn\'t mean he is exposed, but everyone goes through periods where they don\'t play there best. Curry legit missed open 3\'s that he never would have missed during the regular season. I just think he slumped super hard instead of getting "outplayed" flat out.|Warriors|-3
how many "open" threes did he really miss? maybe like 5-6 in the last 3 games. that\'s normal. He also missed lot\'s when he was forced into bad shots. That\'s playoff defense and intensity. It\'s not like he hit every open three in the regular season either.|Raptors|6
Yeah he did but he's also not that strong nor is he known for his defense. He's somewhat of a slow kid that can shoot like crazy|Lakers|0
I mean, he set the all-time record for most three pointers in a Finals series. But okay. |Pelicans|10
I bet he also attempted the most 3 pointers ever in a Finals lol, he had FOURTEEN today (which I know isn't that crazy for him but still - FOURTEEN)|Heat|0
He also tried to get stupidly cute with passing. And it led to points for the cavs\n\nLook the man is a an all time great shooter.\n\n But if he's not hitting shots, what good has he been???\n\nI'm talking this series. This playoffs. \n\nHe's defense? Mediocre. His passing and setting up his team? Mediocre. \n\nSet all the records he wants for shooting. All that matters is what he did in the end.\n\n|Bulls|12
That doesn't mean that he's a one-trick pony, it means that he's insanely inconsistent. ||1
>Look the man is a an all time great shooter.\n\nHe is THE all time great shooter.  As a Steve Nash fan boy, this was a painful realization, but it's been obvious for over a year now. |Bulls|1
I\'m def more of a Cavs fan than a Warriors fan for sure and was rooting for the Cavs tonight, but let\'s not get all hyped up about how "smart" Kyrie is especially when they were up 3 with less than a minute and instead of running out clock decided it was best to try to go to the basket and take a contested layup that he luckily got back.... That\'s not the sign of the "smart" PG|[NYK] Charles Oakley|4
'luckily'? bwahahaha||0
Hes 24. Hes not perfect lol.\n\nBut fact remains, he outplayed curry, THE MVP. \n\nHes took smarter shots and made em, and made safer passes when the time called for it, instead of trying behind the back cutsy stuff. \n\nKyrie isn't the smartest PG, but he was smarter than curry. and thats all that matters in this series. \n\n|Bulls|0
did he airball that layup and get his own rebound? or was it blocked? ||1
if this isn't a joke its one of the dumbest comments ive seen||11
This sub has the memory of a gold fish||8
> tries cute passes all the time\n\nHis behind-the-back pass attempt to Klay near the end was hard to believe. It wouldn't even have gotten Klay that great of a shot.||14
Kyrie does some pretty dumb shit too from time to time. Even if a majority of this series he was a maestro. ||30
Oh no doubt.\n\nBut everyone does dumbshit lol\n\nEven LBJ, MJ, anyone.\n\nAll that matters is how you finish.\n\nSo long as your dumb shit doesn't cost you the game, it's not the end of the world.\n\nUnfortunately, currys dumb shit did cost him.\n\n|Bulls|5
Wade has never done dumb shit |Heat|-3
The game winning 3 over the 3 King.|Supersonics|7
That three in his face, he will remember it for a long time coming. |Cavaliers|16
hopefully he be able to forgive and forget ayesha curry for drawing negative attention to herself and to him. People need to try to NOT be a psychic weight or karmic vampire.  Nice job Ayesha.  Idiot!||3
I mean the refs and league do rig the games in some ways||2
I'd argue that Love locking up Steph at the end there was just as big||29
That was just a terrible decision by Steph than Love locking him up.|Lakers|1
It was truly the time for the big three to shine. A ridiculously clutch play from each of them to seal the game.|Raptors|3
Yep, for all the shit he took, he was all over him there at the end to shut it down FTW.|[SAC] Oscar Robertson|10
Absolutely, it\'s a small example, only about 10 seconds, but I think it\'s a perfect moment to symbolize players being told to persevere through their struggles, "have a short memory", all that good stuff.||5

"Hey Steph. When you come at the King, You best not miss..."||3
all the needy kids in Africa can now get some dope 73-9 + 2 titles warriors gear thanks to Kyrie|Lakers|598
There was also some guy named Lebron. Maybe you weren't paying attention but he led the finals in all statistical categories and had a triple double in game 7.|Knicks|1
Maybe we can send them all some Curry Low 2's while we're at it ||1
And all the stuff every merchandise store had already stocked up on apparently. Looking at you footlocker ||2
I am very curious. Do those shirts really go to a poor 3rd world country? What happens to those shirts/memorabilia|Lakers|2
Yes they actually do.|Lakers|3
They won't even wear Steph's shoes. |Cavaliers|3
Those african kids gon be like damn the Warriors finally dethroned the King after his back to back championships w the Heat and Cavs!|Heat|8
Currently in East Africa. Couldn't watch the game because it was on at 3am here and I had work, but I'm gonna be keeping my eye out for those shirts because I got two months left here.|Mavericks|5
Yo if you see any I want to buy one||3
If I see a place that is reliably selling them here I'll make a post about it to see if people are interested.|Mavericks|5
I hope they get really comfy, unused UA shoes too.|NBA|57
I have stock in underarmour and I'm worried now lol||2

Clutch block by Lebron too.|Kings|982
When they were down 5 late lebron got a bs call on his three point "shot" That was the same shit they decided not to call in an earlier game.  He got lucky, game could have got away if he hadn\'t got that call. Then he fucking did exactly what lebron does, flop like a fucking fish on the ground and lay there for far too long after he got fouled on that dunk attempt.  I respect his basketball abilities, but he\'s a little bitch. That\'s why no one likes him, it\'s not because as he puts it "people keep doubting me" it\'s because he is a drama queen. ||-7
On a scale of 1-sodium chloride how salty are you right now?|Kings|5
Not that salty, I didn't care who won.  It's just I don't understand why he, and his butt buddy brian whindhurst or whatever his name is, don't get why nobody outside of cleveland likes him or will ever put him with michael.||-2
The Atlantic Ocean ||2
We're going to be telling our children about that block. Dat hustle doe|Lakers|2
That block early in the game on Curry *plus* the stare down and exchange was amazing..don't think I sat back in my chair after that ( and it wasn't even half time!)|Bulls|3
FUCKING YUUUUUGE block. I jumped out of my seat. So big ||3
Showing how important it is to be a two way player.|Trail Blazers|5
That was some rocket league shit right there.||4
To me, this was the bigger play down the stretch. Completely changed the game. Would have played out very differently if gsw went up two on that layup.\nImage how tired LeBron had to have been playing all those minutes and sprints to make a monster play. Unreal.||10
It flashed to LeBron right after that block and he was clearly tired.\n|Cavaliers|6
Plus he had that awful post up on Curry after the block||3
I mean Kyrie did score the only basket in the last 4:39 of the game, but that was a great block by Lebron.|Kings|14
Kevin Love also locked down curry one possession for a full shot clock|[NYK] Kristaps Porzingis|636
Yeah.  K Love really wasn't in it this series.  Game 7 he comes out as a defensive menace though.  Hopefully next season he'll come back stronger.|Cavaliers|1
For a guy who had been very quiet throughout the finals, that possession of D was his hallmark. I give mad props to him for that|Rockets|1
[Love's Chris Bosh moment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y994YFpvPJI)|Magic|1

That one moment where love had his hand down and steph sized up a shot from realllllly deep... that had me worried |Bulls|2
Those three plays are absolutely incredible each in their own right.  And if LeBron gets that dunk it goes down as one of the most iconic of all time.|Knicks|3
I love that all 3 of the big 3 had their moments in the closing seconds|Bucks|518
How does LeBron always have a big three when most teams cant even get a big one. |[MEM] Marc Gasol|10
I think ALWAYS is a bit of a stretch. The last 6 years he has had 2 other all stars, but thats only about half his career.|[BOS] Paul Pierce|5
He didn't to start his career.  After that he chose the teams based on what they could get/had.  Cleveland had to trade for Love if they wanted LeBron back, so they traded for Love and 'Bron signed.  Miami had to trade Beasley's cap for seconds to clear space for vet signings.  James basically called the shots and got who he wanted. |Timberwolves|6
I also think it was a little of the if your mom is okay with it your dad is okay with it and vice versa. The reverse catch 22\n\nKind of like "if he comes, I\'ll come" for both guys|Hawks|3
> He didn't to start his career.\n\nHow dare you disrespect the Big 3 of Lebron, Larry Hughes, and Donyell Marshall.|Cavaliers|4
He didn't mean big in that way bro |Timberwolves|1
and dont forget All-Star coach Mike Brown who never could figure out a proper line up no matter who he had on his team||2
Look at the roster of his first finals team with Cleveland vs. San Antonio and you tell me if you wouldn't look for some help.||29
I'm glad Love played well enough that people would stop saying he hasn't contributed much in the finals.|Cavaliers|65
Wow to his +19||54
What does the +/- column represent? ||11

I've always wondered this too. Thank you|[CLE] Kyrie Irving|3
Thanks!||4
Double wow that it wasn't for his shooting but for his defense|[CHA] Kemba Walker|17
Yeah I thought the game slowed down for the cavs with him on the floor... fewer turnovers and more boards. He played great||3
Lebron fucked around, got a triple double.|Bulls|2816
Shittiest triple double in game 7 of all time. ||-29
Theres only been two others to get triple doubles in game sevens?||2
Along with two steals and three blocks...such a shitty, championship clinching triple double.|Bulls|49
Damn, I thought people could see sarcasm. ||20
I was about to say that yes an argument could be made for that, since it was only the third one ever|Hawks|1
Sarcasm is countered with sarcasm.|Bulls|1
Everyone is still sensitive after the Dead Sea that was the game thread.|Timberwolves|3
It would've been amazing if he had flushed down that dunk in the final moments. It would have been the highlight of his highlight reel.|Timberwolves|22
Bruhhhh I don't think a human had ever jumped that high and cocked back a dunk so powerfully in all of history. That would have been so gnarly. |Thunder|14
It would probably the most memorable dunk in all of basketball history. A dunk over Draymond to secure a championship? Shiiiit...|Timberwolves|15
But it made the game so much more intense that he had to hit two free throws and missed one, leaving the W's with a chance. |Spurs|6
I thought he was having a horrible game, and then they tell me he's got a triple double. He just walks into it|Celtics|1
Lebron is fucking good||1
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMXJHmkzxsk \n\nEasily the best series of commercials Nike has ever produced.||1

I'm sitting here saying Lebron had a bad game, then see he has 27 points. Just goes to show how high our expectations are of Lebron. ||829
Not a good shooting night but he did everything else.|Bulls|1
To be fair, he was 9-24. But I'm the same, I thought he was having a pretty bad game, then it turns out he had a 27-point triple double. Unreal.|Cavaliers|1
Shooting wise, he didn't do too well. But it's cause he kept settling for jumpers. He wasn't as aggressive as he could have been. But he still had another LeBron type game|Heat|1
Yeah, Lebron just "scrubs" his way into a triple double.|Raptors|1
Well he missed a ton of shots in the fourth quarter so I'm guessing we forget what he did in the previous 3 quarters.||1
As Lebatard says, his expectation was MJ, but we never give him that place, even though his "bad" days are triple doubles||1
I mean he was 9-24 so 27 isn't that impressive, but his all around game was on fire tonight.|Hawks|1
He's coming off two INCREDIBLE games in a row, where he was shooting like KD. No wonder we feel this way, when he isn't knocking down every other 3.|Clippers|1
Yup. Lebron is so good a bad game for him is a game most people would kill for. One of the few people who could play Very passively and still end up with 27 points-11 rebounds-11 assists-3 blocks-2 steals||1
LeBron is a master of the "quiet" triple double. Everyone is so busy expecting him to take over in every aspect of the game that a performance like tonight\'s looks pedestrian. Never forget those 3 free throws as well. That plus the block were upper echelon moments. ||1
Apparently, between his scoring and assists, he had a hand in 52 of Cleveland's 93 points. Amazing.||1
Exactly.  And I don't hear too much talk about Splash Bros. piss poor performance.  They get a free pass and LeBron has pressure upon pressure.  HE SILENCED THEM FOREVER THOUGH.|Clippers|1
Man, right now I'd much rather hear about the great things the cavs did than what the warriors failed to do. \n\nGS acknowledged it themselves in their pressers that they failed to produce, and that's enough. It's not about them right now.|East|1
I agree.  But if the tables were turned we'd be hearing about LeBron's legacy blah blah blah.  Even though before the playoffs most were saying the Cav's would lose to many Western playoff teams.|Clippers|2
Well...when he spoils us with back to back 41 point games. He certainly wasn't efficient and it was Kyrie's scoring down the stretch and Kevin's boards that sealed the deal. They don't win this without his leadership for sure though. LeBron had a great defensive second half|[SAS] Tim Duncan|2
He just didn't have the jumper tonight.  He hits five of those 12 or so misses and he ends up with damn near 40 points again.  Kinda feel for Dray, his line was nuts.|Knicks|3
It probably felt that way because he didn't shoot very well, but he was involved in every part of the game. |76ers|2
if he doesnt make at least 40 he played like trash \n\n/s|New Jersey Nets|2
I thought so too, he even scored more than Kyrie (26) while getting a triple double. |Cavaliers Bandwagon|6
27 points, 11 assists, 11 rebounds, 3 blocks and 2 steals. \n\nFuckin scrub.||1130
but he had 5 turn overs. pure trash.||-5

That block at the end is what sealed it, but his swat of Curry in the 2nd (I think?) is what I'll remember. Just sent Curry away like a school girl. And you could tell he got in Curry's head there too because all he was doing was standing there and Curry just *had* to get all up in his face.\n\nBeautiful.|Lakers|4
The game 6 block too, followed by the one today. Holy, that shit would tilt the living fuck out of me if I was Curry too. No way words weren't being said after getting dicked twice like that.||4

I don't get why people hate Lebron so much. Is it just because he wins all the time? Is he just like Tom Brady or Derek Jeter? |Celtics|60
I don\'t necessarily hate Lebron, I just dislike how he went about his "decision" to move to Miami. That was followed by the SI article about coming home.\n\nLook man, you are one of the greatest basketball players of all time. Whatever you choose to do, just do it. There is no need to create media extravaganza everytime you feel like you are making some important career decision.|Celtics|-1
Shit if I grew up in Cleveland I would be looking for the quickest escape route possible. ||0
> I just dislike how he went about his "decision" to move to Miami. That was followed by the SI article about coming home.\n\nThen blame the man behind it not Lebron \n\n[Freelance sportscaster Jim Gray pitched the idea to James\' management and ESPN for an hour-long show in which James would announce his decision.(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Decision_(TV_special))||1
He is pretty amazing at marketing himself, true. But I can see why some would find that obnoxious.|Celtics|2
I think you\'re missing how hard it must be to "just do it" when there are literally thousands media people, players, friends, family, etc. hounding you every fucking second for days and days about the decision.  No way it doesn\'t build it up in your head and make it very complicated.  Not to mention, he was only 26 years old.  Still hardly a grown up mentally.  I think we always forget that these professional athletes are still just kids because they all look like such grown men out there.||4
... The NBA is a for-profit business. The fact people are talking so much about the move to Miami so much even today proves how extravagant of a move that was. So yeah, there is a need to milk it. Especially since the 6 million he made from that all went to charity.||8
Nah, people bring it up bc it's the only smear on his record. His letter to Cleveland fixed it all when he came back. The guy is such a dude.||2
Dude but that shit happened what like 6 years ago? Get over it||23
Yeah, and if you look at the way he talks now he's calmed down a lot from his early years. The dude has been hyped as the second coming of Jesus since he was 16, and you don't expect it to go to his head? I know if I were in my early 20s and had the world at my feet I'd probably revel in it a bit more than I should.||8
He's great, an amazing player. One of the best to lace them up for sure.\n\nI don't like his antics, his complaining, the Decision, everything about his basketball persona annoys me.\n\nOff the court he seems like a genuine dude, married his Day 1 chick, raises his kids, and gives his time to others.|[DET] Stanley Johnson|1
I like the guy. Just think people think he is cocky based on his "announcement". Regardless, he\'s the best basketball player doing it. I\'m a curry fan as well but come on. How often do you think we\'ll see a guy like Lebron? ||1
Blame 15 years of nonstop coverage about the man, unless he was literally Jordan 2.0 he could never have lived up to the hype, even if he's a top 10 player all time|Wizards|1
They're just haters plain and simple. Losers|Cavaliers|1
I "hated" LeBron because of "The Decision" - I had no problem with him until then, and now I\'m a fan again after he moved back to Cleveland.  The whole primetime special thing to announce where you\'re signing is a bit too much. I also only "hated" him as a basketball player - he\'s an outstanding human being outside of basketball.\n\nHe eliminates us from the playoffs every year too, which sucks, but that\'s what happens when you go up against this generation\'s greatest player over and over.|Bulls|1
They are probably hardcore fans for other teams. It's not fun watching your home team lose but that's the way the game goes.||1
People don't like him outside of Cleveland because he has so much self confidence. He comes across as conceded all the time, but he's just very self aware. He's one of the all time greats to ever play this game.||1
Gotta respect that he came back to win it but I'm pretty convinced he and the cavs made an agreement when he left ||1
Once I thought of him as similar to Brady, I started to like him more.  Definitely deserved this championship|Celtics|3
I think people regard "The Decision" as one of the more selfish and douchebag moves in sports. ||8
Which is ridiculous. Imagine having a company come to you for a position for a higher salary and you take it but also leave your current company. Yes it's selfish, but that's what you do when pursuing a successful career. ||5
Yeah, but he could've just did what every other free agent of all time has done and just signed the contract with the other team.\n\nPutting out a 75 minute live special is like a whole different level.||2
Well at least that $6mil went to charity, which trumps any personal opinion about someone seeming selfish. That good outweighs a lot of the butthurtedness ||10
Yeah, but he admitted that was handled badly. And you should read his letter when he came back - it was adorable and fixed it all in my book. People need to let that one thing he did so long ago go.||9
Yes. People hated Jordan, Gretzky, and Brady, too.\n\nEveryone hated the best if it's not their team. ||3
Jordan was beloved throughout the league, so was Gretzky. They had haters of course, but not on the level that Lebron does. ||2
You can't hate Gretzky. He's not like Jordan/Brady, who people could argue aren't the GOAT of their sports.\n\nGretzky had a season where he had more assists then every other player has had points except Lemieux, and Lemieux only eclipsed his assist number with points twice in his career.\n\nThe top 10 best seasons  for points, Gretzky has eight of them. He's the best athlete compared to his peers ever. Most other sports have people who approach even a unanimous GOAT. Gretzky is sitting on the moon looking down at ants. ||2
I think people get bitter that he keeps eliminating their teams. I personally like him though. |[DET] Marcus Morris|70
I was actually a really big Lebron fan for his first few years, and that's coming from a diehard Bulls fan who doesn't want Jordan to ever be questioned as the GOAT. Lebron lost me when he went to Miami. I do hate the idea of a super team, but it's more the idea that a player of his caliber should be tied to a team/city for life. Bird=Boston. Magic/Kobe=L.A. Jordan=Chicago. It's weird to think of his legacy split between two totally different cities. I guess we had that with Shaq but I'm just not a huge fan of it, especially considering he's from Akron. \n\nHaving said all that, I did like seeing him win one for Cleveland. As a diehard Lions fans (90s bandwagon kid), that city fucking deserves it.|Bulls|-1
the words "I\'m taking my talents to south beach" ring in my head when people ask me why I don\'t like LeBron||-1
He was also a cocky bastard who ditched his home team for rings. Seems to be well past that now though.\n\nEdit: you can't [downvote the truth!](http://youtu.be/tTgNlIEY_fw)||-6
He got to go to Miami beach and play basketball with his best friend. If that was something I could do in my lifetime, I'd do the same. I don't blame him at all. He can do whatever he wants, it's not like it's the law that he has to stay. |[DET] Marcus Morris|1
From Ohio here, as I\'ve said to people around here that complain about Lebron. He doesn\'t owe his home state shit. He\'s an athlete he can do whatever he pleases. Nearly every one in this state would leave in a heart beat if you told them "Hey I\'ll give you hundreds of millions to do what you love in any place and you can probably be the best at it / win the championship version of it." ||8
Yeah but he could have been nicer in general before and during that period. He's more humble now. For being undoubtedly in the top two people to ever touch a basketball he's incredibly humble.||-1
True but what kid isn't cocky? He's been hyped as the greatest thing to touch a ball since he was in his teens. He's going to be naturally cocky during that period. Just like Harper in the MLB. He was hyped the same as James and now he's just starting to calm down a bit after a few years in the league. ||1
I would have been super pissed at the Cavs organization if I was LeBron. Years and years he got no help from his front office who expected him to do it all on his own. It's impressive to me that he handled leaving as well as he did, even if it was messy.||6
2007.  I will always remember that feeling of hate and pain, because I knew our run was over.\n\n|[DET] Stanley Johnson|1
Exactly. Do you see what he has done to the Eastern Conference?\n\n Absolute destruction!\n\nLook at the Bulls, Celtics, Pacers, Hawks... Anyone who dares challenge LeBron gets decimated. \n\nKD is going to think twice before heading home. ||1
I'm a Celtics fan so I've seen just how brutally LeBron can destroy teams....like game 6....\n\nAnyways I don't know how anyone can hate him for it, he is by all accounts a classy guy off the court.|Celtics|1
It's some kind of Stockholm Syndrome I swear.|Knicks|1
Jokes on you buddy. My team barely ever makes the playoffs, and when they do it definitely doesn't require the greatest player in a generation to make sure they're watching the second round from home. |Bucks|3
He met my friend when he had a stroke at a young age, back when the cavs were here in the bay area for their last championship series. He'll always be ok in my book.||13
I can't right now, not for a couple days. I watched him play his first game, and the journey...\n\nI'm happy for Cleveland. I have no more words. |Supersonics|16
I have to wake up for school in 4 hours but I'm so fucking glad I stayed up to watch this game.|[WAS] John Wall|48
Once in a lifetime game. \n\nGet some potent coffee and swallow a no doze in the morning. \n\nTake a map after class. You'll be good. ||6
This was the first ever start to finish NBA game I have watched in my entire life. This was an amazing game, so back and forth. Are games normally like this? You can consider me a basketball fan from now on.||422
Should've watched OKC vs GSW series. That was really good too.|New Jersey Nets|1
Not normally like this but games like this happen more often than casual fans give the NBA credit for. People that say only the last 3 minutes matter don't know what they're talking about. You can find some good matchup that will give you a nailbiter at least once a week during the season and much more often during the playoffs.|Thunder|1
Playoff basketball is a whole different level of intensity. Don't get me wrong, the regular season is great. Things just go up a couple notches during the playoffs. ||1
Playoffs games. Especially game 7s. But definitely I think you are a playoff basketball fan at minimum my friend :) ||1
You gotta watch March Madness. I swear 90% of the games go into overtime. It is fucking mad! And make sure to make a bracket even if you have no clue what's going on. It seriously doesn't matter. ||1
This was legitimately one of the top 3 games I've ever seen. If you expect every game to be like this you'd be a bit disappointed, the the average NBA game is still entertaining as hell, as least to me.|Wizards|1
Quit now, you will only be disappointed.  Your viewing experience has peaked.|Suns|1
Most of the games I watch involve immediately giving up a massive lead, then trying to catch up, usually failing, the losing by around about 15.|76ers|1
A lot of games come down to the wire like this, and the players often exhibit a lot of heart, will, athleticism, talent, and come through in the clutch. But, this is the biggest stage of all, and on this stage it's rare to see all those things in one game with so much on the line. |Spurs|1
Yeah to be honest there are too many blowouts. For example, and this is what makes this game series so amazing, the Warriors typically blew out all the teams this season. Normally, typically the east, are not very close matches. The Warriors only lost 9 games this year, and probably 15 or so were close. I know for the Bulls, we've had many games hat were just bad in general... We didn't even make the playoffs. Cleveland coasted their way through the east because we suck. So this match up was great because lebron a legacy was on the line and the Warriors were just god mod because they beat Bulls historic run of 72-10. Even crazier was lebron came back from 3-1 deficit to win the series. I despise the  guy because he always stops the Bulls but this dude just came back 3-1 and won it. So honestly that's why this game was amazing. It was so close all the time, those are the best games. Games you can expect like this are big city franchise teams vs each other. Another great series was gsw va thunder this year. I love basketball. ||1
I'll admit that I'm a casual who during the regular season sees the highlights the next day. But the playoffs are awesome, just because they're so tense. You really get invested in each playoff game. It's tragic that I live in an area that doesn't have an nba team.|Hawks|1
If you watched this NBA playoffs, most games were blowouts and were rarely close and the times they were close, it would be ugly.  It depends on the matchup for games if they are going to be like this or not.|Pacers|1
This was a fantastic game, but the level of intensity in the playoffs is always very high.  I'm not really big on watching the regular season, as guys are pacing themselves much more than they do in the postseason.||2
nba playoffs have some absurdly fun games just like this one all the time. However, I've never seen such an enjoyable Game 7 in my lifetime.|Cavaliers|2
You should stick around, but this....was definitely not normal.|Grizzlies|2
All lebron games are incredibly fun to watch||2
No. The regular season is mostly terrible with some of these sprinkled in. ||3
What NBA team do you live closest to? I would highly recommend going to a game next season|Cavaliers Bandwagon|3
Australia ;) We do have a good basketball scene here, though.||5
Alas, games are not usually quite like this. This was about as good as it gets. ||4
Welcome aboard, took you long enough, get ready for a new hobby. ||6
This was probably the most exciting game of this past decade.|Celtics|332
it was super exciting but the quality of ball wasn't very high||1
Not even the most exciting of this years play offs. |Warriors|1
I've never really been much into basketball, but my brother watches a ton. Pretty much tuned in when it was OKC vs Warriors and games were really good. Followed all 7 finals games for the first time in my life and it was awesome. \n\n||1
What about 2013 and 2010?|Lakers|1
What about game 7 of 2010 finals?|Spurs|1
Non-finals game: spurs clippers game 7 from last year for me|Knicks|1
Literally nowhere to go but down from here.||1
Lets not get hyperbolic. There was a whole lot of foul shooting, there was no buzzer beater.\n\nThis was an amazing game. Certainly one of the best of the decade. But lets not get carried away. That heat Spurs game 6 dude.|Bulls|3
What about game 7 with Celtics/Lakers not 10 years ago? That came down to the wire as well..||3
Totally biased Laker fan so I can't help but agree with you considering the consequences of the Laker/Celtic series.\n\n\nThis game 7 was still pretty big for the NBA in general though.|Lakers|1
Finals ending yeah, but I still think game 6 of the 2013 finals was the best ever finals game.|Celtics|3
You're not kidding. This is an all-time great game. We are witnesses.|Knicks|12
I like the heat spurs game too|Knicks|13
No. This one was way better. |Spurs|3
Maybe because this one ended five minutes ago? I mean don't get me wrong this game was incredible. But it was tied 89-89 for the last four minutes and the time ran out with a speights airball. Still a top five game I've ever seen though. So many lead changes |Knicks|3
It's because check my flair :(|Spurs|2
Shiiiit|Knicks|1
Heat-Spurs was crazier for me, but that was more because of the environment where I was watching it.\n|76ers|6
Yeah, that game 6 in 2013 was my all-time favorite NBA game ever.  Game 2 of the 2011 Finals was also pretty great.||6
I'm still putting game 6 of the 2013 finals above it, but I'm pretty sure this one is 2nd.|[MIA] Gary Payton|7
Pause what about Game 6 of Heat/Spurs when that last 3 pointer hit to force a game 7 ||398
Wasn't a game 7.|Cavaliers|-2
That game wasn't really that amazing till the very end. This game was amazing all the way through|Cavaliers|-1
Never watched that game but I can already tell you that it doesn't even come close. What sets this game apart was what was on the line. Yes a championship but that's of least concern. Tonight was about creating a legacy. Either the warriors were gonna cap off the best season ever, one in which they came back from a 3-1 series deficit, or the Cavs were going to do the same but win a first championship FOR A CITY in over a half decade being led by a guy they despised, for treason, not more than 6 years .|New Jersey Nets|-4
You mean half century|Suns|2
Dude I think you should watch it. It was immediately hailed as a classic all time game|[DET] Richard Hamilton|2
That had its own legacy as well. If lebron cant win multiple rings after the "not one, not two..." shenanigan and having two superstars with him, he wasnt deserving of top 10 all time, moreso top 5.|Cavaliers Bandwagon|2
That was a great game but I think when you put this game into context, rematch from last year, stopping the unbeatable record breaking juggernaut that WAS GS, becoming the first team to come back 1-3 in the finals, and of course LeBron returning to win one for his home.. I think this one has to top it. ||1
What which series what game 6 what?|Spurs|1
Nah this was way better because the only shot Ray Allen sunk last night had a lime wedge with it. I much prefer it this way. |Spurs|1
TRIGGERED|Spurs|1
There were like two 7 point leads and a few 4 point leads. This has to have been on of the closest finals game ever.|Cavaliers|3
That OKC vs GS game earlier this season.....wowza|Trail Blazers|3
Speaking of that matchup, GSW vs OKC game 6 when Klay carried the Warriors - this season has certainly had some remarkable games.||1
No that game sucked and we don't need to talk about it really...|Thunder|13
Recency bias|Heat|14
If the Warriors could have come back from 4 down then that would have topped it. But yeah game 6 2013 best game of all time. ||41
**[*TRIGGERED*]**|[SAS] Tim Duncan|26
No they are not always like this. But there are a ton of games on every night during the regular season so you are bound to catch some great games often if you watch all of them. ||125

eh, i'd rather the warrior's players show up for the series.||-2
Agreed.  For as exciting as the series has been, this was the first game of the series with an exciting finish.|NBA|1
I think the series was overhyped because there was a game 7. But looking back, 6/7 games weren't even close. The mvp did not show up 6/7 games. LeBron only dominated after GSW lost players due to suspension and injuries. \n\nI do feel bad for GSW fans though, the team's and curry's legacy are ruined.||1
Yeah, foreal, I think I had more reactions to this than the LaL Game 7 vs. Boston. I was watching it in L.A, but it was pretty much a meh game, but this one, I was watching by myself outside the country and I was screaming, jumping around. ||1
Amen to that\n|Bulls|1
Unlike the 5 blow outs we saw the rest of the series lol||1
Yea, made up for a series filled with mostly blow-outs.|Lakers|1
Yeah except for the atrocious officiating that's pretty much plagued the entirety of the playoffs? I guess we just forget about that now since it happens like every single game?||1
Yep, and being surrounded by people having anxiety attacks|Lakers|1
Agreed. That really was one for the ages.|Nuggets|1
As a Lakers fan, short of the Lakers winning another Championship best game I ever seen.|Lakers|2

Seriously, we all just witnessed one of the most memorable seasons and playoffs ever|Supersonics|680
The birth of a real, new NBA rivalry. Who will get the tiebreaker next year?|Cavaliers|0
It\'s memorable because of media hype tho. The media hype over GS Warrior\'s "legendary" status is what bolsters the triumph. It\'s a bit unfair to both teams. \n\nGS had a great season, and Curry is awesome, but the constant comparing to legends and the mythical status GS received because of their sweep is what makes Cleveland beating them seem like they had to overcome insurmountable odds.\n\nGS still needs to prove themselves, and so does Cleveland. The mythical status of GS is heavily media based. I wouldn\'t agree it is the most memorable ever.\n\nBoth teams did an awesome job, and no matter how much hate LeBron gets, no other team has come back from that kind deficit during a final... they can\'t take that away from him. \n\nedit if anyone ask what I think is most memorable: 1988 Game 7 Lakers Win over Pistons came down to the wire at lightening speed.||-1
Kobe's final game too.|Mavericks|1
So much History.||1
And series for one player. Lebron in the Finals is the best Finals performance I've seen |Timberwolves|2
None of the playoff series will be remembered except the finals and WCF. And people will probably forget just how bad some of these games were|[WAS] John Wall|6
But the ones that mattered were epic.|Cavaliers|10
even then, not so much. Games 2,3 and 6 were huge blowouts. Was G7 the only one that was close in the last 5 -10 minutes?||2
But you could see people in the crowd having a heart attacks it was so intense. Like after that Lebron block that was amazing seeing reactions like oooob shit, to no that's a foul, to no a goaltend right to like just pure oh shit||1
Are you having a stroke?|[SAS] Tony Parker|1
Yeah tried to read that again and couldn't understand it. Think I was just jizzing my pants while trying to type. My bad||1
Yeah, the playoffs as a whole were kinda lame. Way too many blowouts and too few competitive series. But damn if they didn't end in just about the most riveting, exciting way possible. |Magic|5
That was maybe a better game than Spurs-Heat 6. |Supersonics|12
And all people did was shit talk instead of appreciate witnessing history. Best season ever and first finals victory after being down 3-1. Just stop hating and be thankful you got to witness history.|Timberwolves|17

Fuck off you sore loser. He cost the team a time out. It was a net negative to flop there. ||5

i remember my dad waking my up to watch the last play of bulls /jazz game 6 in elementary school and telling me "i was about to watch history"... this feels similar.|Thunder|14
lol no. This series, while a great basketball series, wasn't anything close to Jordan/Pippen and the Bulls vs. Malone/Stockton and the Jazz. You're lucky your Dad woke you for that game.||-1
I guess the "We Are All Witnesses" poster will be going back up.||25
SO SHINY AND CHROME||2
Lol Delly looks like that one fan that managed to sneak in to the trophy ceremony and celebrate with the team.||283
https://twitter.com/djacoby/status/744725747424604161|Suns|1
In my mind, Delly earned this championship from his crazy play last year. That guy put in literally everything.|Lakers|3
Why didn't he play more? didn't he play a lot more last year?|Wizards|7
I had to look back your flair a couple of times just to convince myself you weren't a warriors fan||-2
cavs fan for the playoffs. i was just confused, didn't follow the cavs too closely during the regular season but i remembered a lot more delly from last year|Wizards|1
I genuinely thought you were a warriors fan jokingly asking that, at first, considering how Delly hasn't been so effective against GS, except for a couple of games last year||1
They didn't have Moe Williams last year.|Hawks|1
Lol Delly is much better than Moe.|Hornets|1
theyre game plan was outpace and outscore the warriors with everything they got. Mo is a quick little dude who gets buckets. Delly became a mismatch that the warriors learned to abuse. |Cavaliers|1
The only really mismatch for delly was Leandro. Delly played pretty well but Leandro seemed to be his kryptonite. |Hornets|1
I think delly struggled against the warrior guards. |Magic|2
Last year they didn't really have many other options. This year I think they felt since they were in a much better spot with everyone healthy that Delly is just too reckless of a player to be considered, especially in these last few games.||4
Irving was out from a game 1 injury|76ers|16
10 seconds left and up by 4. It was all set up for Cleveland to Cleveland in the most Cleveland way in the history of Clevelanding.\n\nBut gosh darn it, they actually held on. They won. By golly.|Supersonics|2427
I legitimately thought they were going to lose somehow and am still in shock that they won. Absolutely amazing finish.|Timberwolves|3
After that LeBron injury I was like gg Cleveland curse. He came back.|Cavaliers|5

I knew from LeBron's block on Iggy that he wasn't letting this one get away|Cavaliers Bandwagon|3
All of us have some version of " there\'s always next year ". Been saying that myself for almost 50 years. I don\'t even know what to say now that  we won||3
I was thinking of the possible ways things could go wrong and naming them in my head... The Slip... The Foul... The Rebound... \n\nI still feel kind of like I am dreaming.  |Cavaliers|3
The Drive, the Fumble, the... |Timberwolves|3
THE COMEBACK!|Cavaliers|4
As a Jets fan, I know the feeling of just waiting for the wheels to fall off.||3
When Lebron went down I was sure that he had broken his hand, GS would tie the game and win it in overtime. That would have been the most cleveland loss ever. |Charlotte Hornets|8
Hell I thought Cleveland would be Clevelanded out of a title when James went down holding his wrist just before going up 4. They're up 3, they get the foul... and their superstar hurts his wrist and can't shoot FTs and let the best 3 point shooting team ever get a chance to shoot one more to tie the game, and then he can't play in overtime and it's over.\n\nBut he hit the second. That was bigger than Kyrie's 3, I thought.|Jazz|98
The 3 was bigger ||1
so what actually happened to his wrist? was it just a dislocation?|[DET] Allen Iverson|1
His hand can be hanging on by his veins and he would have still found a way to make one|New Jersey Nets|1
Shoots left handed, goes in so smoothly it doesn't even touch net. |Pacers|2

Curry was actually close to making that 3, and if he made it, it could've been called a foul on K Love. |Vancouver Grizzlies|1

If it was with Miami I would have been a 10th as nervous|Timberwolves|3
I don't know what to do with my hands right now.|Cavaliers|3
Lol me too! I thought LeBron broke his wrist for sure on that dunk, would brick both free throws, Curry would tie the game with a 3, and we'd be LeBronless in OT and lose.  That thought process is what Cleveland has brainwashed me to believe - but it DIDNT HAPPEN! Wooooo||5
As someone rooting for the Warriors, I was mad as fuck when LeBron went down. I was telling at the TV, "NOT LIKE THIS!!" This was the greatest Finals game I had ever seen in my entire life, and I was really pissed off that it was going to end with LeBron James on the bench because of a broken wrist. If the Cavs won without him on the floor it would really suck, but if they lost because he broke his wrist, that would have just been absolutely fucking brutal and just, the worst thing ever. I didn\'t care who won or lost in that moment, I just didn\'t want this game to end with LeBron in a sling. \n\nRegarding your other worry, I didn\'t see any way that the Warriors would get the ball to Curry, as he had been horrible almost the entire night.||1
Any other player and the wrist would've broke. But LeBron was destined to break the curse instead.|Lakers|5
It feels... Weird... Being on this side of a blown series. But I like it! Let's do it again Cleveland!!!||5
Masturbate.\n|Rockets|6
When he was setting up to shoot those free throws, triggered Kawhi..||6
I didn't know how to feel at first. I kept expecting some shit to happen that would make us lose somehow with 0 seconds on The clock||15
For a brief moment, when GSW was down 4 with like 10 seconds left, I actually had the "Cavs losing is going to be *seriously* impressive" for about half a second. And then it was done, and it was good.|Pistons|3
This game took 5 years of my life.  My heart's going to be racing for another hour at least.||13
I fear tens of thousands of Clevelander will wander the city for the next few days, in awe. God knows we have enough guns and illegal fireworks to create Nam. Everybody in Cleveland will have PTSD.||71
Just hold up, brt. Driving down from Buffalo.||2
I live in akron. Last night everyone was in tears. I don't really watch much basketball but I was fucking crying for LeBron. The city is going to be a party for at least a week.||3
I hope so. My dumas stated in last night since I had work. Half of the people I work with called in sick today. I feel like a chump, but I'm gonna drink like a champ tonight!||1

Never lost a series ||3
He was solid tonight. So many rebounds.||3
Yeah he was +19 too|Knicks|4
He had big 14 rebounds and kept them in it in the first quarter with all of those offensive rebounds.|Spurs|8
and he stepped the fuck up all jokes aside|Raptors|202
His shot wasn't great but his defense was not bad and he was all over the boards. He had a great game, they absolutely do not win this without his 16 rebounds.|Bucks|6
Love's performance will go under the radar. He played 100x better than the rest of his game this series.  He remembered he could rebound.|Celtics|10
best + - aswel, good hustle on D good rebounding, he didnt try to shoot too much, that 3/9 is just fine, that last play on curry was solid defending aswel, cuz the most important thing was not to foul him he still stayed there nicely|Raptors|3
You know, his defense on that possession will be burned into my mind. I kept thinking "He\'s gunna get crossed up, he\'s gunna get crossed up, he\'s gunna foul, oh god he\'s gunna foul." But he kept with him every step of the way. I wish we could get a streamable of that. His feet were moving so fast, hahaha|Celtics|3
Had a good game today||221
i like your response better than op's. you just ignored his banter and just replied the truth.|[HOU] James Harden|-1
In fact, with him on the court, +19. Not too bright shooting the ball but his rebounding and defense was amazing. Kudos to him!|Spain|1
I'm so happy he had a solid game and in game 7 too.|Bulls|1
LeBron won't have to yell at him today|Hornets|1
His defense and rebounding were amazing. Him making Curry take some stupid one handed three pointer at the end of the game was one of the biggest plays of the game. It will get overlooked, but his defense really helped with the win.|Pistons|2
Turns out all he needed was a Starbucks doubleshot. Did you see him in the beginning of the game lol||2
No he had a great game today, Cleveland would have been a lot more lethal if Kevin Love hadn't had his confidence shattered|Knicks|6

every other time, that matchup ended badly. But Kevin love finally got him on that play||1
My friends were giving me so much shit for buying a Love Jersey. Guess who got the last laugh|Cavaliers|1
I was shaking my head the entire time just waiting for Curry to get free for just a second and drain a 3. Love gave it his all on that one|[SAS] Tim Duncan|1
I\'m pretty new to this NBA thing and jumped on the cavs bandwagon at the start of the series (perfect time to get into this game oh man) and this whole game I\'m looking at Love thinking "this is the guy Reddit thinks is useless??"||1
totally agree. that one play alone basically redeemed him from any criticism||1
"Fuck you /r/NBA" -Kevin Love\xe2\x80\xa6 probably|[OKC] Russell Westbrook|2
Kevin Love just played rope a dope for two entire seasons all for this one single game. Successfully fooled everyone into thinking he was the weak link. GS game plan revolved around attacking him, but he finally revealed the true defensive ninja and attacked back. \n\nConspiracy Love.||2
Cavs were +17 with Love on the Court tonight. He killed it||2
Dude, that swarming, EFFORT defense by the Cavs, and specifically Love on that possession you're talking about ... that stuff is just mind-boggling to me. Team defense and swarming the ball takes such a monstrous amount of effort and restraint not to foul, I'm simply in awe of the defense the Cavs played. Another testament to the shooting prowess of Klay/Steph that they created such defensive monsters. Blanketing people past the 3 point line balls to the wall.\n\nKevin really embodied it on that possession to force Steph into such a bad look. God damn what a game.|Supersonics|2
his defense was absurd|Nuggets|3
His defense all series was pretty solid.  Never found an offensive rhythm and seemed to lose his rebounding sense until tonight, but I think a lot of things were overstated about Love.  This was a tough, tough match-up series for him and we're a team that lives or dies by LeBron...and when Kyrie *and* LeBron are hot, Love just wont touch the ball much offensively.\n\nI thought he came up big tonight, even if he only got 9 points.  Glad he got to seriously contribute in one of our wins, because he's a far better player than people gave him credit for most of this series.\n\nAlso a minor shoutout to Barnes, who is obviously far better of a player than the shit he's been getting too.  He didn't really shine today, but he's a solid cog that most teams would love to have.|[CLE] Kevin Love|15
As a ball player who's dislocated their shoulder multiple times, it can have a huge impact on your mindset and how you play defense, rebound, basically anyway your shoulder can re-dislocate. It's a challenging injury to come back from mentally and physically, and still on the grand stage i feel like Kevin Love put in decent work despite that. ||2
I was losing my mind watching Kev defend Curry at the end. I've never seen such crazy footwork. Bravo to him for showing up on the biggest stage.|Lakers|22
I kept thinking he was going to bite on one of Curry's fakes, but he stayed with him the entire play until Curry forced up a clanker. Love didn't score much, but 14 boards and all of his points seem to come in critical points where the Cavs felt like they were about to stall out offensively otherwise. And check out that +19 +/-, too!|Pacers|3
yeah man, Kev brought a lot of intangibles throughout the season and playoffs, and yes he did struggle, but man did he come thru. I always doubted their decision to trade Wiggins for him, but given that same situation I don't know if Wiggins could've done what Kev did. Sometimes the experience is key.|Lakers|2
As someone who had a concussion once, I'm pretty amazed he was able to bounce back and play at all, let alone provide key contributions in the biggest game of his career.\n\nEdit: Haha, wow, salty GSW fans must be digging deep and downvoting everything even remotely pro-Cleveland right now. Give Love some respect for playing his heart out, guys!|Pacers|3
Another thing a lot of people discounted, it's not an ACL tear, it's not a sprained ankle, but a concussion is a serious injury, it's just not visible and people forget about it. The way he came back from that and did his part is amazing. Lot of respect for him.|Lakers|3
Having watched him in Minnesota for his whole career I was shocked with that defense.  Like he was a completely different guy.|Timberwolves|8
that defensive play + offensive boards in the 1st quarter. dude was a monster and helped the cavs stay in it early on when GSW was knocking down 3s|Cavaliers Bandwagon|166
i was really surprised the Cavs were able to stick with the Ws in the first half with the Dubs hitting 10 3s.||1
That fucking one-handed rebound!||7
That was my favorite! I think that was his 4th rebound and it was still pretty early in the game but that was evidence that he was going to do all he could on the boards tonight|[SAS] Tim Duncan|6
Kevin Love was locked in. He had every part of his body in this game, in every moment, every split second. I felt his intensity through the screen. |Spurs|818
more like *locked up* \n\nafter the first 5 minutes love was double teamed for the remainder of the game ||1
My fave love moment was when he fought his own teammate for one of the rebounds. That's when I knew he wasn't fucking around tonight.||1
I saw that too! Thats when I knew that he was locked in 100% not just 99%. And also when he passed up a partially contested three to pass it to lebron, then got in the post calling for the ball so he could score with muscle. He was ready to pound! \n\nI remember he had a turnover passing out of a double team, which makes me so impressed because despite that, it didnt phase him. Same infensity. Like.. Ok ok a turnover. Whoops. Next play now. Lets do it. Defense. |Spurs|1
KNOW YOUR ROLE|Nuggets|1
He really manned up on the boards tonight, really controlled the glass|Mavericks|1
He also got a damn good amount of rebounds this game, and more than two points.||1
I'm 22 hours late, but that's his think.  When he focuses and truly dedicates himself to a possession, he's top 10 in the league.  But most of the time he is just spacing out and lacking intensity.  Hopefully this Chip is a confidence boost for Kev, I want so badly for him to become a beast.|Cavaliers|2
You could see it from that first possession he had where he missed two bunnies and things seemed like they were going to go very bad for Love, but then he ripped the rebound away from ezeli and layed it in. Dude was not going to lose this game.|[NYK] Kristaps Porzingis|2
And thats partially credit to lebrons leadership too i think. The passion of not goving up when down 3-1 not until the end of the last buzzer, that passion carrying into a very winnable game 7. \n\nIm glad that game 7 K Love exists. |Spurs|2

Because that's got to be the lamest attempt at clowning on her I've ever seen.|Nuggets|2
What'd she ask?  I missed it||5
I don\'t know the exact question but she asked the Cavs owner something like "Two years ago youwrote a letter shaming Lebron...." and Gilbert said "sorry I didn\'t hear all of your question but I\'d love to give a shout out to this team and city...." he basically played it off.||78
She didn\'t directly reference the letter, what she said was more along the lines of "after Lebron left and all the buzz around that, could you ever imagine him coming back and you guys winning the title like this?"\n\nObviously throwing a little bit of a glance at the letter but it wasn\'t quite so blatant.|Lakers|3
it was a lot longer than 2 years ago|Cavaliers|12
Boss answer to that question. I love how Doris talks about her struggle to compete in her career just to ask that question. Let the man celebrate.||26

> James has a Cleveland franchise, his hometown team, one win away from a championship -- one win away from the greatest comeback in NBA Finals history, one win away from upending an opponent that hungers to be known as the greatest ever. Win one game, you win everything. The Cavaliers have never been this close. It is not hyperbole to suggest every step in James\' basketball journey has led to this moment.\n\n> Win Sunday in Oakland, and the dumb, overheated debate about James\' "legacy" disappears from the airwaves forever. There will be no more convenient cherry-picking of his few subpar Big Moment games, no more selective memory to buttress preconceived damnation, no more talk about his emotional fortitude from people who have never had a conversation with him.\n\n> Every NBA Finals carries legacy weight. Every Game 7 lingers somewhere in our memory forever. But this? This is enormous. This is a flashbulb game. This is as big as sports gets.\n\n-Zach Lowe|NBA|1076
I love Zach, but the LeBron hate isn't going away.|Celtics|-3
Nope. For me he is a victim of circumstance. I will never believe the East was good enough to force him to play his hardest. He basically needs to win 4 games to win a championship. The Cavs steamrolled pretty much every team. The Raptors got 2 lucky wins. You gonna tell me that this Cavs team is better than Lebron, Wade, and Bosh. The Heat had the Celtics to get through. Who did the Cavs have? They won the title, Congrats i guess.|Lakers|-7
They had the team with the most wins in NBA history. That little thing.|Kings|1
Yeah. And the Cavs had a damn near rested team. Everyone healthy for the most part. Injured Bogut, beat up Iggy. It was 3-1 and Dray gets suspended for what is basically a Phantom punch. Like I said, it's over, Cavs are the Champs. Steph didn't show out. /r/NBA can go back to their LeBron hard on. The Cavs lost 2 games to the Raptors. You don't think Portlands backcourt would have torched them worse. You think they would have beat the Thunder in 6 games. I just hope some more Superstar players go over to the East and make it a respectable conference. |Lakers|-1
I think the East is solid, but all the players capable of defending Lebron are either in the West, like Leonard, or have a lackluster team around them, like George.|NBA|1
If only George could get 2 All-Stars to play with him. We root for the Warriors cause they came up together. No hype for any of them. That first Finals LeBron took the Cavs to was crazy. He had no one. I liked that LeBron. Then he sold out to Miami. Did his stupid speech, not 5, 6, 7, which will always loom over him. Then jumps to Cleveland and basically says I need another marquee player or we don't have a shot. |Lakers|-1
I think you raise a good point.  It's a lot more fun to watch a team grow up together.  Even though it's a business, it's just more fun when it doesn't feel like a business.\n\nTo be fair to Lebron, you have to have more than one great player to win a title.  Look at Kobe.  Once Shaq left, those Lakers were awful.  Then the Pau Gasol deal happens, and they have a team capable of winning titles again.|NBA|1
It's mostly true. I will rebutt that with the 04 Pistons, 2011 Mavs, and the Warriors last year. Even the Spurs. All these teams are one solid unit. Everyone plays their role. LeBron is a Great player that has needed at least 2 other really great players to be successful. IMO he just looked for the easy road to a ring and he got 3 of them. |Lakers|0

My bad, should have linked it last night. ESPN makes it so hard to find an article by a specific writer. Like, if you click on their name you just get their bio or twitter page or something... not a list of their articles like Grantland used to do.|NBA|3
Yeah no doubt. ESPN's website is awful. I had to copy and paste that entire excerpt and look for like article for a bit after that to even find it. Thanks for sharing it!|Cavaliers|3
Interesting paragraph \n\n>If the Warriors lose Game 7 on Sunday in Oakland, Green and his teammates will have to absorb the very real possibility that his temper cost them a championship.\n\nBut nope, he made up for it by having an insane game 7 and now Steph and Klay shoulder that blame almost completely in the eyes of most fans, it seems|Celtics|13
I still think Green is shouldering a lot of internal blame on himself right now. If he is there for Game 5 this could've been a much different series all around. He played like a madman last night though. I don't like him for his temper and how he seeminglygets away with murder on the court, but I will admit he gave 200% last night and it sucked to see that effort go to waste.\n\nSteph and Klay blew it no doubt. But I think we did a a lot as a team to limit their effectiveness. Either way, a Unanimous MVP should've performed better. Still a great series and game. Can't wait to see The Land defend the title next season.|Cavaliers|8

Incredibly eloquent.|Cavaliers|25
Lowe is the best NBA writer out there. Absolutely incredible article. Can't wait to see if he writes one after this game.|Bucks|63
And he was spot on. Lebron is now squarely on the level of the very greatest legends in NBA history. Jordan, Russell, Bird, Magic, Lebron, etc. will be what people say 15 years from now when they start rattling off all-time greats. \n\nLiterally everything he has ever done as a basketball player was hanging in the balance during that game. A loss could have signaled the end of his era and the cementing of Curry's. And there's a good chance that without another title he would have been defined as a brilliant player who could not get it done in the clutch, who more often than not failed on the biggest stage. \n\nAll of that is dead now. He was a god among men, literally superhuman in that series. I have never seen anything like it. His legacy is set in stone.||40
Lebron can never win another championship and he will still go down as top 5|Vancouver Grizzlies|2
I'm so glad the nitpicking can stop. However, I wish there was another way|Warriors|16
Me too, believe me. I loved both teams in the Finals and it's exciting and hurts. I feel so bad for the Warriors and all the shit they're about to get. Stephen A Smith already started on Curry last night. It'll be a tough few months, years, whatever for the Warriors.... depending on their future success of course.|NBA|2

Basically golden state beat the bulls for the best ever record in a regular season going 73-9 but unlike the bulls they never won the championship aka a ring (winning players get a ring for winning the finals). The joke is that 73-9 is good but 72-10 has a ring (championship victory) to it.|Heat|15

Know what I find interesting here? The benches. You watch that 2nd replay angle, and you see the Cavs bench at the other end of the floor. And no one is sitting. Everyone is up, supporting. You see one of the players and a few assistant coaches leap into the air when LeBron goes up for the dunk. Then he's fouled, and he comes crashing to the floor. You see the Golden State bench. Some of them are leaning backwards in their chairs. Arms crossed. Not really looking engaged with what's going on in front of them. |Cavaliers|3
Thats all I could think about. If he landed that one hand dunk with 10 seconds left to go up by 5 it would have been on every poster and magazine cover.||7

It's worse imo. 18-1 fucking sucked (I'm a Pats fan) but football always comes down to one game, and any given Sunday is a thing. Basketball is a series. You have to be consistent for 4 games to clinch it. The 73-9 Warriors proved that they really couldn't deliver when it mattered, when at 3-1 up they had 3 chances to win 1 game. \n\nHave the 2007 Patriots play those Giants for 7 games and I feel pretty confident that they manage to win 4.

I still can't believe that the first team to blow a 3-1 lead in the finals was the best regular season team of all time. Don't mean a thing without the ring.|[BOS] Shavlik Randolph|853
did win a ring last year though lol|[GSW] Draymond Green|1
Best record for a regular season team... there are five teams with much better point differentials, which is a better indicator of how good a team actually is.  And most of those teams were better by a mile (i.e. more than 1.5 points per game).\n\nNone of this is to say this isn't a massive upset or that Golden State wasn't a great team.||1
Meh, it makes sense when you realize LeBron played the best finals series in NBA history. By FAR.||1
As a boston fan you would know...||1
Warriors put all their eggs into the season record basket, were too fatigued to get the rings.  ||1
Now there's a tune I can dance to!||1
Exactly, who in history is actually going to give a fuck about their regular season perfection except for die hard stats man that need something to talk about 20 years from now.||1
Hey man, as a die hard Bulls fan that record is something of glory. Also, statisticians are the rawest fans of the game. You sound like a casual fan.|Bulls|1
It will get brought up any time a team comes close to breaking it. Also whenever anybody brings up historic championship upsets/comebacks.|Rockets|1
Well it means you're the best regular season team of all times that lost to the greatest player of all times that one time. ||2
Best regular season team pales in comparison to best team of all time which still belongs to the bulls after tonights loss|Suns|1
Can we all just agree this was a fantastic series and one of the best game 7s in recent memory?|Supersonics|9
Apparently no||1
We sure can and the Cavs showed why they are better. And why regular season doesn't mean a thing. Best finals game ever. Their bullshit front runner fans are hating right now. This would have happened last year if love and Kyrie were healthy. |Cavaliers|1
For real that was insane. I'm physically exhausted |Celtics|2
I think it was the best game 7 period. I still thought the game 6 v SAS was crazier, but this was the beat game 7||5
Oh I agree, my man... but you gotta let us blow off some steam and enjoy the moment, you know what I mean? Don't be a spoilsport politically-correct diplomatic dude right now, aight? Cavs fans endured all kinds of shit, and the Warriors fans were all cocky as shit with their all-time 73-9 regular season record, ya know?|Spurs|3

I think this was a storybook ending designed specifically for Lebron's career:\n\n1. Playing for home town Cleveland after spurning it and then returning\n\n2. Against a 73-9 all time best regular season team\n\n3. On the road at enemy's homecourt\n\n4. Down 3-1 in Finals from which no team has ever come back to win\n\nand finally\n\nTo end championship drought in Cleve- at least we're not Detroit -land||17
Yeah, Detroit has 3 NBA championships, 4 World Series, and 11 Stanley Cups... plus a shitty football team that never went to Baltimore.||1
The cherry on top would have been if he made that dunk at the end. That would have been beautiful. I'm not even a huge nba fan and tuned in to watch the last couple of finals games. That dunk would have been a thing of beauty.||12
No, its way better how it actually happened! I mean, think about it:\n\nHe's going for the monster, game-sealing dunk when a clean foul takes him down. He lands hard on his shooting hand, gripping his wrist in pain. His teammates and his city, shocked, fall silent. \n\nHe eventually gets up and heads to the free-throw linel, his shooting wrist clearly an issue. The first shot rattles out - it's still a one-possession game, still easy for the Warriors to tie it up. \n\nHe prepares for his second shot. One chance to make it a two-possession game. Without this shot, the game is a toss-up. With it, victory is a heartbeat away. The weight of 52 years of heartbreak, and that of history, is upon his weary shoulders. \n\nHe takes a breath, dribbles the ball, cocks the ball back with his shooting hand hinged on his throbbing wrist, and sends the ball towards the basket. Half a country away, an entire city holds its breath.\n\nTime seems to slow down as the ball arcs through the air. \n\n*Swish.*\n\n||7
I agree.  That second free throw was probably the most nerve wracking shot of his career.||1
That's better as a story or documentary, but when you're watching the game, I wanted to see him monster dunk some bitches. \n\nCan you imagine the posters? The video game covers? That dunk would have been cemented in everyone's mind for the following years. ||1
Except in reality: *back iron*, *front iron*, barely sneaks in a free throw on a gimp wrist. Even better.||6

As much as people hate Draymond, he did as much as he could to try and win GS a finals. Curry and Klay just went cold, and Barnes stopped being able to shoot at the worst moment.|Spurs|1005
Don't forget Kerr constantly putting Varajeo and Ezili so the warriors could lose the lead they built with a small line up. \n\n|Knicks|2
No fucking doubt! He played out of his mind tonight. He's a passionate guy and loves the game. It's going to rub some people wrong and I get it to some extent but so happy to have him in the NBA. ||2

As a Cavs fan and a guy angry at Green, his effort and game tonight was impressive. Deserves respect.||9
Draymond was the best player on the floor in Game 7 and was the only reason the Warriors were even competitive.|Celtics|16
I'm pretty sure Lebron was the best player in the floor in game 7.||1
Best player on the Warriors, prob|Spurs|1
No I believe Draymond was better than LeBron in game seven. See other comment.|Celtics|4
No, by almost any metric Draymond was better than LeBron in game seven. \n\nA line of 11/15 with 32 points, 15 rebounds, and 9 assists with excellent defense is better than 9/24 with 27 points, 11 rebounds, and 11 assists with excellent defense.\n\nThe difference is that Draymond's teammates choked and LeBron's didn't. LeBron was for sure better in the series as a whole but Draymond was better in game seven.|Celtics|9
I don't know about that one. Draymond benefits a great deal from klay and steph being focal points of the defense. Look how many uncontested shots draymond had. Lebron was never alone. In fact he got his numbers even though he was the main focus for the Warriors defense. ||2
Absolutely. The Warriors had a ten-to-one 3-point advantage in the first half but only lead by 4. If Draymond hadn't have balled out of his mind, this would have been a blowout victory for the Cavs.|Bucks|3
Draymond earned something back on the court tonight.\n\nHowever, the narrative will be that GS should have closed it out in Game 5 with Draymond on the court.\n\nThat's gonna haunt him.|Hornets|11
Draymond was on fire this game and nearly carried this Warriors team to victory.\n\n\nI dunno if Curry's injury is as bad as the rumors say but him, Klay, and Barnes didn't step up when the Warriors needed them to.|Lakers|148
Yeah I think stephs hurt - he was throwing up some BRICKS||1
Fuck this injury bullshit. Period. |[WAS] John Wall|1
I know it's easy to say in hindsight but the injury had to have been affecting him. \n\nThere was no reason to believe he would fall off a cliff, and it just so happens to be right after he misses games due to injury. It's gonna sound like excuses and all that jazz, but I just don't see how he could play this bad if he was healthy. He played great for 82 games and then just.....  |[GSW] Festus Ezeli|0
For real talk though you didn't need to be a basketball analyst to see that the Curry in this series wasn't the same guy in the regular season; he was missing easy layups and open shots that he would make easily.\n\n\n\nWhether or not it's actually due to injury or it's something mental we cannot get the truth until the off-season where we will find out if Curry will have surgery for anything.|Lakers|2
Incoming fake surgery by Curry\n\njk guys ;)|Lakers|2
> I dunno if Curry's injury is as bad as the rumors say but him\n\nLMAO every time the Warriors lose this excuse comes out. But when they win no one says anything about an injury|Clippers|4
[deleted]||-8
He's shitting on fans acting like a slightly rolled ankle is an injury|Hornets|2
Damn, no need to be bitter. I'm a bandwagon fan, look at the flair. I'm not shitting on the Warriors but it's obnoxious that every time the Warriors lose the excuse is he is hurt rather than he just didn't play well.|Clippers|3
>But when they win no one says anything about an injury\n\nLet\'s be honest why would they? If Lebron had a fever and had an amazing game no one would bat an eye and say stuff like "Lebron so good he\'s beating the fever like MJ" but if he lost people would say "oh Lebron was playing sick so of course he wouldn\'t do as well".\n\n\nIt\'s just a common response to these type of situations that isn\'t fanbase specific at all.|Lakers|17
...except that he isn\'t hurt? If LeBron had a fever, win or lose people would say "wow he had a fever". The issue is that this entire series while GS was winning, NO ONE mentioned this "injury". Now that they lost game 7...Oh now it\'s an injury that made it happen. Same thing happened vs OKC. |Clippers|0
>...except that he isn\'t hurt?\n\nWe don\'t know the details so I\'m going to give the benefit of the doubt that Curry has something wrong considering he didn\'t look anything even close to the same guy from the regular season.\n\n\n>NO ONE mentioned this "injury".\n\nOkay we\'re back at square one because I already provided my response to this and I cannot fully understand what you\'re trying to say. Can you reword it? |Lakers|7
He literally just said in his press conference "I\'m not injured, there will be no surgery, I have no excuses for how I played on the floor".\n\nBut please, keep on trying to argue lmao|Clippers|-9
Come on man. If he came out and told the truth, which is that he has two nagging injuries, people like you would be like, "Oh, bullshit excuses!"||2
>He literally just said in his press conference "I\'m not injured, there will be no surgery, I have no excuses for how I played on the floor".\n\nI wasn\'t aware of that since I normally don\'t watch press conferences so my bad.\n\n\n>But please, keep on trying to argue lmao\n\nYou didn\'t have to be a douche about it though.|Lakers|7
Intereating, I assumed he HAD to be injured. Those shots he was missing were completely unexplainable. ||1
I don't think he is injured to be honest. Not sure what it is though, but he did lose his swagger after the ankle/knee injuries. Now thats all on him though.||10
Dray having the best game of his life makes the Cavs win even better.  |Rockets|1875
I remember green falling to the ground and just kicking his leg in the air when LeBron went down. Green needs to chill.||2
Draymond's first half was incredible, but he had an average second half which obviously didn't get it done.||2
Imagine if LeBron got that dunk though...|Suns|2
There is a god||2
Mmm you're absolutely right|[SAS] Manu Ginobili|2
He had that game against Portland this playoffs (Curry out) where he couldn't miss from 3... the Dubs lost that one also.\n\nWhen Green is their leading scorer I'd guess that usually means the Splash Brothers didn't show up.||2
This makes me so happy|Cavaliers|9
I'm so happy too. Fuck the Warriors!!!!|Rockets|13

To be fair, he played pretty clean tonight.  Plus seeing him out there giving congrats to Lebron gave me a little respect for him.\n\nA little.\n\nA very little.||15
He was doing everything he could to win. Not only this game but all series long. Lebron was also they just have different ways of going about it.||6

If he would've only gotten kicked in the balls on the final play...|76ers|60
Just rolling around the hardwood, in searing pain, while the buzzer sounds and the Cavaliers storm the court all around him. ||3
I honestly thought he kicked Lebron in the nuts on the last ridiculous dunk attempt lol|Lakers|9
I knew I wasn't the only one||2
Agreed, it would have been a walkover without him. Such a great performance for Dray|[OKC] Steven Adams|20
He showed up and eclipsed everyone in scoring and barely missed a triple double. Plus he gained some respect back by making a point of waiting to congratulate LeBron. He made tonight close, otherwise this would have been a boring ass blowout we turn off. ||5
He almost won it with one of his threes too||1
Curry was pretty bad as far as MVP standards go the whole series. |Spurs|371
I've seen rumblings he was playing injured but I am sure everyone was banged up somewhat. ||1
He kept making bad moves, the last thing to do is go for 3s at 10 seconds left||1
The MVP award is technically the Best Person Not Named Lebron award.||2
Pretty bad is an understatement. I would say he was on lockdown considering the numbers we were used to seeing from him and what he was putting up. I believe the stat was that he had the lowest combined score for the first 3 games of the finals for an MVP by like 40 points. After that, I don't know actual numbers but he continued to get shut down|[CLE] LeBron James|2
His performance over the two finals has been solid, but nothing special. Most of that may be just how truly amazing he is comparatively in the regular season, but I haven't been overly impressed by his games in the Finals these past two seasons. ||2
something something hockey assist|[HOU] Tracy McGrady|2
Curry couldn't sink a shit in the toilet right now.  Completely fell off.||8
He had a lot of great shots and that defensive play to force a turnover that he then scored was also epic.\n||1
What a weird time for him right now. To go from predicted as a solid 6th man in the draft, to an injury riddled early career, to 3 years ago where he wasn't considered a top 5 pg in the league in this sub (behind Rubio) because of his injuries and lack of defense, to a championship where everyone still insults you for coasting, to a season that really was epic as fuck because of a work ethic that Luke Walton said could only compare to Kobe, to getting compared to GOATs for one solid all-time great season (which earned him the majority of the hate even though its not like he made up the narrative, thats on ESPN), to being talked about as the new face of the NBA over LeBron (whose been hyped since he was 18 as opposed to Curry whose been hyped for a year), to now the butt of every joke everywhere. Bizarre. I love basketball, but I wouldn't wish the scrutiny that comes with it on my worst enemy.|Lakers|2
The only impressive shot was the one off Tristan Thompson, other than that really poor.|Celtics|2
Seriously, that's consecutive Finals where he didn't really show up, as the reigning regular season MVP. I'm not sure he would have been FMVP this year even if the Warriors won.|Pistons|6
LeBron would have been finals MVP even if they lost. There's no way he wouldn't have been.|[HOU] Hakeem Olajuwon|1
Maybe Klay? Nobody stood out consistently on the Warriors|Hornets|1
LOL, none of the two would've won it. It would've been either Iggy or Draymond. More the latter because he was 1 assist shy of a triple double. Steph and Klay kept missing shots that was like a walk in the park all season long, to not remember dumb shooting decisions by the MVP when it wasnt needed |Celtics|2
That's only considering game 7. Klay was pretty beast most of the series.|[CHA] Kemba Walker|5
No doubt Klay played good throughout the series but imo an MVP should be awarded to the player who's consistent all the way, he disappeared during the big moments which led to him losing it.|Celtics|1
Even if the Warriors won I think Lebron should of gotten it. If they had to pick a guy on the Warriors I think Draymond would be the only choice even with missing a game.\n\nKind of like how I felt Peyton proved he was MVP when he was out with his neck and Colts couldn't win a game.||5
Turrible||21
That behind the back turnover in crunch time was pretty cringey|Mavericks|198
That's a move he might regret for a long time|Bulls|1
A long time||2
There were *so fucking many* of those this series. They never put it together that the flashy shit that works against cellar-dwellers during the regular season isn't going to fly against a team with the Championship on the line. Cleveland defense was remarkable this series. After Game 2 I thought it would be a cakewalk, but they turned it up. They deserve this win. ||2

I just stopped breathing when I saw he was going to take the shot. Ice cold killer.|Knicks|1
What a crazy shot. |[CLE] Kyrie Irving|1
This game has, and will always be, about buckets.|76ers|1
That's the only player from the Cavaliers I have respect for. I'm glad Irving gets a ring, other than that, I don't care.||1
He better get MVP||1
Coming in clutch as always||1
The man went super saiyan|Raptors|1
And the fucking balls to take that shot, on the dribble contested 3. ||2
MR FOURTH QUARTER!!!|Cavaliers|2
Fun fact: the Great Balls of Kyrie Irving join the Great Wall of China as visible from space.|Timberwolves|2
Irving carried the team, good job man!! \n||2
I was like "that\'s the best Lue could come up with out of the TO??" But then Kyrie silenced me. |Hornets|2
*Looks around at the team* "Get Kyrie the ball and get the fuck out the way," .....championship.|Rockets|2
UNCLE FUCKING DREWWWWW!!!!!!!!!|NBA|2
ironically, going into the TO my dad said "they need to give the ball to kyrie, hes the best for 1-1 situations" and my mom (doesnt know shit) said "yeah right"|Heat|3
He straight up looked like Kobe. The slight fade, the leg...fucking drained it. Fuck you defense. That\'s a "fuck you, this is my championship" shot.|Knicks|3
The duo does remind me a bit of Shaq and Kobe, especially the 6-7 year age difference as opposed to both being in their prime.|Lakers|1
That shot was amazing. Kyrie the stone cold killer|Kings|5
He won this game for them.. unbelievable||2718
He won it, but fucking JR Smith kept them in the game early. They were getting some pretty clutch play from everyone at different parts of the game.||1
Plus, bron's championship winning block on Iggy.||1
Uncle Drawn.|NBA|1
I'd say Steph lost it as much as Kyrie won it, but regardless, congrats to Cavs fans. ||1
He really wanted that ring |Bulls|1
I don't know why that's getting so overlooked. He hit the game winner.|Timberwolves|1
no. lebron did. but that shot was fucking clutch.|[HOU] Moochie Norris|1
When curry couldn't, anything that happened in the other 46 minutes didn't matter and anyone couldve been a hero and it was kyrie|Warriors|2
That Lebron block on the layup probably won them the game. GS couldn't score anything after that.||2
Three golds, back to back. Nice. Also who woulda thought Dray was going to play that well. |Rockets|2
I can't believe after a crazy season by Steph Curry that the NBA finals would result in Kyrie Irving > Steph Curry.|Lakers|3
Draymond almost won it for GS, holy fuck I think he made more threes than da splash bros|Cavaliers|6
he won the series for them ||4
Man, all of the big 3 stepped up. Kyrie hit that 3. Kev with the GREAT defense on Curry, and LBJ sacrificing his body to put it out of reach.\n\nIm crying rn!|Cavaliers|6
Lebron's absolute monster of a block put them in that position.|Nuggets|4
Lebron with the exclamation point non-dunk. If you needed a metaphor...|Braves|27
I saw it as an exclamation point coming on the 1 made free throw with a jammed up wrist\n\nIf LeBron made that dunk it'd be a Top 5 all time NBA finals moment   |[NYK] J.R. Smith|2
yeah, true. some champagna on ice might help the pain|Braves|1
If he had posterized Draymond it would have been the perfect ending to the postseason.||1
LeBron won the series|Cavaliers|1708
No, he didn't. As usual, he was second fiddle. Kyrie was the best player on the Cavs. |Bucks|-25
bro you're a troll. enjoy the magnificence that is going to be the King James celebration this next 6 months. I'm sure you'll be doubling down on the hating.\n\nWe'll all be laughing at you, btw.|Cavaliers|5
Wut|Timberwolves|13
Dywane Wade won Miami their titles, and Kyrie was the reason Cleveland won this time. I'm sorry if you didn't actually watch. |Bucks|-15
Wade is my favorite player but he did *not* win us those 2 titles. |Heat|5
and we all won a free doritos locos taco||1
That block was the game. ||1
Do we get another taco?|[DAL] Jamal Mashburn|1
Technically there were 3 road games won|Cavaliers|1
LeBron won Game 7 just as much as Kyrie if not more. Six consecutive points killed all GS's momentum. Then the block.|Suns|1
The Cavaliers won the series. One man doesn't win championships.|Raptors|2
That lebron block at the end of the game was just ruthless. He's completely about that life. ||2
this is the real definition of a player literally putting not just the team, but the entire city on his back. |Hawks|2
And we all won a free Doritos Locos taco redeemable at participating Taco Bell franchises between 2 and 6 pm on June 21st!|[SAS] Tim Duncan|2
And we all won a free taco on tuesday!|Warriors|3
He's clearly the MVP of the series, but he was killing the offense the last 4 minutes. Kyrie took a possession for himself and won the game. That was a legacy-making play for Kyrie.|Bulls|3
Both of them carried that team. Obviously LeBron more.|Suns|3
I mean, Lebron led the charge, Kyrie was that missing piece that made Lebron lose those finals early in his career. Kyrie is a fucking stud, AND HE'S STILL FUCKING DEVELOPING. HE'S 24 FOR FUCKS SAKE.\n\nKyrie was off those first 2 games, and I still think he had a black eye for them as you can find in my post history. His midrange was off and it looked like depth perception was the problem. He had good games regardless.\n\nBUT IT ACTUALLY FUCKING HAPPENED. CLEVELAND WON!!! FUCK INDIVIDUAL CREDIT. CLEVELAND WON!!!|Cavaliers|3
Yes he definitely did, but kyrie won that game. ||978
[deleted]||1
They're Duke fans||1
So torn on who should be MVP\n\nKyrie just (literally) lit a fucking fire that game\n\n\nBy that I mean downtown is probably on fire...|Cavaliers|2
They were pretty even as far as the scoring is concerned. Taking assists, steals, rebounds, blocks, defense into account, i don't see how it's not Lebron. He was huge.||3
He was just named, from what I saw.  But you can't deny that Kyrie's fucking spectacular acrobatics kept them in the game.  Points wise and moral wise...\n\nOfc...LeBron kept them in the series, lol.|Cavaliers|2
Yeah no way they come back from 3-1 without Kyrie's incredible offense. Dude became big time in my eyes this series.||2
Cleveland really deserves this. (imo)  LeBron does too.\n\nKyrie earned it imo...|Cavaliers|2
He hit some big shots. There's more to basketball. Lebrons defense mainly and also subtle things you can't see unless you're looking.||2
Kyrie won both these crucial games in Oakland. Phenomenal performances. |NBA|3
Dude was Focused all game. No celebrating just straight hustlin|Rockets|3
tripple double, amzing defense all game, and that HUGE block on a breakaway.|Bulls|5
The Lebron-Kyrie duo has been ridiculous over the last 3 games. James alone has easily the best 3-game stretch of any player in the finals, but that duo is so far above the next best over that stretch it's unbelievable. ||3
Agreed. LeBron, just like every other GoaT, can't do it alone, and holy cow did kyrie step up when he needed to|NBA|5
He won game 7 and game 5. Cleveland owes him a few brews|76ers|5
He did have a LeBron game. 27-11-11. Amazing from both players|Cavaliers|9
Lebron has a triple double ||32
I feel like people are trying so hard to be contrarian in this thread lol.  LeBron was clearly MVP of this game and the series|Bucks|1
Plus he made way for a lot of plays|Clippers|3
Assists will do that|Hawks|1
have u not heard? 26 > 27, 6 > 11, 1 > 11.|Raptors|4
Found the mathematician!||4
No ignore that. KYRIE WON IT YOU PLEB|Heat|24
Hear me out guys....but is it possible they both won the game?|Jazz|480
Nahhhh.... according to a majority of redditors, Kyrie is mediocre and LeBron doesn't deserve to be cocky about his abilities|[CLE] LeBron James|1
No because all the points that were scored before that 3 don't really count... technically the final score was 3-0.|Pelicans|1
As a... team?||1
Yeah Lebron was dirt nasty you guys! Uncle Drew was clutch af too but come on now|[POR] Damian Lillard|1
Are people forgetting LeBron's six consecutive points? Killed all GS's momentum. Then the block.|Suns|3
They both won the series.  ||4
I need things simple. Tell me who won the fucking game.||6
Uhhh....  Uhhh....  Anderson varejao? |[OKC] Ray Allen|2
My sources tell me they were on the same team, so it's not absurd to think they worked together to win the game. That's pure speculation though, so don't quote me on it.|Bulls|116
Top Kek||3
Big if true.|Thunder|3
Big if true|Lakers|3
You and your 'sources', man. You're just finding Twitter trolls who say this shit, I know it!|Celtics|3
> My sources tell me they were on the same team, so it's not absurd to think they worked together to win the game. \n\n||3
You sick son of a bitch. Never could follow the rules, eh facepalminghomer? |Bulls|1
-NikolaTwain|Thunder|3
Care to divulge those *sources*?  I call bullshit.||3
A good reporter never gives up the source. [You'll never get what you want from mel!!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnNyN_UvcYM)|Bulls|3
Rumors coming in that all players on the court effected the outcome of this game, will continue to update|Kings|6
and I won a free tube of cookie dough at the state fair when I was 8. \n\nSo in a way, we're all champions. |Timberwolves|1940
And free tacos on the 25th :D|Celtics|1
What did you do with the cookie dough?||2
Witness||3
The state fair has cookie dough prizes? ...Nebraska? Iowa?||3
Minnesota state fair, the best fair|Timberwolves|8
You're the hero we deserve|Raptors|3
Hey i'm your cousin can I have a cookie?|Cavaliers|3
Yeah like he actually took the time to cook those cookies instead of eating that dough straight out the tube.|Celtics|3
Hey its him, ur cousin|[BOS] Ray Allen|4
He wants to go bowling|[DAL] Dirk Nowitzki|5
Sweet Martha's? |Timberwolves|10
Raw cookie dough can give you Salmonella.  Be careful 8 year old you.|Mark Madsen|50
Yeah but fuck it. |Rockets|1
Shit. Be careful 26 year old me. ||1
Only if you're a giant pussy.|[LAL] Kobe Bryant|3
But it's soooo good|Timberwolves|3
I've been eating raw cookie dough for 29 years, sonny. ||4
How's did the salmonella taste? |NBA|1
Exquisite.||1
I had salmonella last summer and it was fucking terrible. Worst I've felt in my entire 29 years.  Not even another bout with it could break my smile right now. |[CLE] Kyrie Irving|6
Did you lose a lot of weight? Maybe i need to get salmonella... :( \nScrew these clever usernames and flair. I am gonna go buy a bike and pedal across the country in search of peace and love. All this negative energy I've been burning during the playoffs is a waste. Thanks streetchemist, you have made a positive man of me. ||1
It ain't worth it man. Trust me. |[CLE] Kyrie Irving|3
Upvoted for visibility.|Pistons|32
Cookie dough danger awarness. I have learned something today|Thunder Bandwagon|6
Don't fucking learn that lesson. It's just scare tactics like how all your Halloween candy is full of poison and razorblades. I've been eating raw cookie dough (the kind I make with raw eggs) for decades. |NBA|1
Diarrhea is worth raw cookie dough imo|Supersonics|11
Iunno, that block by Lebron was clutch as fuck too.||1061
Haven't seen the game yet but let me guess.. He blocked someone from behind?|Bulls|1
Yeah, was gnarly. \n\nSpoiler alert.\n\nhttps://streamable.com/kp39||2
LOL so predictable. Perhaps Nike forbids him to try to block athletic players in a face to face matchup to prevent posterization.|Bulls|-2
That block was absolutely the dagger. The three was the bullet in the chamber, and the block pulled the trigger and killed golden states dream. |Raptors|2
It was Kyrie dude|Mavericks|2
That block was fucking savage. One for the god damn books.||2
Best play in the game 7.|Lakers|2
LEBRON IS THE UNANIMOUS FINALS MVP!!!!|Knicks|2
And scary as fuck too|Celtics|2
That block.|Spurs|2
Love's D on Curry on his last posession was high on the clutch meter.|Celtics|3
Not gonna take anything away from Kyrie's gamewinner, it was beautiful, but I'm with you - that block is a contender for best play ever made on a court. Ever.|Celtics|3
Yep.||3
Lebron had a bunch of amazing blocks down the stretch; what an absolute madman he is.|Lakers|4
His iso possessions in the 4th were shit, kyrie saved em. Even his run earlier in the game saved em||7
I lost my fucking shit at that block. This game was fucking intense. As you can tell I am still full of fucking adrenaline.|Nets|12
Every fan of any team is. I'm shaking typing this. |[HOU] Hakeem Olajuwon|3
That block won them the game imo. Killed momentum|Kings|357
That ball got so scared after that block! That it decided never to go back in that hoop ever again. |[LAL] Kobe Bryant|1
I agree with you that it won the game, but there was no momentum to be killed. The game was tied 89-89 for minutes|Cavaliers|1
I guess it canceled out that momentum shifting 3 point foul on dray and bad turnovers. Im so happy for Kyrie|Lakers|1
People keep saying that. There was no momentum for either team at that point. It was a punch for punch slow and prodding game right then.||2
The block + nearly putting dray on a poster + FT + fucking up their called set after the just FT. |Timberwolves|2
The Cavaliers won them the game. Totally scored more points than the Warriors.|[SAC] Ben McLemore|3
2 on 1 fast break and LeBron comes out of nowhere and insists on destroying the play. Talk about effort winning the game for your team. Incredible. ||4
That dunk would have been murder.|Heat|12
Don\'t know much about the nba2k games, but after that dunk missed, I turned to my brother and said, "That would have been the next cover for the game." \n\nThat would have been such an epic ending to the game.||1
I almost came tbh|[NYK] Latrell Sprewell|4
I can only imagine. Murdering Green for the win of Game 7 Finals. Just think of the 30 for 30 in a few years if that went down.|Kings|9
Did you see how flustered the warriors got after?  What a game!|Raptors|13
There's nothing better than watching the best lose |[HOU] Hakeem Olajuwon|-1
ALLEGEDLY|Cavaliers|3
The best won tonight.|Nuggets|22
The best individual player sure|Suns|1
Fucking LeBron, dude|Spurs|2
I'd argue that clutch as fuck defense by Love on STEPH in the final moments clinched it! So nasty!|Cavaliers|22
It's almost like they are a team or something.... Weird...||3
Maybe you should point out that they probably practice together, too.|Wizards|2
a ton of great defensive plays down the stretch. absolutely amazing|Kings|4
I was surprised by how well he managed to stay in front of him! I was so afraid of Curry blowing by Love or doing a step-back 3 but Love did really well|Vancouver Grizzlies|11
Fortunately Curry only wanted the three at the time. Otherwise, it may not have panned out as well.||8
Very true||1
Yeah he said in the press conference he should've gone by him but he was looking for the three and couldn't get enough space |Nets|2
But, you know, LeBrons triple double didn't hurt. ||202
Turns out some of those first quarter buckets counted, too! Confused me, since I'd heard only the last two minutes of a basketball game count.|Celtics|2
all of em haha||3
I can't believe he took it. Balls of steel.|76ers|831
People always doubt Kyrie's clutch.  He's by far the most clutch guy on our team.|Cavaliers|2
No, Kyrie don't shoot. No, not yet.\n\nOh God. Oh God.\n\nOh GOD IT'S IN. They're gonna win!|Bulls|2
Look ma, I can shoot 3's too!|Trail Blazers|2
I thought so too at first, but they were tied 89-89 with less than a minute to go.. if it goes, great, if not, meh.||2
the guy was hot, plus, when did you see Irving NOT taking it?|Nets|4
mr 4th Quarter for a reason\n|Cavaliers|11
Why don't you believe he took it?  The game was tied, so it really wasn't that risky.  Did you see how many missed shots in a row had occurred before that?  Felt like the score was stuck at 89 for 3 or 4 mins.\n\nFor the record, not taking anything away from Irving.  Was definitely THE shot of the game.  So much props for nailing it at that point.||10
Kyrie is pure clutch.|Cavaliers|7
JERSEY |Knicks|3
championship tier player. Shot the three ball in the face of the best shooter in the league. ||8
Kyrie's balls were so big Curry's shots were stuck orbiting them|Wizards|9
He did it! The absolute madman! |Raptors|220
As a Cavs fan who watched basically every game for the last 2 years, I can  you that shot from Kyrie in that huge moment was not really surprising |[CLE] LeBron James|1
I can't believe he's done this.||1
That gold train only went for 3...||1
Good fucking yard mate\n||1
You mean Iceman.|Bulls|1
MCGA||2
/r/madlads|Spurs|6
So i told Kyrie to take a 3 for the championship, and he did it!\n\nAboslute madman!||17
*shades of "PAXSON FOR 3!"*||9
BAH GAWD KANG||4
Lebron James take a fucking bow. Coming back from 3-1 to this Warriors team is incredible. They will make a 30 for 30 on this one day, no doubt. What a series.|Cavaliers|1305
And the first shot will be Cleveland fans burning LeBron jerseys and fading into them celebrating the very same player. ||1
No doubt. ||1
Instant classic |Wizards|2
*What if I told you it takes a team to win a championship, but it takes a King to rule the Land?*|[CLE] Mark Price|3
Aren't they always in past tense? \n||1
I appreciate how the benchmark for historic sports moments is whether ESPN memorializes them in a 30:30 documentary. |Grizzlies|6
If he never hits another shot in his career, he's still immortal in Cleveland now.||13
idk his wrist got hit pretty bad. Imagine if he seals the game with that dunk||3
Funny how times change. Just a few years ago they were burning his jerseys and cursing his name.||15
Well, the whole "Decision" thing was just tactless. He had his reasons, and that\'s all well and good, but he handled it like a fucking knob. \n\nGlad he\'s back though. |Cavaliers|3
I, for one, never thought I\'d see the day that I was rooting for Lebron after the whole "Descision" bit. But goddammit if I didn\'t sit there cheering for him the whole time.||10
Really solidified his career narrative.  Also the fact that he may have just had two of the like 7-8 best performances in finals history against record setting teams doesn't hurt.  ||12
Yeah, being the third player to ever record a triple-double in a Finals Game 7 ain't a bad place to be|[MIN] Andrew Wiggins|1
One of the best game 7s I've seen. Too bad Curry didn't show up. I swear I thought Curry was going to go off for 30 but Draymond had to go shit I do it then. This game would have been of epic proportions seeing Curry go off like he did the regular season. CURRY HAS NO CLUTCH GENE. - Skip somewhere |[OKC] Russell Westbrook|12
Skip is probably going to say Kyrie saved Lebron at the end. |Heat|3
He's been tweeting that Kyrie should be MVP all night.|Bulls|1
The "Believeland" 30/30 is outdated and I love it!||27
Believeland 2: the LeBelieveining. ||5
At least I can pretend this never happened until I see it on classics in 20 years. |[GSW] Monta Ellis|18
Walking funny tomor will remind ya.||1
As a Pats fan, be ready for random sports center countdowns to give you PTSD.  |Raptors|13
Don't watch ESPN|Warriors|1
Yes life must be tough as a Pats fan. Stfu. |NBA|34
I know I feel sorry for him. Good thing I root for the eagles.||5
Can't wait for future JR Smith to do his 30 for 30 interview on a hoverboard|[CLE] Mark Price|634
bravo. take an upvote!||1
Pipe?||2
wearing whatever those goggles were during the champagne popping|Spurs|6
The fuck was that shit lol. Had me rolling |Cavaliers|1
looked like snowboarding goggles to me. you ever get booze in your eyes? shit sucks.|[MIL] Giannis Antetokounmpo|2
JR just gave maybe the best post-game press conference ever. Amazing.|Cavaliers|20
Is it posted anywhere?||3
http://screengrabber.deadspin.com/j-r-smith-breaks-down-when-asked-to-describe-the-inspi-1782261705|Cavaliers|22
Thank you!||2
Damn. Respect for JR and his family. ||5
Dude, you're fucking amazing. Thank you for that.|Spurs|7
Thanks for posting that man, that was awesome. Congrats to you and yours. |[OKC] Gary Payton|5
Oh man that was so emotional. I teared up when he was talking about his parents and broke down.|Cavaliers|8
AS A CAVS FAN SINCE 17 DAYS AGO YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW MUCH THIS MEANS TO ME\n|Nets|4624
We in here fam! |Cavaliers Bandwagon|1
AAAAAAAH I'VE WAITED A WHOLE WEEK FOR THIS MOMENT|Cavaliers Bandwagon|1
Wrist in peace||1
It's father's day, and I turn 29 on Thursday.\n\nHappy birthday to me.|Cavaliers|1
As a cavs fan since i watched their documentary on netflix, I am pleased they made more balls in the hoop than their mortal enemy||1
As a fan since 2 days ago, We did it!|Celtics|1
Dude, congrats!|Cavaliers|1
IS IT A LOT?||1
Congrats fam|[MIA] Dwyane Wade|2
I too have been a diehard Cleveland fan since they won game 3. \n\n\nThis victory is so special to a long time #1 fan like me||2
As a person who has hated Lebron's guts since the High School Phenoms DVD came out, you have no clue how upset I am he just got another ring.\n\n\nWait until they put Kobe back in.|[LAL] Kobe Bryant|7
I know you're joking, but seeing the Warriors choke like this meant sooo much to me as a Thunder fan. |Thunder|3
Meant a lot to us who are Bulls fans who jumped on the Thunder Wagon, then the Cavs Wagon!|[CHI] Michael Jordan|1
WELL TELL US!?!!|Hornets|3
EXTREMELY HAPPY|Supersonics|2
Haha likewise mate - LeBron is God.||3
AS A CAVS FAN SINCE 17 MINUTES AGO YOU DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH THIS MEANS TO ME|KnickerBockers|7
I JUMPED ON THE BANDWAGON 3 HOURS AGO AND IT'S BEEN A WILD RIDE|[MIL] Giannis Antetokounmpo|6
As a Cavs fan since game 3 you have no idea how much blood sweat and tears I have put in. I have stayed up till 4am every game just to watch the cavs play. I now know their key 7 players names. |Cavaliers|47
Yo, I know you from /r/codcompetitive and /r/opticgaming! Small world|Cavaliers|1
I've been a fan for nearly this entire series so I know what you mean. ||75
Found the Thunder fan.||1
Me too dude!!!!!!! It's stupid how happy I am about this|Clippers|985
hahaha, i completely forgot that I, too, can be apart of this championship!|Grizzlies|1
Cavs fan since 8:30. Amazing year guys!|Raptors|1
Winning bandwagon is best bandwagon||1
Bandwagoner: "It\'s our sense of humor that sustained us as a fanbase for 50 years."\n\nCleveland fan: "52."\n\nBandwagoner: "52, even better!"|[GSW] Stephen Curry|2
Our suffering is finally over!|[LAL] Smush Parker|2
Samesies. But been a Bron fan since '03. |Spurs|2
Me too! It bugs me when I'm called a bandwagon fan cuz I cheer for the Cavs; I've had a Lebron James jersey since '03. I'm a Nuggets fan but I just like the dude! Respekt the dude for performing under all that constant pressure ||1
WE RIDE THIS BANDWAGON INTO THE SUNSET|Cavaliers Bandwagon|2
I just became a fan about 30 minutes after the game ended and this is the greatest day of my life!!!!|Cavaliers Bandwagon|3
So siked!!!||2
Lol I teared up|[TOR] Cory Joseph|3
Me too. My whole family went berserk. Me, my brother, and my dad were yelling, my mom was crying with joy. Somehow we all got so invested in winning one for THE LAND. We're from Phoenix and all Suns fans, so we empathize with sustained sports misery and heartbreaking near misses.|Suns|7
I never put on that flair, but I was for sure cheering for Bron.  It was like, 60% wanted Lebron to win, 40% wanted Draymond to lose.|Celtics|563
Funny because Draymond probably deserved the W the most after that performance.|Rockets|3
And me!|Cavaliers Bandwagon|6
How bout them Rangers tho|Thunder|2
I know right! Craziness|Cavaliers Bandwagon|3
St. Louis fan here... \xf0\x9f\x98\xa0||1
Pretty much same ratio here. Except the 40% is shared by Draymond, injustice against Steven Adams, Warriors fans, and Ayesha.|Magic|3
Yeah, fuck Green. ||3
In my eyes, it was like 60% wanted draymond to lose, 40% wanting to see the city of cleveland to win because of believeland .... and then fuck lebron|Clippers|7
you almost won, i mean if lebron broke his arm at the end.|Lakers|3
Similar for me, 50% wanna see Green lose, 40% wanted Bron to win, 10% just didn't want GSW to have a better season than the 95-96 Bulls.|Bulls|8
Curry seems to think of himself as a god. So watching him lose is always satisfying|Trail Blazers|47
People hyped him up too much. He's good, but not *that* good. Lebron was a beast. |Raptors|23
he was super un-cluch tonight.  That airball 3 near the end was "REALLY STEPH?"|Nets|3
Steph did his best JR Smith impression tonight. He was chugging some rediculous shots and nothing went in.|Celtics|2
Curry shattered the all-time threes record that he set himself last season. At the same time, his team went on to win the most regular season games in the history of the sport. He is that good. But that doesn't mean Lebron isn't better.||8
America loves winners, but even more than that, we love to see winners fall|Celtics|16
See: Ronda Rousey|Bucks|8
Ever since he beat his chest against the thunder I've wanted to see him lose it all. ||41
LaBronne's arm banging or stompystomp act never bothered you?|Bulls|-4
For me it was when Green started kneeing Steven Adams in the nuts, shit was crazy man.||11
Same position, but also couple that with 100% wanting Golden State to lose|Cavaliers Bandwagon|16
I'm not sure you guys are familar with how percentages work. \xc2\xaf\\_(\xe3\x83\x84)_/\xc2\xaf||3
And 100000% seeing Jr get a ring for his pipe|[NYK] Kristaps Porzingis|12
JR with the b2b 3s and Stump proving that he's not totally useless with the timely 4 point play|Vancouver Grizzlies|1
The whole team stepped up big time|[NYK] Kristaps Porzingis|1
That's why I'm sure Harrison Barnes is gonna be the scapegoat|Vancouver Grizzlies|1
Now that this series is over and after you recover from this epic party y'all need to revisit your math lessons.....ummmmmm hmmm||1
JR for sure coming back next season with a championship cockring |Celtics|8
KYRIE I LOVE YOU|Cavaliers|1009
That sealed it. The beginning of the end. :(|Warriors|1
Kyrie Eleison down this road that I must travel.||1
I could easily blow Kyrie. Especially after that 3.|Clippers|1
Lebron is the mvp but to me kyrie was the mvp||2
CLE hold it down||2
So. Fucking. Clutch.|Hornets|2
KYRIE MOTHERFUCKING IRVING. FUCK YES.|Cavaliers|2
Does this kind of erase that Duke stigma now? Outside of KAT Irving is my new favorite player, dude seems calm, although he should NOT have been driving with that much time on the clock...||2
KYRIE IRVING HAS FUCKING ASCENDED ON THIS BLESSED DAY.\n\nCONGRATS CAVSBRO|[BOS] Kermit Washington|2
Shout out to the random kid I played 2k16 my park against who said kyrie Irving is the best PG in the league over 5 months ago. I bet that motherfucker is ecstatic right now. Kyrie is clutch|Bucks|3
It's a shame how little kyrie's game has been mentioned recently :( i'm really happy for him.|Knicks|3
Said some dumb things in the game thread but he was so good this game. |Raptors|3
We've all said some dumb things in game threads. It's like drinking.|76ers|3
fuck pnd|Bulls|9
KYRIE IMPREGNATE ME|Cavaliers Bandwagon|14
Damn, Kyrie taking the shot over Curry really made the picture perfect|[BOS] Ray Allen|16
What a fucking shot|Kings|85
This guy lives for the moment, he's becoming one of the top clutch players in the league. [I still remember one of his first game winners.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l6sCA1ZT5qM)|Magic|2
Him and LeBron deserved this series more than anyone else. They played out of their minds.||6
My dad was a life long fan of Cleveland sports. He passed away last year, but I am so proud of Cleveland right now, and I couldn't be happier that this could happen on Father's day, I know he would be so happy.||665
Reminds me of my grandfather dying the year before the Red Sox finally broke the curse of the Bambino. |Celtics|1
I'm sorry to hear that.\n\nIf the Cubs ever win during my lifetime, I'll lose my shit. My late father used to take me to Cubs games as a young child. When I got older, and we moved away, we used to watch games on WGN on lazy summer afternoons. He never got to see them win it all, a fate too many Cubs fans have in common.|Bulls|1
My dad was a life long fan of Bay Area teams. He passed away last year. While I am appreciative of the way Cleveland played the last three games, I couldn't be sadder that this happened on Father's Day, I know he would be so crushed.|Warriors|2
I hear ya buddy. Mom from Cleveland passed away in September. \n\nFortunately got to watch and celebrate with my dad tonight. It was something else.||2
So sorry to hear. I was lucky enough to watch the game with my Father who watched the 64' Browns. This win is for all our fathers who suffered through 52 years. This win is for you||3
Your old man must be proud! It's amazing how much sports impact our lives, I'm glad we're all a part of it.||2
Im feel you all..my dad has little time left and we watched the game with my kids...im on bended knee praying for you and your dad up in Heaven.||3
This gave me the FEELS I am so happy you are happy :')||8
Same my father passed last August.  Had the same thoughts.|Cavaliers|6
I'm sorry for your loss.|Cavaliers|7
In the same boat. My dad grew up in Akron. So happy Cavs won but it's so bittersweet I can't celebrate with him.||17
I'm sorry for your loss. My old man passed away 4 months before the White Sox won it all in '05. He was a die hard fan. It's something I'll never forget, you're going to cherish this for the rest of your life. ||22
Paulie, Podsednik and Dye absolutely killed it that series, your old man would be proud. I'm a cards fan and my dad is a Yankees fan but baseball is the sport we bond over while we live in Chicago. RIP |Bulls|8
Thanks bud, appreciate it. I hope you guys get many more years of baseball together!||2

He blocked a game winner. |Celtics|-1
Still coulda missed. It's a jumper. I'd say higher degree of difficulty on LeBron's.|Magic|3

You had one hell of a run my friend. A true cornerstone of our post game threads. Will you keep it up next year or is this a one year thing?|Lakers|2
74-8 isn't probably happening in a while, or ever. So I think might be good to end it right here with the all time greatest regular season record. But on the other hand, I would definitely like to see it end with a W.\n\nWe'll see. Maybe someone else will keep it going, I don't know.|Warriors|2
I feel you man. Sorry bout the loss. Looking forward to watchin your fuckin dubs tear it up again next season. |Lakers|2

None of the teams in any of the Big 4 pro sports in America that have the best all-time regular season ~~record~~ win total won the championship...\n\n-2007 New England Patriots (16-0, lost Super Bowl)  \n-2001 Seattle Mariners (116-46, lost ALCS) + 1906 Chicago Cubs (116-36, lost World Series)   \n-1995-1996 Detroit Red Wings (62-13-7, Lost Conference Finals)  \n-2015-2016 Golden State Warriors (73-9, Lost NBA Finals)  \n\nEDIT: Updated it to win total to make it more accurate for NHL and NFL and added 1906 Cubs||609
Can we also include the undefeated Kentucky team losing in March Madness? Like 2 years ago|Pacers|1
I knew Golden State didn't have a chance. |Celtics|1
Damn that's crazy. |Lakers|1
Regular season means nothing. It's all about who's hot in the playoffs||2
Because I'm a pedantic baseball nerd I have to say, the 1906 Cubs ought to be considered the best all-time regular season in baseball. They won 116 games as well but did it in a 154 game season as opposed to the 162 it took for the Mariners. \n\nBut at least your overarching point stands since the Cubs lost the WS that year. |Mavericks|2
This just confirms to me that playoffs are pretty fucking random. |[TOR] Jerome Williams|2
This is actually amazing. |NBA|2
Also 1906 Cubs (116-36, lost WS)||9
That's actually a better record than the Mariners.  Why is Seattle always cited as having had the best MLB record?||6
Yeah I'm not sure. They don't even have the most wins, it's tied.||2
Best record for a 162 game season||6
I suppose that makes sense, but surely that Cubs team would have won at least 1 of those 10 games they didn't play.  That's more impressive to me.   But whatever, the Mariners record is impressive, too.\n||1
For what it's worth, there were only 8 teams per league in 1906 and 5 of the NL ones were pretty weak. Two of those 5 (St. Louis and Boston) were absolutely atrocious and essentially fielding 1-2 major league caliber players and then a bunch of what should have been minor leaguers. \n\nI know the Boston team at least (which later became the Atlanta Braves) was awful because the AL had just recently become part of the major leagues and their Boston team (which is now the Red Sox) offered way better contracts, so basically every remotely good player left the NL team for the AL one. I think something similar, though not as drastic, happened with the NL St. Louis Cardinals and the AL St. Louis Browns (now the Orioles). I'm not entirely sure on that one though. Either way both teams were absolute garbage.\n\nThe Mariners didn't have the luxury of regularly facing competition that was quite so terrible. They had the A's in their division (who had the next highest record that year with 102 wins) in their division and then mediocre (but not *too horrible*) Angels and Rangers teams. They were below .500, but they both had better records than the bottom two teams in the other AL divisions, so the West was unquestionably the strongest AL division that year.\n\nOverall, if there was a way to adjust for the era and all, the 2001 Mariners were probably the better team and their record was probably more impressive. |[MIA] Ledell Eackles|5
That all makes total sense.  I would imagine that any modern team would have much better athletes, too.||1
That's not entirely true. The 1976-77 Canadiens hold the NHL record for points in a season with 132. They have less wins but also less regulation losses than the Red Wings. If you actually do it by winning percentage they have them beat. Red Wings' winning percentage would be .799 (Ties count as half a win) and Canadiens' would be .825. The Canadiens won the cup that year.||4
72 Dolphins were undefeated unless you count the Pats over them because they played two more regular season games|Hornets Bandwagon|2
'72 dolphins. Undefeated regular season and won the Super Bowl ||5
What about the Bulls||7
Well, yea, the stat wasn't true up until like 25 minutes ago.|Bucks|21
Technically the '72 Dolphins went 14-0 and won the Superbowl. Even if it was a different era of football.|Cavaliers|29
But 16-0 is better than 14-0. ||1
If fans still count Super Bowls going back to SB I, then the Dolphins undefeated season definitely counts.. getting annoyed with this stupid Mariners/Patriots stat.|Thunder|6
Well, isn't 16-0 a better regular season than 14-0? The statement was about regular seasons.  \n  \n116-36 (Cubs) *is* better than 116-46 (Mariners), though.||16
Sure it is "better" but both are a perfect 1. Patriots just had to play 2 more.|Heat|4
This was false before this year. GG Warriors |76ers|237
It was false before an hour ago|Warriors|1
Hopefully false after this year too. Go Cubbies |Suns|1
Wow thanks warriors you ruined everything||1
Warriors losing and still setting records smh|Spurs|7
'72 Dolphins did it. ||15
Season was shorter then, the Pats technically won more regular season games. |Thunder|9
A championship is still a championship though.|Lakers|2
Well yeah, but the point was that none of the teams that hold the regular season wins record went on the win it all. |Thunder|4
Except the dolphins in 72|Lakers|2
Man, I'm really not trying to get into an argument here, but this is a pretty simple concept. In 1972 the NFL regular season was 14 games, it is now 16 games. So the 2007 New England Patriots own the NFL record for most regular season victories, at 16, and they obviously did not go on to win the super bowl. |Thunder|5
haha, honestly, I'm not trying to get in an argument either. Sorry, I just had one of those moments where simple things don't compute. I get it now. Did not mean to sound hostile. I see what you're saying now - no team has both the best record *and* the ring. Which is true, I thought you were saying something different entirely. I thought you were saying no team finished *their* regular season with the best record and went on to get the ring.|Lakers|2

Whoops.||2
You mean 2-2-1-1-1? It was the original format so I'm cool with it.|Celtics|2
Yeah shoot my bad..||1
To be fair if teams are down 3-1, they will always use the Cavs as an example that it is possible to come back, however unlikely.  People will still call it tho because it's basically a 3% chance to come back and win it all in the NBA Finals.||1
You'll find this out very quickly after following the NHL playoffs on almost any given year.  ||1
Yes they are. Just not if one of the king is on the team that's down. ||1
Next year they'll be calling the Cavs dead when they start out 7-3.|Celtics|2
Not while The King still has air in his lungs. |Pelicans|2

People said "yeah but this is different" compared to OKC up 3-1 when GSW went up 3-1. Said Cleveland just couldn\'t keep up or win two road games against the greatest team by record in history.\n\nYet here we are.|[OKC] Steven Adams|13
I gave then about a 2% chance. The Draymond debacle helped.||6
Agreed he shouldn't be suspended, but even w/ Draymond back LeBron still scored 41 & then got another triple double. Not sure him being out has too much of an effect, & it certainly didn't make the Warriors lose the last two|[OKC] Steven Adams|0
Draymond was back on a road game, and this shit got to his head like the game after the Adams kick. He was bad in that game too. |Vancouver Grizzlies|1
There was a narrative that Green was a bit passive as his potential rough play could take him out in game 7. And at the very least Green could have his best game in the last game, which by evidence he did. \n\nThe thing has been the Splash Brothers evolving into the Trash Brothers in the biggest game of the Finals and having all the advantages to them. Wasn't only the 3-pointers that was not going in but Steph's decision making in clutch situations. ||4
"This will go down as the most lopsided finals ever." \n\n\n\n- Stephen A. Smith|[CLE] LeBron James|20

They aren't the only team to win a series down 3-1. The Rockets did it recently against the Clippers.\n\nThis is the only time it happened in a finals series.\n|Vancouver Grizzlies|10
He's asking if they're the only team to win after being down 3-1 (the Thunder) and then lose after being up 3-1 (the Cavs), not whether they're the first team to win being down 3-1. ||16
Ah. Yeah. Then I think so. |Vancouver Grizzlies|2
ESPN just tweeted about it https://twitter.com/sportscenter/status/744732362387431425||7

Holy shit. I completely missed it. Even after specifically checking the ball haha||17
Ehh. I'm still not seeing anything?|Celtics|2
The entire ball is his face. Instead of looking at the specifics of what's in the ball just look at it as a whole.||18

LeBron has ascended\n\nHe's a Demigod now\n\nI've never felt like this for a team I'm not invested in lol...\n\nLeBron comes out on top of the biggest Finals game ever. Down 3-1 to best regular season team ever|Jason Willams|2715
Watching him track down Iggy and swat that layup was absolutely incredible||1
Is this his Final Form????||2
He just completed what was essentially his life's work.  He's been the King since he was 16-17.  His goal was to bring a championship to Cleveland.  He not only accomplished that goal, he did it by overcoming a 3-1 deficit against literally the best (regular season) team of ALL TIME.  \n\n|Hawks|2
The legacy is intact. That was truly amazing. |Bulls|2
I went into this series not really caring at all who won, I was pretty deflated by the Thunder's collapse and just wanted the season to be over.\n\nI watched the first 4 games and thought the Cavs might steal game 5 once I heard about Draymond. But never in my wildest dreams did I expect anything like this. Seeing the Cavs celebrate made me so happy. Congratulations to all the Cleveland fans! You guys deserve this. |Thunder|2
Same here, not invested in nba at all but it was an entertaining and great game to watch. Cleveland winning made it an amazing series to watch even for those who don't watch nba often.||2
LeBron is SSJGod now.|Bulls|2
Man I know. \n\nNever liked him but I converted to LBJism these playoffs. \n\nAll Hail!||2
He was incredibly clutch. Only way to put it|Spurs Bandwagon|2
Seriously me neither.  I feel like the Sixers just won.  Incredible.|76ers|5
Cleveland has already started building the statue of him.|76ers|3
Same here. I might be feeling more emotional than our (Spurs) last chip. |Spurs|3
That 2014 championship was so sweet but this was also incredible. |Cavaliers Bandwagon|1
Now that I think about it, both were instances of sweet sweet revenge. But to come back like Cleveland did against the best regular season team ever and to win a championship for a city that never had one...just amazing.|Spurs|2
This about sums up my feelings.  I'm bummed the Spurs didn't make it this far, but damn if I don't love a story about overcoming the odds.|Spurs|2
I love my Spurs don't get me wrong, but I always tell people I'm an even bigger fan of the NBA as a whole. Games like this are a good reason why. And I'm pretty content with our 5 chips for now, I mean sure I'd always love to see more, but when we have a good season and lose I get over it a few days later and look to the next team I'd like to see win it all for whatever reasons. I've been a LeBron fan since I started watching the NBA and I really wanted to see him, JR, Kyrie, RJ, TT, and Delly get one for The Land. |Spurs|2
I'm jumping around my hotel room right now at 4 in the morning. I can't even imagine what it'll be like when the Grizzlies or the Braves get one.|Grizzlies|2
Well I'm clearly older than you because my heart is STILL broken from '95. Tribe is going on 70 years without a World Series championship||1
Born in '97 so I just missed that one. |Grizzlies|1

100% agreed.  This is a wonderful story.  Congrats to Lebron and Cleveland|Lakers|5

Seeing lebron get emotional post game makes me genuinely happy that they won|Celtics|1254
His post game interviews are always genuine and insightful. One of the things he doesn't get enough credit for. ||1
Seeing Dan Gilbert, however... I mean I'm sure he has invested a lot of money and time into the team, no doubt, but I can't stop thinking about that Comic Sans letter everytime he talks about LeBron lol|Heat|1
Where's his wife!?|Knicks|1
Dude. It was incredible how invested I was in this game. \n\nWhen UNCLE FUCKING DREW hit that shot, I shouted so loud, my neighbor woke up and yelled at me. \n\nI DON'T FUCKING CARE! #BELIEVELAND|NBA|4
Lebron is one of the best players of all time. He deserved this more than anyone else.|Trail Blazers|4
My fucking wife started crying when she saw JR Smith crying! \n\n|Timberwolves|6
Lue cried on the bench by himself a little too long. It got weird...||19
Did you see lue interrupt Kevin loves interview - love looked sad.||1
Kind of like how Pop was after the 2014 finals|Lakers|1
He coached them for half a season. Not to take away what he did, but he was gifted this team. |Raptors|3
I know. He was acting like Herb Brooks or something ||1
Its not like they picked him up off the street. He was still with the team the whole time. He just got a promotion.|Lakers|2
He was crying tears of joy that he'll still have a job next year |Knicks|3
When he dropped to the floor and you could see the realization hit...that's something incredible to Witness. This was his professional goal. This was a life goal. Years of trying. Years of failing. But he fucking did it now. This is one of the greatest moments in basketball.|Knicks|11
I cried. ||4
Me too.  Also I want to see Cleveland burn to the ground in riots|OKC Hornets|582

Wait 3 hours, 2AM local time. We gotta have time to drink too much in celebration.\n\nWill report when part of drunken riot burning down Cleveland.|Cavaliers|2
wait until they steal the nomination from trump at the republican convnetion|Knicks|2
Riot if you win, riot if you lose... Win-win if you wanna see riots, hot damn.|Magic|2
Just left downtown. The streets were shutdown. People riding fire trucks. Lots of crying and hugs. 0 malice and all positive energy. The police are doing a fantastic job. |Cavaliers|3
We won't stop at the land, we'll set the river on fire too |Cavaliers|3
It will then be nice and ready for the Republican Convention.|Celtics|5

And like I said to the other guy, I was there six months ago. It ain\'t exactly the opposite of a shit hole.\n\nMaybe one day you can look at the world and say "Shit, I\'ve been choosing to live *here* all my life?" and have the common sense to move out.\n\nEnjoy a town where you can finally have a semblance of success instead of spending your time getting drunk and thinking why you live there.|Pistons|-2

Well I'm a guy on the internet, believe what you want. I can also not believe you like Cleveland, because it's simply not possible.|Pistons|-2
Never been.||0
You wish Detroit was Cleveland. ||6
If Detroit was Cleveland, I would too be ashamed to live here.|Pistons|-9
Well it's worse than Cleveland, so what are you still doing there? ||1
Enjoying life because it's better than Cleveland. Imagine that, a city isn't just the hood. |Pistons|-2
Lol I'm not even from Cleveland. Just busting your balls. ||1
Eh, just wait for the RNC.|Cavaliers|1
Yeah, really. And I don't see the entire town burning down. It's surrounded by an awesome river that would put the fire out.\n\noh wait|Pelicans|6

Sha'Ron should have her coverage sheet ready this morning. I asked her yestreday||3
Rule #1 for proper rioting:  \nFirst stop is the liquor store.  So you can finally have all that alcohol you can't afford. ||4

Ahhh yes, the booing of the commissioner, that most sacred and universal of all fan reactions. ||231
I believe it started in the gladiator days||1
And they are booing the best commissioner in all of sports, fans can be so dumb sometimes.||5
Tbf it isn't much of a contest to be the best commissioner and the fans were pissed that the league office suspended Draymond. |Celtics|6
love draymonds game, but he hit too many players in the nuts too many times||16
>best commissioner\n\n>Rob Manfred|[CLE] Zydrunas Ilgauskas|3
I think it was a mix of booing him cause he's the commissioner and booing him because he's the representative of the NBA and some warriors fans feel like the NBA favored Cleveland ||6
Which is weird considering that somehow Draymond didn't get suspended more.|Timberwolves|4
And on this Sunday, the holiest days of fandom, we boo the commissioner. It is written. |Thunder|3
Still kinda pissed a a team with sleeved jerseys won the championship, fuck you Adam Silver!|Celtics|5

CLEVELAND WINS IT'S FIRST PROFESSIONAL TITLE SINCE 1964, WHEN LBJ WAS IN OFFICE.\n\nWITH KING JAMES B2B 41-POINT PERFORMANCES, AND A CLUTCH KYRIE 3, IT'S BEEN DONE.\n\nINCREDIBLE, AND A LBJ FREE THROW AT THE END ICED IT ALL. |Heat|1799
NBA title and heavyweight UFC champ in a month. Well done. ||2
AND FIRST TEAM EVER TO COME BACK FROM 3-1 DEFICIT IN THE FINALS||2
A little less than six years ago, most of Cleveland basketball fans were burning LeBron's jersey and cursing his name. ||2
>WHEN LBJ WAS IN OFFICE.\n\nDang didn't know Lebron's been around that long|Kings|2
Idk why they keep saying this. Lake Eerie's AHL team won the Calder cup last week.||4

EXCEPT FOR THE AHL TITLE THEY WON LAST WEEK||7
Incorrect. The Lake Erie Monsters, an AHL team based in Cleveland, won the championship this year. ||9
Back to back 41 point games followed by ONLY THE THIRD TRIPLE DOUBLE IN GAME 7 HISTORY!||8
Lake Erie won a pro hockey championship last week.|Raptors|10
yeah but their AHL team just won the Calder cup last week.||32
First major sports title, Cleveland won 3 soccer championships in the 90's. Also 64 was the last time Cleveland won the Calder cup so it seems like the key to winning major championships is winning AHL hockey.||2
I know this is a very old thread, but I figured I'd point out we also won the Calder Cup in 1948 (when the Indians last won).|[CLE] LeBron James|2
The comment said FIRST PROFESSIONAL TITLE SINCE 1964, which isn't true. ||5
Lebron should just run for mayor now.  Cleveland is gonna go nuts when they get back.  So happy for James/Kyrie/etc and the Cleveland fans.|76ers|183
With the current pool of shit candidates, Lebron could steal the presidential election|Lakers|1
Im going to that parade and i'm going to riot like a true mid-western gentleman. ||1

He could definitely make an impact in the presidential election in Ohio by endorsing somone|Cavaliers Bandwagon|1
I'd move to the state just to vote for him. I'm beyond happy for that guy. All the hate and criticism ends with him bringing a championship home, where he first brought hope as a 1st round pick out of high school.|Bulls|3
If he waits 19 years he could win president with all the new babies about to be born. |Lakers|9

Thats.., a weird stat|Cavaliers|11
Pretty sure ESPN has a weird stat generator to give people things to talk about. Not saying I'm necessarily upset by it, because sometimes that stats are actually interesting. But they do seem to come out of nowhere, and for no real reason.|Grizzlies|1
I mean I get it...they are trying to say LeBron never plays real good teams. It's just stupid.|Jason Willams|6
No! LeBron should have changed the rules to where top 16 seeds make the playoffs so he could have vanquished more 50 win teams!|NBA|1
I'm pretty sure they're intentionally making shitpost stats just for us now.|Wizards|72
Its a shop are you blind?||8
ESPN does stuff like this all the time though ||5
ESPN doesn't change fonts mid title.   The reason ESPN posts so many stupid stats is because you need to fill your 24 hours of programming for multiple channels.  There isn't enough sports to talk about so you need to have dumb stats for people to argue over.||3
Are you an employee or something?  That's not a fucking excuse, show American Gladiator re-runs if you don't want to fill time with live coverage. ||1
Just because I go against the "fuck espn" circlejerk doesn\'t make me an employee.||1
Curry was a major disappointment. You can't be the regular season MVP and then go 6-19 for 17 points in game 7 of the finals. MVPs just can't do that. But congrats to the Dubs for a great season.|[NYK] Allan Houston|389

Especially after calling out the Cavs bench after Game 6. He really set himself up for failure by talking all this shit.|Kings|4
Seriously. He disappeared in the last 3 games.\n\nI guess baby face ain't a killer.|Supersonics|5
Not just that, he really didn't make up for it in other ways. For example, when Kobe was ice cold in game 7 in 2010, at least he did work on the glass with 15 boards. Steph didn't score and didn't really do anything else well either||9
he watched Irving drain that game winner in his face||17

Ayyy|Jason Willams|10
Is it funny that every member of the big three was crucial at the end of that game? Lebron James' block and ft's, Love's crunch time play defence on Curry and Irving's 3 pointer?. Funny at the end every member played a part even Kevin Love. ||92
I feel like Love was playing on 100% adrenaline at that point.  I can't imagine the feeling of being 30 seconds from a title and having to guard the best shooter the game has ever seen.  I so desperately have wanted him to work out for this team so him showing up at the end there makes me the happiest person ever.|Cavaliers|2

Anderson Varejao has to be the saltiest feeling person on earth right now.||135
I keep seeing Vaerjo's name come up. Why what happen?||2
He was on the Cavs team last year that lost to the Warriors. He went to the Warriors team this year and they lost to the Cavs.|Thunder|3
>  team last year that lost to the Warriors. He went to the Warriors team this year an\n\nhe still gets a ring though....|Cavaliers|1
Why does he get a ring though? He was on the losing team both years? ||1
from what I understand that it's all players that were on the team throughout the season... but from other posts I have seen it seems like the team can choose to give it to a player that was traded mid-season/dropped etc... I would imagine the Cavs would offer it as he was on the team for such a long time and beloved by the fans while here.|Cavaliers|1
He played for the cavs during the regular season as well.|[MEM] Bryant Reeves|1
Ah I see, so he only recently moved over? Was he traded, or was he a free agent that decided to leave, i'm not too privvy to that side of basketball.||1
He was waived by the Cavs and picked up by the Warriors. I'm not too sure the timeframe for that though.|[MEM] Bryant Reeves|1
Varejao spent his entire career with the Cavs until the trade deadline this season (2004-2016). He was a vital part of many Cavs teams, one of LeBron's favorite teammates, and a fan favorite. However, during LeBron's second stint in Cleveland, Varejao was almost always injured and unproductive on the floor.\n\nVarejao had an expensive contract and the Cavs were desperate to get rid of it. So they waived his contract earlier this year and he ended up being picked up by the Warriors.\n\nSo Varejao, always tantalizingly close to getting a ring with longtime teammate LeBron, found himself playing the Cavs in the Finals. He played his game, flopped around and was a pain in the ass on the floor, but he lost to the team he had dedicated his career to. So he must be the saltiest man alive right now.\n |Cavaliers|2
Doesn't he get a ring either way ||3
He can if they want to give it to him. I think they do, Because he was cavalier for so long, and while sure he flopped In the finals he is just doing what he can to help the team he is currently on win. It's not like he tried to injure anyone or anything, flops are annoying but he wasn't dirty really. I think he earned one by being in Cleveland for so long. |Nuggets|10
They should, he helped the Cavs win the series|Vancouver Grizzlies|1
It personally wouldn't mean much to me to get a physical ring. I think any competitor would feel empty if they didn't actually play (in the Super Bowl, finals series, World series, etc) to help their team actually win it. Even if you're injured or something. ||10
True, really he can say he has a ring but like you said, whats it really worth if you didn't do anything to earn it in that playoffs. It's basically just a nice gesture from the cavs at this point. Not giving it to him would be super petty though, not like Gilbert has ever done anything petty. |Nuggets|10
Ive been feelin bad for David blatt a bit tonight |Bulls|7
Don't feel bad for him, they would've lost if he was still there.|Raptors|7
Reminds me of Marian Hossa losing the Stanley Cup with the Penguins against the Red Wings, signing with the Red Wings the next year, and losing the Cup to the Penguins.||22
And then going on to win 3 with Chicago. I'm sure he's over it now, lol.|Raptors|3
Yeah true. He's better than Varejao is anyway||1
I posted this in the game thread, but here is what i hope the Cavs will do. \n\nVarejao is sitting in his house when the doorbell rings. He opens the door to find a package that says "from Cleveland". His heart begins to beat in anticipation of whats inside. \n\nHe tears off the tape and digs though the packing peanuts to find a beautiful velvet ring box. Thousands of emotions run through his brain as he slowly opens the case. \n\nInside is a single note that says "fuck you". Underneath is a plastic toy ring with a mold of Varejao as he is falling to the floor like his been shot. \n\nAfter a few monents Varejao grimaces and clutches his chest. He collapses to the floor and stops moving. The paramedics are called. When they arrive they start taking his vitals. The head paramedic freezes and then says, "i\'m sorry to say this, but he is faking it". |Trail Blazers|784
That was beautiful |Heat|1
I hope they send that bitch a ring pop.|Cavaliers|1
I'd like the think his flop game is so on point he could just stop his heart ||1
I love you. |Cavaliers|6
As a Cleveland fan for years, I want Andy to get his ring. He was our heart for years. Was he a flopping bitch in the finals? Yes. But he played as best he could for his team, even though the opponent was his friends and family. I respect that.|Cavaliers|12
For real though, does Varejao get a ring since he was on this Cleveland team? Or do you have to be on the team in the playoffs?|Cavaliers|8
Oddly enough both Andy and Blatt are eligible for rings |Cavaliers|1
He is eligible, but I doubt they give him one.||3
Really? I can't imagine they wont. Spent his entire career with Cleveland, traded mid-season as a salary credit, signed up as a free agent. My money's on him getting one.|Cavaliers|9
He was picked up solely to give inside info on the Cavs schemes. Its a classic Belichekian move. Fuck Varejao. No ring for him.||3
From what i have heard, it's the teams decision|Trail Blazers|7
Actually, I think it's the team's decision to a point. I believe if the player played so many games for them in the past season, they're required to give a ring under the current CBA. I need to look it up though to be sure.|Bulls|1

I\'m sure you\'d love to hear about NFL HOF legend RGIII and how he led the dynasty Browns to seven Super Bowl wins in eleven years."|NBA|40

If this happens the Browns sub reddit will have to actually go to some sort of therapy or take some sort of class in order to relearn what happiness is. \n\nDuring the NFL season I would always go there after the Browns game, just out of curiosity, and I can honestly say, those might be the saddest people in the country. I think it might be at the point where they wouldn't even be able to comprehend the Browns winning a Super Bowl. All they know is despair. Love those guys though, good dudes.|Lakers|5

Do you really think the majority of the Warriors fan base stuck around for 8 years? I have been seeing people wearing GS jerseys in Maine.|Lakers|9
I think the Warriors have always had a great fanbase. Trashing fan bases of successful teams as all being bandwagoners is lame enough, trashing a legit amazing fanbase is ridiculous. \n\nThose Baron Davis Warriors crowds were fucking *live.* \n\nStop being dumb.|Raptors|-14
I didn't say the Warriors never had any loyal fans. I'm saying most of their *current* fans are fair-weather/bandwagon fans.\n\n>Trashing fan bases of successful teams as all being bandwagoners is lame enough, trashing a legit amazing fanbase is ridiculous.\n\nNo it's not. It's an important social mechanism for segregating those who have stuck through the bad times from the people who want to be associated with winners. I've been Lakers fan since I was 7, when Travis Knight first suited up. I went to my first Lakers game was in 2002 -- it was gainst the Celtics (Kobe had 41 points on 47 FGA that game). Do you know how much shit I got for wearing a Lakers shirt and a Red Sox hat? Think I got called a bandwagon? You can *almost* always tell who the true fans are. True fans know their team and it's history, if you ask them specific questions they can answer correctly what bandwagons cannot.\n\n\n|Lakers|2
Some would argue using "crowds" to grossly over exaggerate overall fan support based off of one postseason is dumb. But to each his own.|Rockets|3
Doing anything you can to try to convince me the Warriors all bandwagoners, huh? Not gonna work, sorry. |Raptors|-9

Tell me what you're trying to say then, shithead.|Raptors|-13
That the point you're trying to make, GS fans being loyal non front runners, based off of a single postseason run, is incredibly shortsighted. Furthermore, framing said postseason run in the plural as if it were an era or something, is inaccurate.\n\nI'm just responding to you. Do I think all GS fans hopped on a bandwagon? Of course not, that's a ridiculous assertion. But to suggest one doesn't exist(for them or any franchise since you evidently want to be overly technical for whatever reason) is asinine. I saw at least 10 people this weekend wearing GSW jerseys in HOUSTON. Guess how many people I saw here doing the same before 2014 that weren't attending a Rockets/Warriors at the Toyota Center? ZERO. Some Warriors fans can chat you up about Adonal Foyle, some can't. End of story. So again, stop it. |Rockets|3
Original comment was "first time yal lost in the playoffs since you started watching basketball." Implying **they\'re all bandwagoners**. This isn\'t fucking complicated and yet you\'re trying to defend that statement like "dude I saw some people in Warriors jerseys just the other day!" Lmao fuck outta here. \n\nI was cheering for Cleveland. I think they both have good fanbases and you just know Cleveland is going to get the same "bandwagoners" treatment from absolute tools like you next season. Lol you fucking cornball.\n|Raptors|-2

I don't think there's much beef at all with Kings, if any.  (Personally I do feel a little bad about 2002.)  There are some Laker fans that don't like the warriors.

Huge rivalry with the Kings? Yeah, it was intense more than a decade ago, although I'd say we really don't care about Sacramento anymore enough to call it a huge rivalry. Although this might just be me though.|Lakers|1
I feel like the person you were responding to is pretty young and isn\'t aware of the passion of our rivalries\n\nI agree a lot with your analysis with a few minor changes.\n\nCeltics are clearly first. Although these past few decades bring the Spurs closer than a "huge gap". I hate them a lot, but I respect them too. I would say there\'s a minor gap between the kings and clippers (minor) but the suns are right behind the clippers (beating us 2 years in a row is not forgotten).\n\nLast, but not least, LeBron and Dwight are in the mix somewhere with the Kings, Clippers, and Blazers|[LAL] Sasha Vujacic|2

The Chicago Bulls previously had a record of 72 wins and 10 losses in the 95-96 season, and won the Finals to take home the ring.\n\nThe Golden State Warriors beat that record this season, having 73 wins and 9 losses, but just lost the Finals to the Cleveland Cavaliers.\n\n\nThe warriors might have had the best season of all time, but it don't mean a thing without the ring. \n||23
Thank you so much for this explanation!||5
Even if the won, I don't think anyone would have said otherwise. Not after going down 3-1 in the WCF.|Raptors|4
72-10 just has a better ring to it||15
Oh this is good. |NBA|1
Doesn't even compare man, that bulls team could destroy any team in history|Knicks|6

We're not thinking outside the box here. If I know my boy Lebron, and I know my boy Lebron, then he is gonna do something way much more doper than go play baseball. He'll go to the nfl, take my boy Russ Wilson's QB spot for a year, bring us another SB ring, and give it back to Russ in Seattle then join his Cavs home for three more years.|Supersonics|5

I watched GoT and went to bed after cause I had to get up for work early in the morning. I read the paper today and they said something about the Warriors last basket being at like 4:24. I was so confused what they meant until I watched a replay of the game today.||1

Bringing in Ezeli was a fucking disaster. GG Cleveland. Well played.|Warriors|3
Arrogant bullshit stylish playing cost them the game.\n\nCurry is arrogant as fuck, why the hell else would you do a behind the back pass, near out of bounds, in a Game 7 of the NBA finals?|Raptors|12
That's what I thought too. Such an unnecessary flashy play with a huge margin of error. |[IND] George Hill|3
small* margin of error|Nets|1
Too many forced shots.  Also that clutch block by LeBron basically won them the game.  We really needed Bogut because Festus and Andy did not contribute to this game but the Cavs played well.  LeBron played great (as expected).  Kyrie had some crazy clutch shots and KLove actually showed up.|Warriors|31
Curry saying at the presser that they settled for shots.  Said they should've driven to the hoop a lot more.|Kings|1
Curry tried a few times. It rarely went well for him.|Cavaliers|2
I'll never understand why Kerr didn't put Mo back in the game when he was doing so good. I thought he was saving him for later. Don't know.||2
dont forget JR he saved the cavs imo in the beggining of the second half, he had like 8 or 11 points in a min which tied the game|Raptors|7

LeBron had a triple double and was incredible on defense in game 7. ||2
Don't get me wrong I'm taking nothing away from Lebron. He's the greatest player in the world and single handedly took the team on his back. But without that 3 from Kyrie the championship most likely would have gone to Golden State. \n\nHell of a game man. |Cavaliers Bandwagon|4
In the same boat you could say without the block from Lebron Golden State could have won. It was a complete game by 2 amazing players.|Pacers|6
Kyrie did a hell of a lot more than that 3. The man was phenomenal, especially in the last 3 games.||8
I'm usually a Kyrie hater, but you can't possibly downplay how great he played this series overall...|Heat|1
Seriously. Kyrie played amazing but he didn't win this game anymore than LeBron did. ||5

Winning last year probably helps the sting. My Pens just won the Stanley Cup. It was great and I'm happy but it didn't feel the same as when they did it back in 09.||1
I'm with you man.  I've come to realize that myself.  Lebron gave his sweat blood and tears to bring a championship to Cleveland.  I'm happy for the Cavs.|Warriors|7

Amazing CAVS THEY DID IT!||70
the absolute madmen||3
The Cavs played better... or scored more points I'm not sure which. I won't be silent.|Wizards|4
The last 5 minutes was just horrible offense by both teams. Save for the play that got Lebron his FT's to seal it.\n\nSeriously 54 seconds left, down 3. Cavs made 1 shot in last 2 minutes. Curry dribbles a full 23 seconds and takes the worst 3 I've ever seen. What's up with that? There was enough time to go for a 2, maybe call a timeout for a quick score.  \n\nWell deserved win for Cleveland|Bucks|122
Ezeli...||0
Live by the 3, die by the 3||1
In his defense, Curry takes a ton of shots that look horrible that have no right making it in, but they do generally for some reason. ||1
Tough to score down the stretch... less ball/player movement.... teams clamp down, fatigue\n\nI agree with u re curry pounding it ibto the ground||2
Thank you. The game as a whole was insane but those last minutes were so painful to watch. Very poor basketball. |Lakers|5
That's kind of how game 7s go. It's ugly, desperate basketball.|Lakers|5
Yeah well game 7 pressure tends to do that to teams. ||2
Steph Curry always plays really horrible offense he just makes a shit ton of awful shots 95% of the time. But when they\'re not going down you realize "wow this looks awful"||6
If those horrible 3 point shots go in 45% of the time, is it really a horrible shot though? He played the same game he has for the whole season, except this season his shots weren't falling. ||4
That's not true he may not be the best at spreading the ball around and playing the point guard position but he's great at getting himself space to make shots. And he's good at driving. He doesnt just stand there and chuck threes ||7
To be fair, Kevin Love played the best defensive possession of his life on that play|Supersonics|6
It was rugged on offense those last few minutes, but you might not be giving enough credit to the defenses. Guys were moving like mad, and there were no driving lanes at either end. Everyone seemed to be at a loss on how to get closer to the basket, and the difference in the game is one highly contested Kyrie 3 that happens to drop.\n\nProps to guys playing defense like everything was on the line. At least that's how I saw it.|Warriors Bandwagon|9
I fully agree. He had Kevin Love all over him and he was fully guarding the 3 ball, Steph could have taken it to the hole all day, but Love stayed home and refused to bite on the fake (the fake being the crossover then fake drive to hit a stepback 3). Great defense by Love and a horrible decision by Curry. No need to play hero ball when you are on a team that won 73 games, and won by almost 30 without much help from you in game one. All of those weak side help blocks that LeBron had on him got in his head.|[DAL] Eduardo Najera|7
 This so much. Kevin Love fucking showed up to play, hope this inspires him to contributing more defensively and working on that part of his game. I think curry got cocky seeing Love on him and all the circlejerk (justified) got to his head.|Heat|3
That last 4 minutes was the worst three chucking contest ever. The old timers would be rolling in their graves. I was fully expecting Curry to drive the basket for the 2 point lead. I mean sure his percentages overall say the three is better, but after not scoring for that long you just gotta make a bucket and get the lead.|Raptors|19
Say whatever you want about a rigged system, the Warriors had plenty of chances to win tonight and didn't hit the shots.||115
That wide open 3 curry had...|Celtics|1
Plus a lot of questionable calls went the Warriors way, and that last three minutes the cavs just beat the fuck outta them defensively no question ||1
they should have been up 15 easily. curry was ice fucking cold. |Bucks|1
I'm a firm believer that it's generally rigged in attempts to get game 7's and maybe later round match-ups. There was a fantastic story line for either side if they won, so I didn't see a reason for the NBA to care who won.|Bulls|1
Well the Cavs were 1-14 on threes at one point. Can say the same shit for both teams||2
Yeah, I guess I'm really talking about how down the stretch the Warriors had OPEN looks and couldn't hit the shots. ||1
Why we talking about the election ?|Timberwolves|2
Are people suggesting this was somehow rigged? Other than Mrs Curry I mean.||3
Maybe not this game, but game 6 smelled like the ocean...||-1
I don't think it was rigged.\n\nHowever, the referring style of the NBA allows more physical play in the playoffs. This favors the cavs especially after the warriors started getting hurt. To someone who hasn't intentionally observed reffing or reffed before the series could appear rigged. Also game 6 was a horribly reffed game||4
I really did not like that foul call on Draymond either. Either way, you win the game you are presented, and you show your dominance from coming back from adversity, so congrats to Cavaliers.|Warriors|1

People will always be talking about Lebron, but Kyrie Irving is the one who really fucking stepped up and turned the heat on this series. Without him, this series would've ended in Game 5|Wizards|168
Kyrie should get FMVP but I think Lebron will get it regardless.|Bulls|-45
I'd argue Lebron was the best offensive and defensive player this series.  It had to go to him.\n\nKyrie's G5 was incredible, perhaps the most efficient we've ever seen, but playoff Lebron is when his elite defense comes out.|Pistons|11
Championship teams need that guy.  That dude who hits threes or just gets a ton of boards in a big game.  Kyrie is a baller, all NBA type of talent.  So was scotty pippen.  People forget how many big games he had.  ||2
>Kyrie should get FMVP\n\nNO|Hawks|31
It all came down to Game 7 and Kyrie sealed it. I understand Lebron played amazing in most games but Kyrie saved them in Game 5 and here just in the final seconds of G7.\n\nIt only makes sense to me.|Bulls|-31
If only the last shot mattered then maybe. Lebron beat Irving in every stat up there in all three of these last 3 games. Irving had an amazing run, beat out only by the best player in the NBA.||15
I mean there was no way he wasn't getting it anyways. That was the narrative. It was a much easier pick than say the Warriors had they won.\n\nI'm just glad this is over now, I was getting way too nervous for no reason whatsoever, lol.|Bulls|-16
It's not conforming to the narrative, he was easily the best player despite kyrie playing great ball.|East|7
Back to back 41 points and then only the 3rd ever triple double in a game 7 final (shout out to the Logo and Big Game James Worthy)\n\nTl;dr L+B+J = FMVP|Lakers|26

Without LBJ the series would have been over in 4... Or not even played cause no way Cavs are getting there without him.||1
I agree, but without LeBron this series is probably over in 4|Cavaliers|1
We\'ll always talk about LeBron because LeBron stepped it up too. Without LeBron playing even better than Kyrie it would\'ve ended in 4. But you just expect LeBron to be there and say "well Kyrie did this that\'s why they won" ||1
No. Miami lost to Toronto. |Suns|1
Yup. He was just an assassin from game 3 on. Proved that he deserves to be counted as one of the best guards in the league||2
It's almost like it's a team game...|Raptors|3
Why does it have to be one or the other they both stepped up hugely to get them the wins. |Raptors|7

I don't know, I felt like the Cavaliers were a 2-man squad for several of those games man. If anything, these games showed the transcendency of LeBron. There was Tristan Thompson, LeBron James, and Kyrie for 2 games.|Warriors|3

Patriots hadn't lost a single game in the NFL which has WAY more parity than any professional league beside MLB.\n\nNot to mention they had a top-3 QB of all time, top-3 receiver of all time, top 3 coach of all time, and like 3 HOFers on defense. The team was so stacked it was like the pro-bowl team wouldn't beat them.\n\nI assure you, Curry Thompson Kerr is not nearly as good as Brady Moss Belichick.||2

Disappointing to who? This is awesome as a Warriors hater|[HOU] James Harden|25
Disappointing to Warriors fans?  I mean, it's not that hard to think who would be disappointed by this if you remove your bias.|Pacers|31
Shit I'm not even a Warriors fan and I'm disappointed. Obviously I'm happy Lebron won and the narrative is great and all, but I was pissed to see the 07 Patriots go down just like I'm pissed to see this. I like to see perfection, I like to see perfect games, I like to see records broken, I like to see the pinnacle of a sport. Who but haters wouldn't like that?\n\nSincerely congratulations to LBJ, the team, the organization and the city, but as an outsider I'd have been disappointed and elated for different reasons, if either team won this. That's part of what made this game so hype, so big, the narratives were compelling in both directions.|Pistons|22
Y'all haven't had to deal with them shitting all over your team and shitting on your subreddit. \n\nGood for them and their historic season but I'm happier that they lost than I would be if they won. |[HOU] James Harden|2
From what I've seen, the Warriors haters have been way worse than Warriors fans.|Pacers|6
Thanks man|Warriors|-2
Yeah, there are going to be people outside of Warriors fans being disappointed, but I was just pointing out that acting like nobody would be disappointed is silly.\n\nBut yeah, seeing perfection (or as close as you can get with the NBA) is always awesome to see because it's such a unique thing in sports.|Pacers|1
I don't know if the Cavs would've had another chance though. |Pelicans|3

At age 31:\n\nMichael Jordan - 3 rings, 3 MVP's. 3 FMVPs\n\nLeBron James - 3 rings, 4 MVPS. 3 FMVPs\n\n\nIt's safe right now but you're wrong if you don't think there is a looming threat.|Raptors|3
LeBron's legacy will always be tainted by having to go to Miami for his first 2 rings tho, Jordan never had to do that|[LAL] Kobe Bryant|3
That's because Jordan had a squad from the get-go. Lebron invested seven years in Cleveland without them getting a single other big, nothings tainted.|[CLE] LeBron James|0
No it won't. How is that tainted? That's fucking stupid.|Raptors|0
Jordan never had to do that cause he had competent management that got him Scottie freaking Pippen whereas at first the best Cleveland could do was Mo Williams.\n\nJordan's supporting cast was just as good if not better than anything LeBron has had.\n\nLet's not forget Jordan's lack of team success until Pippen entered the equation.|Raptors|7
All true, but it'll still be taken into consideration that LeBron left his original team before winning when people look back and compare their respective legacies|[LAL] Kobe Bryant|3
Sounds much more like an accomplishment to me doing it with multiple teams and multiple non-HoF coaches wouldn't you say?||0
Lebron also has 4 more seasons under his belt than Jordan did at that point|Bulls|5
Well Jordan wouldn't have been winning any of those things before he was 22 either to be fair, with Magic and Larry kicking around|Raptors|3
Not until LeBron stretches out his arm from the half court line for a dunk will he even sniff at MJ.|Bucks|11
[he is definitely coming](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3554046/)||3
It's plenty safe but you're right he's getting closer. |NBA|6
At age 31:\n\nMichael Jordan - 3 rings, 3 MVP's.\n\nLeBron James - 3 rings, 4 MVPS.\n\nJust some food for thought, both have 3 FMVPs too and both dominate the record books.|Raptors|0
MJ had tons, TONS, of clutch performances at age 31 than LeBron. Way better than LBJ in the Playoffs. It's a fact.||3
Care to prove that with statistics or nah?|Raptors|1
Not stats, but full games. You can watch old games.||1
So you don't then|Raptors|1
Yes but after watching Tiger's career my whole life, I no longer care for comparisons by age. All throughout the 2000s it was deemed inevitable that Tiger would surpass Nicklaus as they compared them at certain ages. What people quickly underestimate is how difficult it is to sustain the greatness in the declining years. And the declining years always come. |NBA|3
Tiger had some very different circumstances though. Mostly injury. LeBron has shown that he doesn't get seriously injured. Too strong |Raptors|0
>LeBron has shown that he doesn't get seriously injured\n\nThat's a pretty weak spot to plant your flag. It's based on an implied prediction that a man approaching 50,000 minutes of NBA play isn't going to get seriously injured.|Thunder|2
Look how strong he is. He won't get seriously injured.|Raptors|0
But they literally said the same thing about Tiger. And I don't want to saturate this point but people said that cuz of the way Tiger works out as a golfer he could be winning until he is 50. Then boom. |NBA|2
The 2001 Lakers think you worked a bit too hard in the regular season. |Lakers|5
I feel like they should have been back on top anyway after all of GS's playoff losses.  Bulls had a better winning percentage and fewer losses.||4
Wooh!|[CHI] Jimmy Butler|17
Moral victory FTW!|Bulls|8
I dunno....MJ might have been dethroned as GOAT after today.|[CHI] Toni Kukoc|1
Nah. No way. MJ still the playoff king. His Playoff exploits were stuff of legends.\n||2
I won't lie, as a Bulls fan I've spent over a decade rooting against LeBron, but that was just incredible. I was pulling for Cleveland. The city deserves it. Congrats Cavs fans, and thanks for knocking off the team that beat my Bulls' record. |Bulls|20

The better PLAYER won.|[TOR] Jonas Valanciunas|17
I don't even know about that. Curry was the unanimous MVP for a reason. He just played like shit when it mattered the most.|Heat|-16
When it matters the most is *when it matters the most*||1
LeBron can still dominate in a way that no other player can, on both sides of the court when he is motivated. I think people (including me) got it twisted seeing Curry's historic regular season and LeBron's average(by his standards) reg season. Further proof that playoff basketball is a different sport |Warriors|2
The better player won||21
Yikes. Nobody actually discusses anything here. It's all circle jerk |Heat|-10
are you seriously suggesting steph curry is a better basketball player than lebron james?|Wizards|9
Um no. But I'm not making knee jerk reactions like everybody else on this sub. Like I said. Unanimous MVP for a reason |Heat|1
Yikes. Nobody actually discusses anything here. It's all circle jerk|[HOU] James Harden|0
regular season isn't the best measure though. Look at Lebron every year or some of the Spurs championship teams|[HOU] Tracy McGrady|1
for what reason? he choked. unanimous mvp shouldn't play that poorly when it really matters|Wizards|2
Curry might have been injured too but LeBron was a fucking animal in the finals|[TOR] Jonas Valanciunas|9
Ya no way Curry is the better player. Lebron is the better overall athlete and defender. I don't see Curry making superman blocks on Lebron.|Cavaliers Bandwagon|7

I don't know man, that wrist took a brutal hit||1
LeBron just raised his legacy to another level. Truly amazing to watch the Cavs will their way back from down 3-1. Congrats Cleveland and enjoy, this is what sports is all about.||53
Great game. Congrats to all the Cavs fans that have been waiting for this moment their whole lives. Yall deserve it big time. |Warriors|76

I have no doubt. Cheers buddy :) |Warriors|3
Cheers to you as well! On to the offseason shitposts|NBA|2
We saw it last year for the first time in 40 years last year, now they get it for the first time in 54 years and the first time ever at the same time, after watching Lebron come and go and come back to win one for the Land. Awesome to finish on a close game too!|Warriors|7
My thoughts exactly. They've been through a lot over the last half century, and this was a very long time coming. I'm bummed that we lost, but I couldn't be happier for the Cavs and especially their fans. |Warriors|7
In a way I'm still glad the Cavs won, they got to feel what we felt last year x100000000.  First NBA championship in decades for us, first NBA championship in forever and first championship in any sports since the 60s for Cleveland.  If I were in their shoes, I'd be streaking across downtown.  Seriously, congrats and hope to see you again next year Cleveland.|Warriors|5
Thank you. You guys played a hell of a series|Cavaliers|5

Don't take the credit away from the Cavs|[PHI] Nerlens Noel|9
All credit to Lebron, Kyrie, Tristan Thompson, and the Cavs. But the Warriors clunked games away. Harrison Barnes disappeared in the last 3 games. The Cavs completely earning the wins and the Warriors losing those games aren't exclusive to each other. The Cavs stepped up while the Warriors shrunk back. ||5
I put a lot of it on Kerr|Timberwolves|1
Not to mention they stopped doing the fundamentals in this series like boxing out.\n\n\nSo many offensive rebounds for the Cavs and TT wasn't even on the floor for many of those.|Lakers|1
And that I swear Draymond is the only person on the Warriors who could spell layup. I got frustrated watching Curry and Thompson refuse to take layups and instead kicking it out. ||2
You'd start looking over your shoulder more as well if you got swatted by LeBron the way they did.|Cavaliers|1
I'm a Bay Area fan, I love the trash that is the 49ers, I love the Giants and I love the Warriors. I'm so proud of what the Warriors did this season, especially Steph, Klay, Draymond and Iggy, but all I can say is Kyrie is something special and Lebron is a once in a lifetime player. I love Steph and I love my Warriors, but congrats to the Cavs and that was amazing basketball...good shit Cleveland.|Warriors|144
Props to you for being an actual fan. You guys were definitely the highlight of this 2016 season. Until next year! |Thunder|3
Hey man, I'm just happy to enjoy some solid basketball from my hometown team! We got one last year, Curry, Klay, Iggy and Draymond played incredibly this season and the team was amazing to watch. Obviously I wanted to win it, but Lebron and Kyrie came to play so props to them for showing up. I have to say though...I think we've got the best shot at it for next year!|Warriors|2
Niners are the most successful team in the bay tho|Lakers|8
They are, but I was born in 93 so I can't take too joy in our success and we are still a shit show! We hold season tickets and I'm a diehard fan, but lets call thew 49ers what they were this past season. Here's to hoping that Chip turns them into something special though!|Warriors|6
Look on the bright side, it's an even year so if the past 5 years mean anything, it's the Giants' year to win the World Series |[PHI] Allen Iverson|2
EXACTLY!!!! The only thing that could make it better is if Lincecum was on the team, but hey Cueto, The Shark and Bumgarner is nothing to complain about!|Warriors|2
That JR  Smith postgame interview was intense. |[CLE] LeBron James|15
I wasn't a fan of his when he was a Knick, but I'll be damned if I didn't love him during that interview. That kind of honesty doesn't happen every day.|Knicks|1
As much as it hurts right now, I'll admit it: one MVP showed up and the other did not. I'm a fan of the Warriors, but a fan of the game too...and you cannot deny the play of LeBron. Congrats to Cleveland, they earned it. But Warriors will be back, and I expect them to compete just as hard if not harder for another ring!|Warriors|16
Can we also talk about Timofey Mozgov? He was on the Cavs team last year when they were going by "Lebron & Friends" and had many great performances that helped them not get obliterated last season. This year he was def good enough to go and start for a lot of other teams but instead he stays with the Cavs and barely gets any game time at all. Is he mad though? Nope, he\'s the first one jumping off the bench to celebrate whenever his team scores. I\'m happy he got to be a part of this in some way.||15
Similar thing with Delly too (though not as extreme as Mozgov). Goes from playing major minutes all season to Lue picking Mo Williams over him as the finals went on. But like Mozzy, he was hyped at every Cavs play. |76ers|2
I didn't [do too bad](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/4a4e0e/what_are_your_no_guts_no_glory_predictions_for/d0xgdgv). In fact, I fuckin' nailed it. |Cavaliers|43

I gained tremendous respect for Draymond when he waited for Bron to finish his interview before giving him a bear hug. I think he's the only Warrior I saw congratulating LeBron.\n\nCrazy considering the words he had for Bron a couple games ago. He's so easy to dislike but hard at the same time.||12
That was surprising. I thought he genuinely didn't like or respect LeBron.|San Diego Clippers|2

Lebron's block on Iguodala may be one of the most defining plays in his career to me. Hopefully it isn't overlooked. |Knicks|22
No way it'll be overlooked. That block was everything.||1
Hell no it wont. Saved the game. It makes the the Tiago block look insignificant.\n\n||2
In the grand scheme of things, that Tiago block was pretty insignificant. The Heat were up like 20 when that happened. It was an amazing block but had literally no outcome on the game. This block could be LeBron's legacy defining play. One of his most iconic plays ever. ||1

Found my new background.  ||1
Steph Curry was completely exposed these final three games. You cannot rely on a player whose only offensive ability is to shoot three pointers because it becomes extremely predictable. That last 5 minute stretch was Curry doing everything he could to try and get a three off. Just horrid offense from the "unanimous MVP."\n\nYou need to have more ways to create shots than running around screens and attempting step back 28 FT+ threes. In fact, Kyrie Irving vastly outplayed Curry this entire series, both offensively AND defensively, and it\'s only fitting he hits the huge dagger three over the heavily criticized defense of Curry.||120
He's clearly not been himself since his injury and trip into the stands. He's looked like an extremely different player since that. Less speed, less accuracy, less everything.\n\nWe'll hear the truth soon I'm sure. Not taking anything away from the win, but this wasn't the same Steph.||-1
What about when he erupted versus Portland?  Was that the same Curry or a different one?|Rockets|8
Who knows? Sometimes players take a while before their injuries get more serious and it's a possibility that his Portland series caused more stress on his body.\n\n\nOnly way to tell is when the off season comes and we hear what's wrong (assuming there is something wrong) with Curry.|Lakers|1
As I said, he hasn't looked the same since his trip into the stands.  Even that one 40 point game he had, I didn't think was when he was at his best.||2
Excuses homie.   It's best to just take the loss and move on. |Rockets|2
I'm from Pittsburgh. Compare his pre-injury stats to his post-injury stats. Guranteed there's a clear dip. Watch his regular season games and watch his post-injury playoff games. Huge difference.||3
You can do all that work if you want.  I don't really need to. |Rockets|0
Then don't waste my time.||-3
Wrestling is fake|Heat|-1
But Game of Thrones is for realz man.||3
You're the one making medical assessments that you have no idea about.  Curry himself said he was fine and that his injuries weren't a problem.  He just wasn't good enough.   That's all there is to it.  No need for injury excuses.  I'm sure Curry would say the same thing himself. |Rockets|7
How can you convince anybody that the huge dip wasn't due to him choking in the finals, much like he did last year?|Cavaliers|1
[It's not like I started a thread about it](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/4lky8h/something_seems_wrong_with_steph_and_the_warriors/)||1
Or it isn't easy to perform to that standard when the Cavs defense performed out of their skulls. Great defense can make an amazing offensive team appear mediocre. I agree Steph did not look like himself and did not perform to the standard of a unanimous league MVP, but I think the reasoning was a combination of choking and great defense.|Cavaliers|1
what? you can still get on hot stretches as a player even when your not 100%||5
here we go. "he was injured"|Bucks|34
Seriously he did not use the excuse himself in the post game at all. He even said no surgeries planned. |Heat|8
"Make or miss league" had never sounded more true. |[CLE] LeBron James|2
Curry has a great game of cutting to the rim, and he gave that up at the end. But you also have to give Cleveland credit, they doubled Curry a ton, forcing quick shots. They knew if you played hard nosed defense, slowed the game down, then the team that can make 2 point shots will beat the team that shots 3s.|Supersonics|3
> Curry has a great game of cutting to the rim, and he gave that up at the end.\n\nOr maybe he was afraid of LeBron\'s looming presence. In the back of his mind, he was thinking, "If I drive to the hoop, is LeBron going to embarrass me again?"|Cavaliers|5
Nah, let\'s be real here. I strongly dislike Curry, but he\'s more than you\'re giving him. He\'s collapsing under pressure. He is one of the league\'s best finishers, an above average midrange shooter, and the best 3point shooter of all time. The issue with this is that when his threes don\'t fall, he loses confidence. And "shooters", even though they have other stellar abilities, literally cannot succeed without confidence. It was obvious he was doubting himself. \n\nWas he shit this series? Yeah. Is he maybe overrated a bit? Yeah. Is his only skill shooting 3s? Fuck no. |[NOP] Anthony Davis|29
He is not the best 3 point shooter of all time. He could well be in a few years. But he is not that yet. ||-4
Nah. Skill wise he is. Does he have the greatest career ever? No, that\'s Ray Allen. But you\'re telling me that the dude who makes 400 fucking 3s in a season-- 100 MORE THAN ANY OTHER PLAYER IN ANY OTHER SEASON-- at a ~45% clip isn\'t the best shooter of all time? No, he is, and talent wise that\'s a fact and its undebateable. His 402 this season is 116 more than the next best season; guess what? That next best season is his record too. Yes, Ray has the career record. So for the moment he is the "Greatest" shooter of all time. But if you don\'t think Steph is the "Best" shooter of all time then fuck outta here, cause a dude who has made 1.5 times as many 3s in a season as the next closest player (Klay Thompson) is the indisputable most talented shooter ever. |[NOP] Anthony Davis|8
So when he is down he crumbles like a dry cookie. Not a real finisher|Cavaliers|-1
Yeah he took a ton of credit for the loss post game. He definitely let it get to him and the pressure was huge on him to deliver as the de facto 'leader' of the team. \n\nEven Lebron acknowledged it's not easy to lead and be the calm person even when you don't feel calm yourself. Unbelievable to me that the cavs kept their composure so well when this is a few of their first times to the finals, and GSW literally were here last year. \n\nJust a masterpiece by the cavs. |Heat|6
Part of the reason LeBron did so well is that he has so much experience being "the guy" despite losing|Warriors Bandwagon|3
Oh yeah, this. He was so used to losing and being scrutinized that it almost didn't bother him anymore.||3
Although they lost, I gotta give respect to Harrison Barnes. After all the backlash for making 0 shots in games 5 and 6, he responded tonight by going 3-10. Props to him. |Timberwolves|29
Amazing.|NBA|19
Fuck Anderson Verejao |Lakers|18

This might be the most historic thing I've ever seen in my life. A 73-9 team winds up 88-18 and doesn't win the title. Cleveland - FUCKING CLEVELAND - gets a title and despite me generally not giving a fuck about them, I am inexplicably happy for them. They fucking earned this. LeBron just cemented his entire legacy as maybe the 4th or 5th best player ever, and he still has more titles to win for that city. What a night. \n|Pistons|21
I think this cements him as top 3, I think in the end he will be considered #2, and I think he is good enough, especially in the playoffs, to win at least one more. |Cavaliers|3
I think we can all say that LeBron is still the best player in the game.\n\nPeople will ask if he'll leave now that he brought the championship home, but I doubt he would after a win.|Heat|12
i give respect green for going out and taking time to congratulate the cavs. we can hate on him but you got to give respect to that.\n\n\nmeanwhile guess who was the first to go to the locker room? the same guy that said that its a mans game. smdh|Spurs|10

Still, on the court he's dirty but there's a ton of guys like him who don't get as much hate. He's just grinding for his team, and off the court he's a good dude.

I agree. I'm as big a hater as anyone but he had a great game. He was on fire from 3 and pretty much kept them in the game. Everyone else vanished. ||1
I feel like Iggy played amazing defense too, and Livingston, although wasn't as productive in terms of points as usual, had some really fucking good passes and some good defense that game too. Also klay played really good D on Kyrie especially the first half. \n\nBut man cleveland was just wayyyyy too fucking good. So deserved, congrats to Kyrie, Lebron, and all of the rest of the team, holy shit that was amazing to watch.|Lakers|3
Man Kyrie is a fucking offensive monster. That dude is going to be absolutely ridiculous in the next few years. |Cavaliers|1
Yep I was telling my friends I wouldn't have been mad in the least if he had won MVP. 100% deserved it as well as Lebron, but I'm glad Lebron got it because it just adds to his legacy.|Lakers|2
He was out there after the buzzer, congratulating Cavs players and finding LeBron to give him his due.  Good on him.|Celtics|3
Yup. Gotta respect how hard he played tonight. He had an amazing game ||17
Proving its just ball by giving Lebron the congrats after. That's a huge thing in my opinion and much props to Green. It's hard to give congrats after being so close. |Bulls|9
I agree, I don't really like Green, but seeing him and Lebron hug it out made me more okay with him. I'm giving him a second shot. And 1000% better than Klay who decided to peace out immediately like the sore loser he apparently is...||2

Probably an overstatement, but Steph Curry literally shit the bed. His performance in these Finals was nothing near of what you'd expect from a 2 time reigning MVP.|[SAS] Kawhi Leonard|8
They said the same thing about Lebron in 2011 and now look at him. They dont make it to the finals and win 3 games without Curry. This is why people hate Lebron and Cavs fans. Just saying dumb shit now.|Mavericks|0
I'm not a LeBron fan, and far from a Cavs fan. Just glad they beat The Warriors. Can't stand Kerr and Steph's cocky asses. Can't stand Dray either, but that man plays with heart, you can't hate him. \n\nComment still stands. Steph Curry put on a piss-poor Finals performance for a two time *unanimous* MVP.|[SAS] Kawhi Leonard|3
You hit the nail on the head IMO. He's a player that shrivels up in the biggest moments. Hats off to him for a good regular season though, can't take that away from him.|Cavaliers|1
Unanimous hah|Cavaliers|6
Exactly man. Some may call this a "spur of the moment" reaction, but I firmly believe Steph Curry did not deserve that unanimous MVP.|[SAS] Kawhi Leonard|4
Wow, that's some really bold insight chief. ||1

He was on the 72-10 team. He holds the record either way. |76ers|1
I know he was. He had a chance to do it again as a coach. He couldn't win the championship.||1
Yeah definitely hits hard. Regardless, he still was on the best team ever haha. |76ers|1
There were a few Golden State fans that stayed after the buzzer and were applauding after the Cavs won, so shoutout to them. Whether they were applauding the Cavs win or the great GS season, that's really admirable.  |Cavaliers|7

Highlights for me\n\n* Draymond Green was on fire.

The level of play was outstanding.\n\n* Someone correct me if I'm wrong, but was the Oakland crowd chanting 'Lets go Cavs' during the trophy presentation? Bc if they were, that is one of the most respectable and classy things I've ever seen.\n\n* Lebron. Nuff said.|West|5
It\'s crazy how important Draymond was. His points kept GSW afloat. As often as I share the "fuck Draymond Green" sentiment, I respect him for filling the scoring holes that Splash Bros couldn\'t fill.|Clippers|2

Really happy for LeBron. Dude put his life out there on the court and you can tell how emotional it made him to finally bring one home.\n\nComing back from 3-1 and winning it in the finals. Wow. Curry and Klay were both defeated in this game, barely looked like themselves. The Cavs D was on point throughout the entire game, with both Love and LeBron really doing the finishing touches those last few possessions to seal the deal .\n\nThis will seriously humble the Warriors I think. Klay sounded almost certain they were going to win this game, especially being at home. Not gonna lie, feels good to see him leave like a little bitch at the end. Anything can happen in this league, he should learn that by now.|Lakers|5
I know LeBron and Kyrie deserve most of the spotlight, but hot damn did Tristan Thompson do all the thankless things today. He played ball defense on Steph Curry many times and did better than can ever be expected of someone his size. He also got big boards and through them put some key fouls on the Warriors. Gotta appreciate hard work in the paint!||7
TT made me eat my words, I was talking a lot of shit when he got that big contract|Spurs|1
This moment will likely turn Anderson Varejao into a super villain like we've never seen.  |Bulls|7

obviously it sucks but I can't complain after an amazing game like that. I've always liked LeBron so I'm happy for him. This was just an awesome series in general and the Warriors didn't really show much mental toughness until tonight. It sucks that we couldn't close on the 73-9 record but that's how it works. We'll be a good team for years (hopefully) so I hope this lights a fire under us in next year's playoffs, because we'll need it. It was absolutely absurd to watch our guys collapse and miss the shots they were used to making all season. Kyrie showed up, LeBron showed up, and even Steph played the same game he'd been playing all year but just couldn't knock em down. No excuses. I like basketball because of the insane ups and downs and the narratives that go into each game and in that sense I couldn't ask for a better game. Congrats to LeBron and Cleveland.\n\nAnd I'll just end this by saying that Harrison Barnes is the biggest choke artist on the planet. Hope he succeeds wherever he ends up because I doubt it will be in Oakland.|Warriors|5
Well this should make a for half decent "30 for 30" someday...\n\n> "The city\'s failure to win a trophy in any major professional sport since 1964 has earned it a reputation of being a cursed sports city".\n\n\n> "Cleveland are down 3-1 against the best regular season team of all time..."\n\n> "The Cleveland Cavaliers are your 2016 NBA World Champions!"|Rockets|4
They usually do a forgotten storyline tho||1
Believeland part 2|Trail Blazers|1
As quickly as the Media loved Steph Curry and built him up the last two years, they\'re gonna tear him down.  It\'s going to be crazy to see, they did the same with LeBron with the "decision" and now Curry is going to get it, because of his performance this series and the "mouth guard gate".|Lakers|7
Yep||1
Three NBA championships, brought a title to Cleveland, and Skip Bayless is out at ESPN.\n\nThat's a good career imo||3
Curry choked the whole series. I don't get it. Was Cleveland just the better team last year, except got crippled by injuries?||7
The entire seven game finals series total score for both teams was a difference of like 5 points.  With a tiny bit of luck,  GS could just as easily be holding the trophy right now.  It'd safe to say these two teams are very very evenly matched.   I would not be suprised to see them both trading championships for the next several years to come honestly. ||1
I'd say so, they took them to 6 without Kyrie or Love|Lakers|3
Yeah, I was wondering. I only follow NBA casually though.||2
Props to Draymond Green for staying and congratulating Lebron. He had an amazing game. I think this loss will humble the Warriors and they'll come back to reality. ||4
Enjoy tonight, Cleveland. In a month your town will be torn apart by the shitshow that will be the RNC. ||5

So, uhh, that was an embarrassing defeat after being up 3-1.  If I was Curry, I'd move to the other side of the country.  No idea where, but Charlotte sounds low key enough.||5
Charlotte is home for Steph, at least for high school and college.||1
Sorry, thought I had flair here.  I'm a Charlotte native, still live here, and I'm a Hornets fan.  He played at Davidson which is just north of Charlotte.\n\nI've actually met him and his father at a basketball camp.  Anyway, it was just a joke that didn't go over because of no flair :/||1

Great game honestly , one of the most stressful I've watched for sure. Lebron James played incredible tonight , and the block on Iggy with 1minute left left me speechless , like how are you even that clutch? Irving 3 pointer on Curry , man so many great things. Incredible end to an already incredible season.|Cavaliers|7
Those few incredible layups Kyrie had against Draymond, I'm convinced no other player could have made those ...||3

It's Skip's last day. How else do you expect him to go out?|Bullets|3
Skip hates Lebron and always has. This has got to kill him. ||2
Not as bad as when the Heat beat SA in 2013, but it's never a good day for Skip when Lebron shines.|Bullets|2
Congrats to Cleveland. This would hurt a lot more if we hadn't won last year, but you can't expect to get it every season. Cavs played well. Irving stepped up and Lebron was a monster. |Warriors|20
I think this hurts them a lot more than if they had lost last year. The narrative now is "choke", "failure", etc. Last year the narrative would have been "Next year guys! Foiled by Lebron! Shucks!".|Warriors|1
No, because rings are forever. They can say we choked, that Lebron is our daddy, that we only won because Kyrie was hurt. Doesn't really matter. That banner is never coming down. |Warriors|2
Great game by both teams. We choked and the cavs deserved it.|Warriors|8
Yea, I agree. I have no excuses or whines. Klay and Steph missed looks that they had been making all season. The only guy who really put his stamp on this game was Draymond and it just wasn't enough. Iggy was clutch on D, but those free throws....ugh. |Warriors|9
Well the good news is that when the East wins, the Democrats win the presidential election.|Lakers|42

If the NBA decided to use the same rulebook they do for the regular season as they do in the finals it might be accurate to say curry isn't as good in the finals, but it's more accurate to say curry isn't as good at hugging contests.|[GSW] Andre Iguodala|-1

I was at a bar and my friends at home won't confirm:  Did Klove successfully defend curry on the 2nd to last warriors possession?  Big if true.|Knicks|6
Yeah it was so good. Didn't have a great game offensively but rebounding and that clutch defense that possession. Just damn. He made Curry give up the ball and then defended him perfectly AGAIN after he got the ball back. Beast.|Timberwolves|1
He did. Doesn't help that Curry threw up a shot that wasn't there but he's done that all season and Love didn't give up an easy shot.||1
Defended him amazingly |Thunder|2

This is all our faults for shit talking LeBrons finals record |Vancouver Grizzlies|5
James deserved this one. 2-5 wouldn't represent how good a player he has been. 3-4 is much more fitting.  \nCurry and the Warriors will get more chances. They didnt NEED this one like Cavs did.|Thunder|5
He's 3-4, but yes your point stands.|Thunder|1

That game had everything. \n\nLeBron greatness (triple double in game seven? If that's not clutch performance I don't know what is.)\n\nKyrie Irving with actual magic, and the final clutch dagger to put the Warriors away. The dude is ridiculous and I'm very happy he got the chip.\n\nKevin Love with the rebounds. Yeah he disappeared in the second half but still.\n\nDraymond playing really well. He's going to continue to be a star.\n\nCurry and Klay with underwhelming performances. Responsibility does lay on them, but Cleveland did a great job of closing on them and making them run around and get really tired.\n\nWarriors need to drop Ezeli. He's trash. Same with Barnes.\n|NBA|3
If lebron would have dunked on green, I would have orgasmed.||4
I want to talk so much shit for all the hate and the loads of terrible Warriors fans even though some of you are cool, but I think the high road feels better tonight.|Cavaliers|5

Thanks fam|Cavaliers|1
I don't think anyone can really understand how much this means unless they've been part of the Cleveland Sports Experience most of their lives.\n\nPlenty of cities have long stretches of shittiness, or iconic near-misses in big games, but no fans have been more supportive towards less success than Cleveland fans in all of sports. Sports suffering is in our very psyche, and today is so fucking huge.|Cavaliers|4
I wasnt born in clevland, but I was raised in cleveland (and i dont care a lot about sports most of the time), so i never became a fan myself, but i have always respected the hell out of Cleveland sports fans for just how supportive they are of their usually shitty teams (lookin at you, browns)  \nAnd I am just so excited for Cleveland tonight!||1
I could see all the support when the fans were burning lebron's jerseys..not that long ago.||1
I mean... is that a contradiction? They're very passionate about their sports and they felt like their great hope, their home-grown golden child was leaving them. What were they supposed to do to prove they were good fans? Become Heat fans?|Cavaliers|1
Respect his decision. He'd already given the Cavs most of his prime.||1
Wasn't Bill Russell supposed to present it? Why is he even there if he's not?|Celtics|6
That's what I thought so too. ||1
The extra days of rest in this year's finals really can't be understated. Lebron has to play 40+ minutes a night, and last year you could see how tired he was by game 6. \n\nYou could definitely tell he was starting to get gassed tonight, but he was fresh in games 5 and 6 enough to completely take over.|Grizzlies|4
Did anyone else hear that noise? To me, it sounded like millions of Warrior bandwagons simultaneously breaking down. |Raptors|4
Cleveland just gained millions of fans!|[MIN] Tayshaun Prince|2
Really something to think that he just won a championship for the city he grew up in. Every shot he took on the Ohio pavement in the streets of Akron is the same roads he'll parade down in 2016. Wow.||3
Did Doris just get Botox or something? No emotion whatsoever. ||5
No movement in her face at all, so probably. A tough job to have to go into such craziness and give calm interviews but she could also show a little more excitement. ||1
[deleted]||1
I can appreciate her focus on journalism but you can also be excited to be in the moment. No one wants to hear "how are you feeling" questions. It\'s good to dive a little deeper but she is missing something. ||1

Oh yeah. I was surprised it was so close given that he was out. |Bulls|1
Of course he is. Was the big guy protecting the paint, could actually finish at the basket, and generally wasn't Festus Ezeli.|Pistons|2
It seemed easier for the Cavs to get points in the paint once Bogut went out. |Lakers|2

Congrats to Lebron James and Kyrie Irving for bringing a championship to Cleveland. They were thoroughly better than the Splash Brothers in this series, and Tyron Lue outcoached Kerr. With all that said, I hope for a 3rd rematch next season. |Warriors|5

How about Kevin Love tonight. After not a great series he comes out and in a one game series for the title has 14 rebounds and the highest +/- of the game. He has been getting so much shit some deserved a lot of it not and he played a real nice game when the season was on the line. Good for him|Supersonics|4
His defense on Curry that last possession was clutch. I'm happy for him.|Raptors|1

That Lebron block was unbelievable. Going up the floor I thought it was two free points and I thought the Cavs were going to lose - they could barely get a shot off for a few minutes there.  Then Lebron James comes flying out of nowhere and won a Championship.||3
What a story for Lebron:\n\n-Coming from 3-1 down for the first time in finals history\n\n-First championship in 52 years\n\n-Averaged some insane numbers never been done before\n\n-Unanimous finals mvp\n\nLebron is truly a marvel. Congrats to him and the Cleveland franchise \n|Bulls|4
Down 3 - 1 to arguably the best team ever in the finals. That's the biggest accomplishment in NBA history.|Cavaliers|3

I guess I have to begrudgingly respect LeBron now. He has redeemed himself from leaving Cleveland the first time. So congrats to Cleveland, Lebron, and Kyrie. \n\nI know the Warriors won last year but I do feel bad for them. As a Pats fan, I know how it feels to have the best regular season and then come up short. I could see them win another championship in the next couple of years. They'll be back.\n\nEdit: I'll be telling my children and grandchildren about this game and I'm a casual NBA fan.|Celtics|3
WOOOO LeBron has done it! But not only him, the whole franchise and team did a tremendous job! Totally worth staying up for here in Germany :)|76ers|5

> The record don't mean shit now\n\nStop it. This is silly. Twenty years from now people will know who had the best regular season record. I doubt twenty years from now people will know who won the title in 2015-2016. The 73 win season is special, even moreso than winning the title. It would've been better if they had done both, and it's disappointing for them to lose, but that doesn't diminish the monumental task of winning 73 games.|Supersonics|-1
Yeah but 72-10 just has a better RING to it. |Supersonics|0
Is this serious or a joke? Everybody is going to remember how they lost a 3-1 lead and the greatest regular season ever to the Cavs and Lebron. You really think people won't remember the Cavs winning their first title ever?|[SAC] Mike Bibby|2

LeBron lead both teams in points, rebounds, assists, steals and blocks for the entire series. WOW|Pistons|5
Kevin Love played great defense on Curry in one of those last possessions. Give him credit, he stepped up tonight and played hard getting rebounds and playing decent defense. |Knicks|4

Not sure what is up with Adam Silver in Oracle but he also screwed up not shaking Steph hand at the MVP presentation. It is like he gets death threats  every time he is at Oracle wants to get out there alive. "Uhhh...your trophy is over there, I gotta go"|[PHI] Allen Iverson|3
I thought it was pretty funny that they booed him as he called the fans a class act|Bulls|2

The block and The shot|Wizards|1
Maybe we can brand it as "The Block" because damn do I think we lose if he didn\'t pull off the greatest block I have ever seen.|Cavaliers|2
I'm on board with that.|Cavaliers|1
LOL Cavs players are posing for pictures in front of a green screen set as the trophy because LeBron won't let go of the actual trophy|Raptors|5
I can't think of more than maybe a couple controversial calls made by the refs that game. Incredible job by the crew, in the game with the brightest lights and the highest stakes.|Supersonics|3
I don't even have words to contextualize what Lebron did this series...this puts him in legitimate GOAT argument...not absolutely better than anyone yet (jordan, kareem, magic etc) but he has a place in that conversation now and can back it up!!|Lakers|4
this sub was ready to hand him #2 goat (past kareem magic et al) if he won finals... which he did. so i guess he is #2 for now.|Mavericks|2
Its so difficult to rank players because you are comparing players from different eras...so i don't like saying lebron is better than magic, kareem, jordan, kobe etc...instead i think lebron can say that as a basketball player he has accomplished as much as one can in their sport while playing at a high level...|Lakers|1
but you cant literally end the "GOAT conversation" without ranking them. that conversation would go on and on and on and on... are you willing to not go home to your family because of a neverending GOAT conversation?!|Mavericks|1
that is the beauty of sports my friend|Lakers|1
that it is. that it is|Mavericks|1
So is LeBron's block going to become the sidebar image for the entire offseason?  :-)||5
Cavs Big Three all had a *clutch* play in the final moments of the game: Lebron's block, Love's coverage of Curry, and Irving's dagger 3. Their team all came together right at the most opportune time.||3
Any videos of Cleveland fans at the end of the game? I just got back from a music fest and would enjoy some jumping and screaming.||3

Damn can we get an edit of Curry's behind the back pass turnover into him throwing the trophy?|[OKC] Ray Allen|3
Yaasss|Cavaliers|1
does Blatt get a ring??||3
I think he deserves one. It was unfair that he couldn't be a part of this, he could have earned it last year if our team wasn't so hurt. Blatt was a great coach and he inspired Lue. Respect 100%|Cavaliers|5
What a beautiful ending to a wonderful story. We really did it. I love you guys. |Cavaliers|4
The Warriors had too much trust in Barnes and they really felt the loss of Bogut in the lineup. Livingston might have been more help than Barnes as he was almost auto points in mid-range as Barnes was auto-miss.\n\nSaltiness runs in my veins please forgive me.|Heat|3
Maybe the most exciting part is that it's likely we get a finals rematch for the third year in a row next year. This is how rivalries within an era are born. |[LAL] Metta World Peace|5
I wouldn't count out OKC next year if they can hold on to KD and continue to develop Adams game. More room for improvement than GS and the Cavs  from what I can see.||3
Big offseason coming up that's for sure|[LAL] Metta World Peace|1
A loss for all time! A strong reminder of "its how u finish". I cant even begin to know how the warriors feel after this performance. Unbelievable to take that kind of series lead and lose it all. This will stick around. I\'m still trying to wrap myself. pats 07|Lakers|2

I was happy for LeBron since he delivered on his promise to win for Cleveland. At the same time, watching Curry and Thompson only hitting 25% on three-pointers in game 7 was gratifying in a Schadenfreude kind of way.||6
I have never felt more proud and happy to be from cleveland than in these past 12 hours. My entire family was in tears, including my father, who I have never seen cry in more than 20 years||3

You know, as a Warriors fan, I can still appreciate a great year and will look at it like Adam Silver suspending Draymond for getting thrown down by Lebron was a key to the series. It was still a fantastic year by any stretch and they came within a minute of winning it all. not too bad.||1
All we know is that the Cavs can beat the Warriors, at home, with the Championship on the line....and that's with not even playing Delly, Mozgov or Frye.||1
You had a fantastic year. Just less fantastic without the ring. I have no doubt that you'll be contenders next year and win a lot of games... just not 73 of them this time.|Trail Blazers|1
COTY?||1
Coach of the Year|Trail Blazers|2
And all they had to do was score more than 13 points in the final quarter or so. Watching the last five minutes was awful. Best shooters missing everything. Steph's stupid behind the back pass attempt. Ugh||1
Best regular and post season combined? I guess it depends how you look at it. Bulls lost less games (87-13) in their record season but Dubs won more (88-18) because they had the benefit of a 7 game 1st round series. \nI'd say an 87% winning season is better than an 83% winning season so to me the Bulls still hold the record for best combined season.||2
"Winningest" is more what I meant. 88 wins vs. 87.|Trail Blazers|1

They still have the championship from last year, I wouldn't feel bad for the Warriors right now. I feel bad for the Kings and Clippers and Supersonics (whoops I mean Thunder). It's been a great season of basketball and both the Warriors and ~~the Cavs~~ Lebron and Kyrie did something amazing this year.  Let's get a 3-peat of Warriors vs. ~~the Cavs~~ Lebron next year and see who can win the series of finals 2-1!

Not enough to put in Ezili and Varajeo who were terrible on offense and committed so many fouls.\n|Knicks|3
He put in Varajeo to help rebound, but forgot that all he does now is try to flop.  Hard to grab rebounds from Love when you're acting like Tyson just punched you everytime  he gets near'm.|Pistons|1

The 'let them play' philosophy is par for course, but it seriously ruins the quality of the games. Finesse players like KD and Curry get the short end of the stick, anyone who can give a hug or hold on to a jersey or hook an elbow can set a screen as well as the best screen setters in the league ([seriously doing a light moving screen properly is a skill](http://uproxx.com/dimemag/golden-state-warriors-illegal-screens/)).\n\nSeriously what other sport has different rules for the Championship vs the regular season?

Because of Bogut being out? Sure the Warriors being without him hurt but I would argue that it hurt no where near the amount that losing Kyrie and Kevin hurt the Cavs last year. I mean without Kyrie this year the Cavs probably get swept. ||1
I mean they could but what's 3 games versus 4 7 game series? New Orleans, Memphis, Houston and Cleveland were all missing starters. |Rockets|2

For someone without a dog in the fight, what a fuckin game. I wanted to see a repeat but in the end it makes no difference, I just wanted a close game. \n\nWell done Cleveland, well done LeBron, you deserve it.\n\nWe just watched history. This is some 30 for 30 material. God damn.|Raptors|3

What was the question?  I left the place where I was watching the game.||1
If when Lebron left, if he ever saw this (James coming back and winning one for Cleveland) coming. Like, what kind of answer was he supposed to give? He ended up saying he didn't hear her and rabbled more about how Cleveland deserved this.|Knicks|1
Thank you.||1

LeBron saved the game with that block. Kyrie sealed the game with that 3. I'll look back on this fondly 30 years from now. Long live King James. |Bucks|3

On a side note, how awesome is it that the first guy LeBron embraces at the buzzer is Kevin Love? For all the shit he got these finals (and throughout the year), he really is an integral part of this team. I, for one, hope he stays next year. Plus Lil Kev.|Cavaliers|3
He had a huge defensive possession against steph at the end. |Cavaliers|4
Enormous. I feel like his reputation as a terrible defender precedes him and everyone just shits on him all the time for it. Sure he's bad, very bad, at times. But I could definitely see improvement throughout most of the playoffs. Especially effort-wise he made great strides.|Cavaliers|1
Just a reminder, JR Smith and Iman Shumpert now have a ring. Think on that.|Cavaliers|3

If LeBron takes his talents back to South Beach again, they probably won't be burning his jerseys.||1
LeBron is home now. Cleveland would sell the Browns franchise and give the proceeds to him just to keep him here if necessary.||1
That. Was. So. Fucking. Good. \n\nWhen Lebron went down I was like noooooo.... Who am I kidding, if he broke his hand who gives a fuck just win and take some drugs to celebrate and enjoy his drinks on the beach with a cast. \n\nKyrieeeeeeeee I love you too. \n\nBut that last chase down block by Lebron though.

Hot damn he fucking did it.|Magic|3
By the way props to Draymond Green for two things:\n\n- This man single handedly kept alive the chances of Warriors winning. Whenever they were down he kept shooting 3s and driving down the basket sensibly to get them back. He even same amount of  3s of Steph and Klay combines, which says something. Because of him Oracle Arena had hopes to win this game, Curry and Klay both played awful and their offence was a let down most of the times.\n\n- Props to him to go LeBron after the game, congratulating him on this historic win and let's say make 'peace' between the two's bad blood all throughout the series. \n\nNow that NBA is done for couple more months, i don't know what the hell to do, guess i'll watch some WNBA :/|Celtics|3
He showed the heart of a competitor. I don't like his antics, but I love his spirit. |Knicks|2
Great heart and great player. Trust me on this, i don't know him personally but you can see it from every prospective apart from his antics he's a great dude and plays with heart and soul. Gave his everything today and if he wasn't around i bet the game would've been over late 3rd.|Celtics|1
I think it would've been over by half. He literally carried the team the whole way through. Any team would love a player like him. |Knicks|1
Literally anyone, i agree. Also, i agree on when the game would've been over. I said late 3rd thinking they were decent until 3rd started. After that every single player let Dre and Iggy down. These two single handedly kept this team alive. Honestly, God knows what would've happened if none of them played. Maybe a 110-60|Celtics|2
21-6-5 at half time are unreal numbers. Dude's a stud. |Knicks|1
Not sure if he had a triple double because he was shy of 2 assists in the 4th but if he carries on like this he'd be on another level for the coming seasons. Really though, i really feel bad for Iggy and Dre. I just do for some reason.|Celtics|1
32-15-9, one assist shy of being the fourth player ever to get a triple double in Game 7. |Knicks|1
What a tank he was. Only the W would have topped everything. Stats to remember for him but unfortunately not the right night to go with it.|Celtics|1
Lebron James is the best modern day basketballer.|Spurs|3

Your right. But I'll still take Lebron. ||1
Who wouldnt?||1
WE DID IT|Cavaliers|3
Congrats CAVS!|Knicks|3
this may be considered super reactionary, but who is the 2nd best player on these two teams for a play off series? Not who played best just now, but for any random playoff series. its LeBron easily, then who? Curry Green or Irving?|Suns|3
We can call it even for the excuse makers now. Cleveland fans were saying last year that GS won because Kyrie was hurt. This year GS fans can say Cleveland won because Curry has been playing hurt. The whining is almost as entertaining as the games themselves :)||3
When Irving sunk that three I peed myself with joy. That was the hangman's noose!||3
KEVIN LOVE WITH THE CHAMPIONSHIP BELT HAHAHA|[CLE] LeBron James|3

Klay was right when he said it's a man's league. |Celtics|3
Habitual testical knockers were always the bitchest kids on the playground. |Thunder|1
Everyone sitting here talking about LeBron's block or Kyrie's three. What about Tristan Thompson on the boards in the previous games? Without his hustle plays in games 5 and 6, there are no game 7 heroics.||3
One Of Fuck Dray's best game and ended in an L. Couldn't have asked for more!\n||3

I can't believe Cleveland took that series, but they fully deserved it. Played with such incredible passion and drive that just seemed to be lacking from the Warriors, and will hopefully return next season. James seriously earned that ring and he is a true champ.|Warriors|3

Just think how epic the 30 for 30 about this will be. Also I can't believe LeBron was unanimous mvp. I seriously thought Kyrie had a legit shot at getting it||3
No way Lebron doesn't get the FMVP in Cleveland's first championship with games 5 and 6.\n\nAn argument can definitely be made for Kyrie, but given the situation I don't think any voter wasn't going to vote for Lebron.|Grizzlies|1
I mean, LBJs back to back 41s and then a triple double kinda made it hard not to give it to him. He also basically averaged a triple double, but Kyrie was amazing this series, most fun player to watch score the ball|Suns|1
Cleveland fucking did it!!!!|Cavaliers|3

I don't know how to feel it's hard to take any credit away from LeBron but Kyrie was just as important||3
LeBron couldn't have done it himself - and that's not a knock on him.  No one could single handedly beat this warriors team.  All time great finals by both players. |[BOS] Kendrick Perkins|1
Don't disagree at all but if Iggy could win last year all things considered it just hurts to not show Kyrie love. He arguably won the game for them||1
27 year old Kyrie Irving will be a something to watch.\n\n\nI've always liked him but this series has solidified him as my favorite player outside my own team.  Human highlight reel|Spurs|3
WOW! What a performance by ~~Debbie Downer~~ Doris Burke to make a huge celebration into a funeral at the trophy presentation!!||3
Seriously||1
I don't think anyone outside of the Cleveland fanbase can truly appreciate this win in such a special way. It is breath taking and amazing. Thank you Lebron and the Cavs, and well played Golden State. You didn't go down without one hell of a fight. 'Til next season!|Cavaliers Bandwagon|3
I'm not from Cleveland, but I was cheering it on. I lived in Columbus and have been to Cleveland numerous times. I'm glad they got their win.  They needed it.||2

Two greatest Cavs plays were Kyrie's 3 and then LeBron's block in the last minute. What a fantastic and crazy game. Oh yeah, loved that Draymond came over and hugged LeBron.||3
That block will be one for the ages. That was the moment I was like, "Holy cow they\'re gonna do it." It\'s just a great visual of how LeBron refused to lose this series.|Pacers|2
Exactly man. Iggy probably was like this is going to be a super easy layup and then a 6'8 250lb monster came out of nowhere to destroy his dream.||1
Yeah, man. Maybe in replay it\'s not from as out of nowhere as it played in real time, but when watching live I thought it was a given he\'d either get two or a foul, and then, "My lord, how in the world did he even accelerate to get there let alone pick it clean? It\'s STILL TIED!"|Pacers|1
[Curry be like](http://i.imgur.com/l5kQi9M.jpg)|Knicks|3
It was just a difference of 4 points. 82 game season, followed by 4 rounds of playoff games, with a game 7.. and the only difference between them was 4 points. 4 points decided who was the champion. That's just insane. Had Irving missed that last 3, who knows what woulda happened.|Spurs|3
That was such a ballsy 3 and right in Curry's grill - just exposed the shitty defense that the team has been covering up... most over-inflated MVP in history. A true MVP plays defense.|Heat|1
I'm just excited for that picture from that woman who makes those great pictures. |Wizards|3

I'm from Austria, im happy u even understand me :D||1
This was the first ever basketball game I ever watched in full and it was electrifying, the rapid momentum shifts were exhilarating and LeBron James block was such a amazing fear given the stakes. This is the beauty of sports, it's seeing players etch their name in history and struggle to comprehend what they've done, it's LeBron James sinking to his knees and crying.\n\n\nI'm probably always going to be a casual basketball fan(as a tennis obsessive I can't allocate enough time to it) but I know I'll always cherish watching that final game.\n\nSports is an amazing and powerful force to show us the extraordinary beauty that comes from watching amazing talents attempt the improbable consistently. Throwing a ball into a hoop sounds simple and ordinary watching it when the game is tied with just over s minute remaining is magical||3

I think he's being a class act.

but he lived on the edge and it fueled him far beyond what he should be - I think he'll be back to being an average player next year with his fire quenched.

I disagree, he's one of the top few players in the league, a deserving double mvp, and partly due to pressure, partly due to the excellent play of the cavaliers, he's not been able to replicate his regular season form in the finals. |Knicks|1
That makeup moment between draymond and LeBron was beautiful. ||3
I am still on awe by all the hustle blocks Lebron James made. Godddddamn what a beast.|Lakers|3
I think this was a storybook ending designed specifically for Lebron's career by the gods:\n\n1. Playing for home town Cleveland after spurning it and then returning\n\n2. Against a 73-9 all time best regular season team\n\n3. On the road at enemy's homecourt\n\n4. Down 3-1 in Finals from which no team has ever come back to win\n\nand finally\n\nTo end championship drought in Cleve- at least we're not Detroit -land\n\nHis talent deserves something like this so the critics can finally be shut up||3
The prodigal son returned and then proceeded to shit all over his usurper.||1
One thing that distinguishes NBA basketball from almost any other sport is that players really can turn it on like a light switch in the postseason.  During any regular season since LeBron has returned to Cleveland, there have been stretches where the Cavs seem not just unwilling but incapable of playing even reasonable defense.  Yet in the postseason they always go to another level and hold even an offense like Golden State below a 100, or tonight even below 90.||3
I bet Mo Williams has already smoked three blunts by now.||3

Is Draymond the only one who actually congratulated Lebron and the team after the game? And Steph too?|Clippers|3
73-9*||3
Absolutely. Not ending it in a championship changes the conversation from arguably the best team of all time to just the most winningest regular season team.\n\nDon't get me wrong, the later is huge. But missing out on the former is rough. The likelihood of flirting with that again is slim to none.|Trail Blazers|1
If that dunk went in\xe2\x80\xa6my god |Hornets|3
Oh man. Now the Warriors have to break their own record next year and win the championship to finally shut the critics up! Now that the cavs have their title, I hope that they are happy with having to give it up for the next couple of years. ||3
Damn, K Love with the +19. Showed up when it mattered the most.|[SAS] Kawhi Leonard|3
JR Smith is from Freehold. Kyrie is from West Orange. Richard Jefferson played. As far as I'm concerned this is a win for New Jersey and the Nets|Nets|3
I hope Lebron's wrist is alright.  That can really stuff up his season.  ||3

kyrie misses a 2, golden state on a fast break for an easy 2 to take the lead, and lebron james does probably one of the most iconic defensive plays ever, and then kyrie drains a 3 in curry's face the very next possesion, and james knocks down the 1 ft he needs to\n\nboth james and kyrie deserve giant props, kyrie picked it up after game 2 and both he and lebron just carried fucking hard the last 3 wins\n\nlebron had some crazy plays on defense and big offensive nights in 5 and 6, kyrie was all time great offensively, unbelievable performances by both of them||3
I wanna see if any of the Cavs pull some drunk interviews off like Draymond and Klay did, throw some shade back their way a year later...|Kings|3

I was impressed with Steph's post-game interview how he refused all the softball questions about how he's really injured. Flat out said he's not getting surgery and has no physical excuses for his inconsistent play.\n\nI still struggle to believe that his merely-human performance in the last 14 games were the result of a regular-season-healthy Steph, but ya, they really figured out how to guard him and exploit the weaknesses of the Warriors seminal offense. \n\nCleveland was shockingly composed, poised, and clutch. Congrats.|USA|3
Super happy to all the Cleveland fans who have suffered for so long. Enjoy this night. Also proud of lebron for going against the grain and doing it his way. The way the Cavs beat history tonight will never be forgotten. Very cool story all around. |Heat|3

Hard to find the words. Incredible game. But also an incredible series and an incredible playoffs (well, the West anyway), and also an incredible season. \n\nIn ~15 years of being an NBA fan, this ranks as one of the best years of basketball ever for me.\n\nLebron has firmly cemented his place on the mt. rushmore and forever shuts down the doubters and the haters, you have to look very long and hard to find anything to say against what he\'s done at this point and for all we know he still has a lot more left to say. In particular though, he got it done in key moments. All three blocks were huge. A huge three pointer and icing it with a free throw after apparently damaging his arm. \n\nCurry meanwhile was mostly a non-factor, particularly when it counted most, and the Warriors overall have a \'did they choke?\' vibe that will perennially live alongside "But they lost" to cap their otherwise historic season.\n\nLebron was certainly deserving of FMVP, though enough good words can\'t be said for Kyrie Irving\'s performance. Even when the Warriors played great defense against him, and realistically, there were plenty of moments where they did, but his offense was just better. Time and time again. In a few years, methinks Irving will have something to prove a la Kobe post-Shaq. \n\nBut I think the most remarkable thing was how Kevin Love not only played a great game for his 30 minutes but it was his defense on Curry in the clutch that really sealed it for the Cavs. \n\nToo good. ||3
Damn, JR!|[CLE] LeBron James|3

Congratulations, Cavs fans. Seriously, Lebron and Kyrie were out of their minds those last 3 games, and even though it stings like a mofo now, I'm happy for Cleveland.

[Me, upon returning to my apartment after watching game 7.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdZzlV9rnzE)\n\n...seriously. I've cried like three times tonight.\n\n|Cavaliers|3
Nobody from the Warriors showed up except for Draymond and Iggy. I prayed for Curry to change his game plan and not foolishly throw silly passes but he did. We forced Cleveland to throw bad passes but they didn\'t force Curry to do terrible ones like the behind the back to out of bounds. You could even tell from Klay\'s reaction "GOD DAMN IT."\n\nIt was frustrating to see #30 still thinking he could play like he did in the regular season. I know I shouldn\'t be blaming players but man Steph, he didn\'t show up. He was probably the only one who couldn\'t adjust. That\'s the truth. Kevin Love, the one guy who literally did nothing the whole series, even suffering a concussion, came out and defended the hell out of him. \n\nIdk. I guess we got lucky we didn\'t get blown out at HOME IN A GAME 7 cuz Cavs bricked their 3s. Otherwise, it would have been a repeat of games 5 & 6. \n\nGGs Cleveland. On to the next one for us.||3
Steph is weak-minded when it comes down to it, the Cavs showed him what's up. It was a great series and I'll never forget this magical run. |Cavaliers|3
He should've settled for driving and kicking out passes to open teammates more when he knew his 3s weren't falling. Literally what he did in the regular season but didn't happen here.\n\nWhile I don't like LeBron for his self-entitled eminence, it was kind of heartwarming to see him down on the ground like that after the buzzer. Reminded me of Isaiah Thomas in the 80s (only cuz I watched 30 for 30 lol). \n\nI'll hold fast to the 73-9 all my life but this year belongs to you guys. ||0
I'm definitely going to remember 2016 as a historic year for basketball.|Nuggets|3
People have wanted LeBron to take over a series in an all-time great sort of way for years...he did that this series. He was unbelievable. Congrats to the Cavs, what an incredible performance. Never say die. |Pelicans|3

Watching Kevin Love play defense on Curry in that last minute was inspiring. Makes you realize how much these guys half ass it during most of the season on the defensive end.||3
True, but it's not really possible to play at that level for an entire regular season. Well, unless your name is Russell Westbrook. I really wouldn't be surprised if the Warriors kept putting up big regular season numbers but fail to win many championships for that reason. ||1

"I think we\'re in a great situation for game 8. Who wouldn\'t want to be in this position?" - Steve Kerr||3
This all feels like justice after seeing one of Draymonds post game interviews last year when he very unprofessionally said the Cavs suck... He may have had a good game, and they had a great regular season but it all means nothing, hopefully we can all calm down on how "great" Curry is now, he offers nothing more then a fantastic jump shot. No post game, hardly a good defender, can\'t rebound and when it counted most the "unanimous" mvp was no where to be seen. Fuck steph curry\n||3
Well, its hard to say that about him. He had a fantastic, historic season. He hit ridiculous shots all year with world class handles and made the finals for the seconod year in a row. And he and the Warriors bought a joy to the league and came within a whisker of winning it all. \n\nHe has a lot to improve on, and I think, if we know anything about his incredible work ethic, he WILL improve next year. ||1
That wasn't post-game that was post parade. ||1

That's ridiculous. A team wins a championship every year. Only one team in history has won 73 games in the regular season.

I have. To support the cavs in game 4. Left with a broken windshield after getting stuck at a green light in an intersection. ||0
Seriously though, has anyone ever said, damn, I should take a vacation to Cleveland .||8
yea! joakim noah said exactly that|Spurs|1

We probably will never see a team make a 3-1 finals game 7 win comeback ever again. What a game, this one is one to remember forever. The last time the finals were won on the road in game 7, the Wizards were the Baltimore Bullets and Wes Unsled was mvp.||7

Holy shit...the big 3 of Cleveland showing up at the end. That block by James, defense by Love on Curry, and that clutch ass shot by Kyrie. Congratulations Cleveland!||5
We just witnessed the greatest game ever played within the greatest series ever played.\n\nYou did it, LeBron. You got one for The Land.|Heat|7

Not every time. Sometimes Republicans win after the East has won, but Democrats have only won after the East wins. Oddly enough, I believe this year won't be an exception.|Nuggets|1
Lebron and his daughter are cute rn.\n\nDoes anyone know if him and his wife are not as close, or he likes keeping her distant from media, I haven't seen her yet unless I missed it|Heat|5
I think just away from media||4
That's what I figured |Heat|1
For what it's worth, right after he got up from the floor after the final buzzer, he started asking where his wife was.||5
Awesome |Heat|2
She stays out of the spotlight. Drama free unlike ayesha|Cavaliers|4
He asked for his wife once he got off the floor crying. She doesn't seek attention.||9
[AHA!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0N1nSU0exI)|[CLE] LeBron James|1
After this series I can't be a fan of Klay Thompson. |[NYK] Kristaps Porzingis|4
What why? Lebron did get his feelings hurt. Lebrons still a bitch.|Mavericks|-1
Klay got his feelings hurt twice in a row. |[LAL] Magic Johnson|1
Didn't get to watch the game yet, but how come? Missed a ton of shots?||1
Even with all the shit between Draymond Green and Lebron, Draymond went over to congratulate Lebron after the game. So did Steph I think, among other GSW players I'm sure.\n\nKlay left without a word. No respect.|Clippers|2
He left before the buzzer blew and went and cried in the locker room|[WAS] John Wall|2
Not only that. The other day, he was saying "I guess he[Lebron] got his feelings hurt."\n\n\nThe game before that he was complaining about a screen by Mozgov. Then all the shit he did after. Dudes straight up a sore loser. |[NYK] Kristaps Porzingis|2
So Lebron is now 3-4 at 31 years old and hasn't really showed any sign of slowing down. With Kyrie developing into a superstar I don't think 5 or maybe even 6 rings is out of reach for Lebron|NBA|6
I'm so drunk. I'm so crying|[CLE] J.R. Smith|7
All y'all Lebron haters can SHUT THE FUCK UP NOW!!!!! |Hawks|12
Why? Curry lost the game. Lebron didn't win it. Kyrie did. ||-9
Yeah, even without lebron the cavs would have won it because Kyrie won it by himself \n\n*Eyeroll*|Heat|6
if Lebron wouldn't have made that block happen, the Warriors would win the championship.|Hawks|6
They should've shut up after Game 6 in Boston. This is the feather in his cap now. Everything else is an epilogue. |Magic|1

#FUCK DRAYMOND GREEN|Cavaliers Bandwagon|57
Why? Lol|Raptors|-8
Probably because he kicked a dude in the nuts. |Bulls|3
And punched a dude in the nuts. Which got him the flagrant required to suspend him. ||4
I don't like him nor do I hate him||1
I upvoted this you have my support||2
I agree, fuck Draymond Green, but I'll be damned if he didn't play out of his skull tonight. He was the only reason the game was close.|Cavaliers|4
I am on my couch speechless and in near tears. 31 years of my life and a championship for Cleveland.  FUCKING YES||6
CURRY A BITCH|Supersonics|8
I don't think there's any doubt as to who the best player in the league is at this point.  I wonder though, in terms of ranking the NBA players, where does Stephen Curry fall now?  He was outplayed in both the CLE and OKC series by the opposing PG, and in my opinion it was his defense that was constantly exposed in the final 3 games of the CLE series that ultimately allowed CLE to win the title.  CLE kept going to the pick and roll to get Curry in the action, and more times than not, he was unable to stop either Irving or Lebron.  I don't think any other top player in the league would have that much trouble defending both a PG and a SF.  Heck, even Tristan Thompson, a Center, did a MUCH better job on a top PG than Curry did. \n\nI might be overreacting a bit, but at this point my personal NBA player rankings go:\n\n1.  Lebron James\n\n2.  Kevin Durant\n\n3.  Kawhi Leonard\n\n4.  Russell Westbrook\n\n5. Anthony Davis\n\n6. Stephen Curry\n\nThat honestly might still be too high for Curry...\n\n|Grizzlies|6
I still might put Curry and Draymond Green ahead of Davis and possibly Westbrook.  They were the major contributors on getting their team to the finals.|Heat|-5
No way Draymond Green is a top-6 player.  He's far too inconsistent offensively.  He'll have nights like last night where he's on fire, but then he'll have entire series like against OKC where he's ice cold.  He had back-to-back games against OKC where he went 1-9 and then 1-7.  It was similar against Cleveland.  He went 2-8 in Game 3 and and 2-9 in Game 4.  He also can't really create his own shot and he isn't a force in the post, which, to me, greatly limits his ranking.    \n\nDraymond is obviously great, and arguably in the top 15 or 20, but he's not in the top-6 or above Westbrook or Davis.\n\nAnd I gave my reason for Curry's relatively low ranking above.  I just don't see how you can put Curry ahead of Westbrook at this point.  Defending is half of the game, and it's apparent that Curry's defense is not at the same level of other top players.\n\n    \n\n\n|Grizzlies|2
Curry is number 2 even though they choked hard. |Cavaliers|0
Curry has incredible talent - but he choked hard in these Finals - if I'm Golden State - I still feel great with him on my team, but how he shrunk away from the challenge is cause for concern. I think we need to consider Kyrie Irving for this list as well.|Cavaliers|1
No doubt...I have Curry at 6, and Golden State has surrounded him with incredible players.  Thompson, Draymond Green, Iguodola, Bogut, Barnes, and Livingston are all really good players, with Thompson and Green also probably being top-20 players.\n\nGolden State will be title contenders (and possibly favorites) as long as they can keep the Curry, Thompson, Green trio alive.|Grizzlies|1
Hahahahahaha  fuck curry fuck clay fuck Drayton and most importantly fuck all you bandwagoning  warriors fans. |Timberwolves|15
get fucked you piece of shit warriors bandwdagoners. im so happy about this outcome. so fucking happy. get fucked.|Timberwolves|7
I don't care what anyone says. Lebron is the greatest of all time. Jordan never carried a team through a 3-1 deficit in the finals. |Cavaliers|8
Jordan never allowed his team to ever be down 3-1 in the Finals in the first place.||1
Technically..nobody has. Until tonight that is.||2

I did not expect Kyrie Irving to outplay Curry as badly as he did. I honestly think Kyrie showed he is the better overall player. He can do more than shoot 3s and doesn't need to be hidden on defense .||5

Can someone point me out why LeBron got the MVP award instead of Kyrie? I think he deserved the award.|Bulls|3
Yea dude, this is a sweep in the other direction without the greatest player of all time||1
LeBrons legacy, back-to-back 41 point elimination games, chase down blocks. I think they both deserved it but if it came down to it I think even Kyrie would say LeBron deserves it more. In fact Kyrie said something after the game saying that's why he won Finals MVP and is the best on the planet.|Clippers|1
Uhhh. Points, rebounds, assists, steals and blocks. Lebron is the first player to lead a playoff series in all of these categories. He's also the third player to have a triple double in game 7.||1
Yes I sure can:\nPer game averages: 29.7 pts, 11.3r, 8.9a, 2.6s, 2.3b\n\nanything else?|Knicks|2
Yeah I think that's it. I don't closely follow player stats to be honest.|Bulls|1
I dislike both teams cuz I'm a Knicks fan and lets face it I'm supposed to be miserable... but what Lebron did this series made me legitimately believe he deserved Finals MVP regardless of who won, and I previously believed only the winning team should be considered for Finals MVP.\n\nWhen you actually think a player is having a bad game, then see he has 22p 10a and 9r with like 9 to go in the game you gotta start considering how lucky we are to be watching this guy. \n\nAnd I'm not denying how incredible Kyrie was the last few games. |Knicks|1
Kyrie played incredibly and he was the best player on the court that wasn't named lebron James. Back to back 41 point games and a triple double in game 7 will get you finals MVP. |76ers|2
41, 41, and a triple double |Rockets|5

Klay Thompson is a fucking bitch ass loser, for real though|[SAC] Oscar Robertson|5
Kyrie is only 24 years old and he just completely outplayed the back to back and unanimous MVP the entire serires, the sky is the limit for this guy|NBA|4
Not to take anything away from Kyrie because he was outstanding but Steph was coming off a 73 win season, injuries in the first round, Lillard the second round, and Durant and Westbrook in the conference finals. That is a tough road for any player. |[PHI] Allen Iverson|-3
Hopefully kyrie will no longer be disrespected. He is no doubt a top 5 point guard in the league.|Cavaliers|1

Kyrie, you da real MVP.|76ers|5
I don't think there is anything Curry can do to win an MVP again.  After the year he had with all those gawdy numbers and the first unanimous MVP in league history he still lost the Finals.  No way will NBA voters make him MVP again after embarrassing them like this. |Suns|4
Regular season and playoffs are totally different. He deserved MVP. Yes, he was lacking during the playoffs but he was dominant this season. Just like LeBron deserved that Finals MVP. |76ers|1
I'm not saying he didn't deserve it.  I'm saying the voters won't vote him again.  He may deserve it again in the future, but he won't get voted MVP.|Suns|1
Curry choked hard ...||4
What happened to Curry was that Cleveland was not going to let him beat them. It was Cleveland's game plan every night to make someone else on the Cavs beat them. It was a very risky gamble, but it paid off. I honestly don't think they had another way to approach the series that gave them as good a chance to win. Steph didn't choke, the Dubs got outplayed.  |Celtics|1
Congratulations Cleveland. I'd be enjoying this if you had beaten anyone else. |Warriors|5

The historic finals victory with the true MVP. \n\nDamn finally we get to see a Cleveland team bring it home. \n\nI guess a health Kyrie and love made a difference. I wonder what last year would have looked like with them healthy. No need to wonder anymore. |Cavaliers|6
Man, I should be fucking angry right now. But for whatever reason, I can't help but feeling happy for LeBron. They fought their way back down from 3-1, and came out and played their hearts out. I have nothing but respect for the Cavaliers. I hate that my Warriors will be shitted on for the next year or so, but fuck it. We went 73-9 and Stephen Curry was the unanimous MVP. I'm just happy that we are all witnessing great things happen, this has to be one of the greatest Playoffs and Seasons of all time. |Warriors|7

You know what? Fuck it. You truly earned this, LeBron. Live it up, man.||2

LEBRON'S WRIST DIED FOR THIS. |Rockets|2
Fuck, how can I hate Green when he is a good sport after this?|[CLE] LeBron James|2
SO many GSW players just disappeared, Varajao, Barnes, Curry, etc.  Felt like crazy mistakes, allowing James to land on you, turn overs, slowing the game down on fast break opportunities, etc.||2
I'm as big of a bandwagon warriors fan as there is, but once that whistle blew I wasn't bitter anymore. life is so much better when you realize that you have witnessed greatness and that you should just enjoy it instead of\nfighting it. bravo lebron and kyrie, fucking bravo|Bulls|2
Jesus. SO much hype. So dramatic. After Kobe's farewell I did not think we'd ever see anything so beautiful. Incredible. ||2
The choke is real. The dream is dead ||2
JR smith crying got to me bruh I wanna cry too ||2
Lebron crying cause his back hurts so much. I'm not even mad right now, great series. Had me on edge the whole game. Well played Cleveland. Enjoy the trophy :)|Warriors|2
Anyone notice how fast Klay walked out to the locker room. Come on man. You can't talk all that shit and then bail out as soon as you face defeat. Gotta eat some crow and come back next year|Celtics|2

Good game, tough loss. LeBron is a beast.\n\nWith that being said, fuck all the fuck bois in this thread. |Warriors|2
I love Steph but he was contained by the Cavs, unfortunately. I think he's gotta learn to drive to the hoop and shoot mid range shots more. Still played great, but not at the level he could normally play. I have to give LeBron and Kyrie all the credit in the world.\n\nI love the Warriors but Cavs deserved this. What a series.||2
Truth of it is that steph can't play physical ball. That's why I a lot of people expect him to fall off. A jumpshooter can't carry a team to a finals victory (and it was evident that he didn't carry them last year either)||1
I mean he did carry them last year except for game 2 and game 3. But I agree that he struggled with the physical play and how damn good Cleveland's defense is. I mean Tristan Thompson makes their defense imo.\n\nI think Steph fell too in love with the 3 and lost confidence in his mid-range shot and his driving. Steph needs a floater.||1
Well played Cleveland.  See you next year. |[GSW] Stephen Curry|2
And he did it without HGH|Knicks|2
I was rooting for GS, so disappointed in the outcome. But damn that was a good game 7. And I'm happy because, although they missed a few calls both ways, the refs finally officiated a pretty good game. It would have been a shame to have another awful officiated game. Great game and hell of a game winner by Kyrie.||2

Draymond Green is someone I've never been a massive fan of in personality or his play but tonight he was legit. And to see him give LeBron props after a game 7 loss? I've gained a great deal of respect for him and his game after tonight|Bucks|2
Happy for Kyrie. I'm sad obviously, but congrats Cleveland... Lets do it again next year.|Warriors|2
As a Bulls fan rooting for the Warriors in the Finals, I have nothing but respect for LeBron. Earned every bit of this moment. Congrats to the Cavs! Watch out, we have four rivalry games with you guys next year! Looking forward to them!|Bulls|2

I find it hilarious that the team with the best regular season title of all time lost in the finals and up 3-1 in the series |Rockets|2

Lebron could run for president right now and I'm pretty sure Cleveland would vote for him.|Cavaliers|2
Kevin Love with some fantastic minutes, particularly that last defensive play against Curry.|Cavaliers Bandwagon|2
In a game thread this year for OKC v. CLE (the first game of the regular season series) I posted a comment saying Durant was the best small forward in the NBA. Now after watching Durant choke and Lebron step up, I rescind my statement. \n\n^I ^still ^love ^you ^kd|Thunder|2
But wait....if the cavs had love and Irving last year, no chance they could have won....||2
Yeah the east is so weak that's the only reason they made it|Celtics|2

Shout out to all the people on this sub claimed the series was over 3-1|Lakers|2
Congrats Cleveland. The passion at the end says it all. fwiw I hate LeBron and every team he plays on but fuck if I'm going to sit here and deny him this. Totally deserved. What a great player. Second best ever IMO. LeBron's going to get all the plaudits but I hope what doesn't get lost amongst it all is just how fucking good Kyrie is. The fact he's still only 24 is scary. \n\nOne thing I'd add for GSW is that the possession from Curry after Kyrie's 3 was an absolute disgrace. You're down 3 with like a minute left. Run a fucking play. Do something. Don't just run around the 3 point line with a big glued onto you then throw up a prayer. I couldn't believe that. |Celtics|2
Curse is broken!!||2

It was a tight game, and we had a home court advantage. Congratulations Cleveland Cavaliers!||2

Fuck Adam silver ||2
I didn't know the Warriors liked to be choked while they were fucked. |Jazz|2
Lebron only the 3rd player ever with a game 7 triple double.  The other two are solid HOFers Jerry West and James Worthy.   So happy for Cleveland but much happier that Jordan's Bulls are still the best team ever.||2
Wow. Seriously what a game. You could see the burden lifted off Lebron's shoulders. So great for him and Cleveland. ||2
Cleveland still sucks though right?|Bulls|2
Be careful when you get off the wagon, bandwagon fans.|Thunder|2
Lebron just scored over 200 points in a Finals while leading his team to the only 3-1 comeback ever and it was against the best regular season team ever. You want to talk about adding to your legacy, I mean how do you top that? |Supersonics|2

I'm not a fan of LeBron, you might even call me a hater... but there's no denying he played OUT OF THIS WORLD these last 3 games and deserves all the credit he's going to get for bringing a championship to Cleveland.  Kyrie deserves MAJOR props too. \n\nFuck my neighbor though who won't stop shouting.  Enjoy the huge win, but fuck you man it's bedtime. |Celtics|2
the booing is actually so sad. when the Raptors lost, absolutely no booing. wow the salt. |Raptors|2

What's wrong with Gilbert ||1
Until he lucked into Lebron, he just used the team as a revenue generator and didn't give a shit about their success. Then after lebron went to Miami, he treated him like shit and cast all kinds of shade. Now he's acting like he deserves all the credit |Raptors Bandwagon|2
Oh shit. TIL ||1
What will the Warriors be more remembered for? 73-9 or 32-1?|Mavericks|2

What a great game. Not usually a squeaky shoes fan, but that was terrific. I've been a diehard MJ is the greatest, person, but I think this win makes it a legit argument for Lebron. He's won with the super team, like MJ, but now he's won with Cleveland. ||2

This Cavs team makes me think of the 1995 Cowboys. This was a team that played hard nosed, and got a one seed, but so much excitement was around all these other teams, and the Cavs had to really deal with mostly scrutiny from a franchise standpoint.|Heat|2

I honestly don't know if I've seen such a mismatch of players defended so well in such a high-stakes moment. Kevin had no chance, but that man put his SOUL into guarding Steph. What a great job. Everything Cleveland paid him was worth it on 1 possession. Everyone on the Cavs gave it everything that they had, but I feel that Kevin's defensive effort shouldn't go unnoticed.|[NOP] Anthony Davis|3
I seriously feel so privileged to have seen all of that. Kyrie's shot will be one of the greatest in history. |Bulls|2

LeBron ain't letting go of those trophies.|Hawks|2
Congratulations to the Cavaliers. Truly incredible performances by them with their backs against the wall for three straight games. \n\nAlternatively, the Warriors were a win away for three straight games, and lost the final one by just four points. Two baskets. Decided in the last minute. That's going to haunt them for the rest of their lives. I wish them the best of luck in recovering from that, and I can't wait to see what they do next year, along with the Cavs. \n\nWith that, the offseason begins!!!!|NBA|2
20 years ago I sat on my couch and watched MJ do the impossible.  \n\n20 years from now I don't know where I will be but I'll remember this day. \n\nIt's just amazing to see this kind of performance from a player. ||2

I agree. Kyrie should have got the MVP.||1
Most stacked crowd I've ever seen after the visiting team won the title.\n\nDid they already start trading in their shirts?|Spurs|2
Perfect time for the Warriors to shit the bed for 3 games in a row and get their first 3 game losing streak.|Heat|2

I'm in shock and I don't know what to do with myself!!!!! |Cavaliers|2
Real.|Cavaliers|2
Amazing game,but when it all came down to the wire and both teams were basically throwing up bricks for solid 2 minutes,Kyre Irving just came through with one of the most cold blooded 3s I've seen in my life.\nI dont want to deminish what Lebron has done for his team,but when he tried to take over the game it just didn't happen scoring wise.\nCurry,Thompson,Green all got heavy handed and Kyre just gave absolute 0 fucks,0 and sank that thing like it was a FT.\n\nGz to cleveland good game.|Spurs|2
I'm so fucking happy right now.\n\nAlso, the Cleveland Police Scanner is chaos.||2

I'm going to go ahead and take this time to repent and admit that Lebron is one of the greatest players in history. Im not ready to say he's the goat but he's top 3 for me. \nGo ahead and check my recent post history. \n\nThe way he never gives up on plays and his incredible defensive presence not to mention his godly offensive skillset. \n\nLet's not forget about Kyrie though, Lebron and Kyrie had an amazing series and together carried the Cavaliers to victory.\n\nCongratulations Cleveland and the fans of The Cavs.|Knicks|2
glad to see they are still having bill russell on the stage for this. it will be a sad day when whe's no longer there to see his trophy presented|[OKC] Russell Westbrook|2
As a Miami fan, I seriously could not be happier for Lebron. Guy earned every second of this triumph and I wish he and Cleveland many more. Just happy to have gotten to see him play against so many incredible teams and players, first the titanic battles with the Spurs and now with Golden State. Some of the most epic basketball games ever.|Spurs|2
I CAN'T EXPRESS HOW HAPPY I AM.  |Cavaliers|2

Harrison Barnes is actual trash, I don't know what happened to that guy.|Lakers|2
The Cavs defense to close out this series was absolutely superb.  How many thought the Warriors were the most feared team on the fast break, yet in game 7 it was Cleveland who owned almost all the fast break points.  And they disrupted Klay Thompson and Steph Curry all game long including shutting out the Warriors the game's last 4 minutes.||2

I can't decide if the play of that game was Kyrie's three or Klove! lock down defense with 30 seconds left.|Cavaliers|2
YES!!!!!! CLEVELAND!!!!! FINALLY!!!!||2
As much as I dislike Lebron, he really did put the team on his shoulder and just ran over Warriors, he was incredibly defensively all series along, it's been a while since we witness such defensive efforts from him.\n\nWarriors on the other hand just became the greatest choke of all time in NBA.||2
What a great game. Great season.||2
I remember game 1 and 2.. I was like wtf.. I never thought this could be possible. Just insane||2

Did Doris ignore Love?  Didn't even interview him.  Also did Smith refer to himself as a young guy in comparison to Lebron?  Arent they roughly the same age?|Nets|2
I'm not a cavs fan nor warriors fan but god damn i am so freaking happy the cavs won they completely deserve it (in reality thunder should have been in the finals to begin with) so as a thunder fan I am ecstatic that they were avenged and lebron fulfilled the promise of bringing a championship to the land and he did it in some fashion by posting a triple double. Next season the thunder are going to make it to the finals there is no doubt in my mind they definitely have what it takes the only thing is that they have to stay healthy for the entirety of the next season. On behalf of the thunder fan base I pray that KD stays (which he probably will) at OKC and brings us a title that he has been longing for. THUNDER UP 2017 |Supersonics|2
Why was Ezeli out there at all? First 2 possessions of the game he's got the ball for GS, both times he fucks it up. That's 4 points. Could have been the difference. Why not just put any of your other guys out there.|Raptors|2
And the axel has come off the bandwagon |Wizards|2

Was going for Curry big time, I'm a Raps fan but I'm such a big fan of the renaissance of the 3 in the NBA, I've never been a LeBron guy since The Decision bs, and I wanted to see a historic season capped off, but that was a really, really great game.\n\nUp 3-1 in the finals with home advantage and having not lost 3 straight in years. Damn it must hurt right now to be a real GSW fan.||2
King James earned his nickname with this series without a fucking doubt. This means so many things for his legacy. What a legendary game.|Raptors|2

The way gsw barrage you with the 3 point shooting is not the same after having played 3 or 4 consecutive games. You adjust, you know much better how to defend that 3pointer.

Maybe in a few years but he's not Michel fucking Jordan. Jordan also has SIX finals mvps.|Spurs|2
He is the best of this generation but he has a huge mountain to climb before being called the GOAT.||1

Each of the big three of Cleveland made a huge play down the stretch.  LeBron's block, Kyrie's 3, KLove's d on Curry.  The team with the two best players won and made the nuts plays when it mattered.||2
Cleveland just got Reddit gold but in real life ||2

What did they change his to? So disappointing |Hawks|1
Stupor changed it to - Dan bets nothing and if Cleveland lost, Stugotz would shave his hand. It was lame, Stugotz really didn't want the piercing and he knew Dan really didn't want to pose||1
Greatest series of all time|Bulls|2

The pre-game hype video that was all about inches.  This game man.  That Lebron block was an inch from being a goaltend and was one of the nastiest chase downs I've seen.||2
Time for gsw locker room to smell like champagne. ||2
With the season over, I assume now we can only expect top-quality discussion here in r/nba.|Mavericks|2
All I can say is Lebron Motherfucking James||2

That lebron chase down block gonna haunt all the dubs wagon fans for like 3 weeks|Raptors|2

Wow now that it's all over my Lebron hate goggles are off and this is incredible he earned this championship with blood, sweat and tears.|Warriors|2

LeBron can't even manage to average a triple-double in the NBA finals? What a has-been|Kings|2
I don't think the NBA is rigged But after those last three games I would not be surprised if Barnes in particular was paid off /s\n\nI've never been so mad to see a player continually get minutes throughout a series that he is bombing so hard\n\nWell my Mavericks failed me so I started watching Golden State and now they filled me so that means I have to buy a Kyrie Irving or Lebron James jersey now right?\n\nSpeaking of the Mavericks if they are the ones that offer Barnes and Max contract next year I might just switch to MLB||2
Well, Curry certainly fucked that one.||2
lebron deserves the circlejerk that is coming this summer|Heat|2
I wonder how mad the GSW bandwagon is..\n\n"It don\'t mean a thing without the ring" \n\nOn top of being up 3 games to 1..||2
Baseball on ESPN right now? Are they fucking serious? Move that to The Ocho jesus christ the Cavs just made history.|[CLE] LeBron James|2
I hope Cleveland uses this championship win in their tourism brochures. I can see it now, "Cleveland, home of the 2016 NBA Champions". |Raptors|2
This is peak Lebron. Nothing he can do will EVER top this. As someone who grew up in Ohio, witnessed the 80s Browns, this means something for me. Even though the Cavs aren't my #1 team it still feels really nice. \n\nCongrats Lebron, the Cavs team, the Cav fans and all of Ohio. If you're going to break a curse you couldn't do it anymore dramatic. 30 for 30 or hell one day a hit movie. \n\nLebron vs Jordan? Who cares? Both are amazing players and I am glad I got to watch both. |Clippers|2
He's going to quit and go to the Browns. Kevin Love will also go and play QB and Lebron will play tight end.\n\nThe first season will be rough, but they will win a superbowl in season three||1
That Ezeli substitution in the fourth quarter was a really poor decision by Kerr. He overthought it and paid for it. Ezeli gave up some big plays and did nothing on the offensive end.|Suns|2
I am sitting on my couch crying like a baby right now and just cant stop. Please dont wake me if this is a dream!!!|Cavaliers|2
I just want to say that as a staunch Lebron "hater" that I\'m glad he got one in Cleveland.  Only thing comparable was when Peyton finally won one in 09.  Hate turning into respect.|Celtics|2
72 win Bulls got a ring to go with it. LOLOLOL Warriors|Bulls|2
Curry with so many unnecessary 3 pointers cost GSW. ||2

Congrats to Cleveland, you guys fought and endure half a century plus for this moment. Congrats Lue. Congrats to the players for never giving up. \n\nWarriors, not gonna sugar coat it. Y'all chocked. You are never entitled to a championship, no matter how historic you are. ||2
It's been a long time since I've cried this much...|Cavaliers|2
Probably the most amazing finals win ive seen. Down 3-1 with game 7 on the road. Incredible.|Raptors|2
Kevin love in the Austin 3:16 shirt OMG lmfaoooo ||2
The Warriors are equivalent to the Seahawks now. A lot of bandwagoners with back to back failures. |Bucks|2
Back to back fails? Ony one fail really. And just like the Seahawks, the Warriors have had a strong and dedicated fan base since way before they where good|Trail Blazers|0

I've actually never been this happy for any sports team that wasn't mine. I love just about everyone on Cleveland, that team seems to be filled with just genuinely good people. Also as a fan of Kevin Love it was nice to see him play well today, shouts out to that defense he played on Curry. |Trail Blazers|2
I DONT KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH MY HANDS|Cavaliers|2
http://imgur.com/ZfCh4Pu|Bulls|1
I was in as much the same corner of things as anyone proclaming the series over after game 2. Saying LeBron couldn't win without his teammates defending worth a snot.\n\nEveryone chipped in with big plays in this game.\n\nAnd truthfully, the Warriors ran out of gas first. A narrative will spark up about whether going for the record doomed them once they'd locked up the #1 seed. They looked absolutely drained. Rare to see that from both sides of a game.|Pelicans|2
Thanks Obama!||2
I seriously hope I get to feel what Cav fans are feeling with my chargers one day. |Lakers|2
I'm a pats fan but I genuinely like the Chargers and hope rivers and gates get one before their done. |Spurs|1
The Warriors finally lost their third game in a row.||2

It's such a dumb story. Waste your energy worrying about it if you want. |[PHI] Julius Erving|1
I'm not worried about it at all. Glad he got Cleveland a Championship.|Celtics|1
He had 27/11/11 tonight and I've seen some people calling it a bad game by Lebron.\n\nHe almost had a triple double for the entire series with like 30/13/9 or something for the series. A crazy 7 game statline.|Grizzlies|1
People will find absolutely any reason to shit on Lebron. I'm done talking to people like that, you can't reason with them.|Celtics|1
Lebron has passion I will give you that. ||2
And skill, and everything else||2
I'M FINALLY NEAR A STRONG SIGNAL AND WATCHED A LITTLE OF THE THIRD QUARTER IN MY PHONE BUT LISTEN TO THE REST IN THE CAR RADIO AND ALL I HAVE TO SAY IS FUCK YES THAT'S HOW YOU FUCKING END IT!!!!!! |Heat|2
He towered over curry, I think curry had no idea what to do.||2
I think Harrison Barnes lost about $50 million in this series|Celtics|2
Uhhh, I think celebrating fans may have stolen a fire truck...||2
I counted them out at every turn but Im so fucking happy. Lebron isnt better than Jordan. He's a different player from a different era. To me, Coming from someone who has seen MJ, Kobe, and LBJ? Who cares!!! I love good BB. And tonight just solidified everything and made me the happiest single, sober, non-cav fan, but also a Lebron fan one can be.||2
Kyrie had the most satisfying three at the end |Spurs|2
Guys, please, someone make a new hoist it video. The new one sucks, honestly. Game 3 hoist it was soooo good. Someone be a hero and save hoist it. ||2

Give it to Ty Lue, he had to navigate some difficult decisions.... **GIVE IT LEBRON, THE COACH, THE GM, THE FMVP, AND THE GOAT**||2
Unbelievable. This is a new high. I have never. ..|Cavaliers|2
One of the coolest plays I've ever seen - and I want to see pictures of this - was that block green had on LeBron. Man that play just showed so much effort by both players willing their teams to a victory. LeBron drove to the rim incredibly hard while green went for the block counterbalancing LeBron momentum and not trying to foul. \n\nReminds me of that d Wade KD commercial from a couple years ago|Timberwolves|2
To put it kindly, I am not a Draymond fan, but my god, that guy put everything he had into this game. Awesome effort, gotta respect the man, dick punches and all|Celtics|2
I have a feeling GSW and Cavs will be like Lakers and Celtics ||2

There's always next year. 73-9 is cool.

Feel like Lebron was too, kinda, in the beginning. Lots of jumpers he didn't take but passed out instead? But still great playing by Lebron.|Clippers|2
i agree, there was timidness in lebron's decision-making although he constantly got the offense in a position to have a quality possession (albeit the cavs did struggle with the shot clock.)  |San Diego Clippers|1
Everybody leaving the Golden state bandwagon now ||2
This was such a great series, both amazingly talented teams,  and a phenomenal Game 7!  Was rooting for the King but deep down I wanted this win for Cleveland.  Celebrate Cleveland, the trophy is coming home!  |Celtics|2

my little cousin who is 9 years old almost caught 5 to the face, can you imagine the emotions i went through as this man said "I\'m here to give you bad luck, hope cleveland loses", fml, this is the most animosity i have ever felt for my little cousin, had to stay classy and act like he wasn\'t phasing me but i really wanted to kick him out my living room. lol, thanks for the bad energy guy, i really needed this. ||2

What an incredible seven game series. I'm not gonna lie, I was bored after Game 2, but I'm so glad I came around. This entire season was fantastic. \n\nLeBron James, once again, silenced his critics with one of the best Finals performances of the past decade. |OKC Hornets|2
Lebron exposing his 2 boys to what the future expectations are lol||2
# What a great game! \n\nGolden State was doing their thing with the 3s yet Irving stepped in and kept them close. Lebron and Love of course did their thing too. In the final minutes, it's Irving with the breaker 3 after last 3 minutes tied at 89. When Golden State couldn't tie after some fierce Cleveland defense, the much desperate Cleveland could ***FINALLY*** rejoice! \n\nThis Game 7 was something fierce. ||2

is this the first time a team has as many losses in the regular season as the playoffs?|Cavaliers|2
In NBA it has to be. Max losses in playoffs is 12. Only 4 NBA teams have been 13 or less losses in reg season losses. 69 Lakers, 96 Bulls, 97 Bulls and this years Warriors. But 15-1 Vikings and 16-0 Pats did it in NFL off top my head. |Bulls|1
Now bring James to Orlando and see if he can win one here. ||2
Stop fycking it up with yo rookies|Hawks|2

Who is the real king of the north? Lebron James or Jon Snow?|Spurs|2
one if the best games i've ever watched. Lebron put everything into that game. 27/11/11 is amazing.\n\nAlthough I do wish lebron had a marquee 40 point elimination game that willed his team to victory, this is who lebron is and i dont know how anyone can expect otherwise. Great game, great series, and great fucking season as a whole for the NBA. Props to draymond, he played like he really wanted it today.|Rockets|2
The first and probably best game of NBA I will see.||2
What a series. Heartbreaking as a warriors fan but as a sports fan the overall storyline and quality of game 7 was insane. I just wish the warriors had managed to stay healthy. I feel like injuries made a huge difference in the series||2
To all those haters and doubters who were throwing shit at Lebron in the first 4 games of the series saying he chokes in big games, he can't win anymore without changing his playing style, etc, James just proved that he can win the title with his style of basketball and leadership.||2
> he can't win anymore without changing his playing style\n\nHow do people that say that as an insult think it's an insult. Being able to adapt and change based on whats going on is a sign of a good player.\n\nIf he didn't change his play style and adapt people would call him a one trick pony.|Cavaliers|1

Congrats Cleveland, finally...|Warriors|2
I might be speaking in the moment here, but I don't think I've liked LeBron this much since his rookie year. Now that he isn't the entire focus of all of ESPN's constant praise and criticism combined with the fact that he's shown so much more maturity, he seems more likeable. I hope ESPN doesn't ruin this next season, but I'm sure they will. For the time being, I'm happy to say I was a witness. |Grizzlies|2

the story has been so good that I don't feel like Lebron HAS to do any more to further his legacy. If he does more after this then obviously that's great but that's just gravy as far as I'm concerned|Raptors|5

As much as I wanted to to hate Lebron because of how much he has dominated the Bulls, this moment still have me goosebumps. I'm very lucky to witness lebrons careers and this series he has proved just how incredible of a talent he is. Congrats Cleveland. ||2
Thanks to David blatt||2
Hopefully the Lakers don't pick up Barnes now.|Lakers|2

I'm sad because I've become invested over the last 2 years with the Warriors and their visually appealing brand of basketball, but I'm happy for the Cavs because this win means so much more to Lebron and Cleveland. I'm happy that it wasn't a blowout. Even with Steph and Klay being cold, they were in it till the end. |Vancouver Grizzlies|2
It's the fucking Catalina wine mixer...||2
Yeah but can Lebron back my boat trailor into my garage when the wife's car is parked like shit?||2

How does Barbosa not play more? I'm not saying if he plays a lot more that its guaranteed that the Dubs win, but the guy can spark some offense. Give him a couple mins early in the 4th quarter to provide some energy and get the ball moving. The warriors played way too much iso ball late in the game.|Warriors|2
completely agree||1
Here\xe2\x80\x99s my technical analysis for Game 7:\n\nIn this game, the Cavaliers won because they attempted and scored twice as many free throws as the Warriors (+11 point, Cavs) did. Next, the Cavs and Warriors essentially had the same amount of FGs made and FG attempts, where free throws aren\xe2\x80\x99t counted. This means both had an equal opportunity to score, but the Cavs scored one more field goal than the Warriors (+13, Cavs). However, the Warriors made 9 more 3-pointers than the Cavs, which was the reason why they were winning earlier in the game (+4, Cavs, which is how much they won by). Lebron\xe2\x80\x99s ability to draw fouls on shots/layups (8 made/10 free throw attempts) pushed the Cavaliers over the Warriors in this game.\n\nHere\xe2\x80\x99s my opinion for the series:\n\nWarriors- If you watched their games during the regular season, the amount of passes per possession were much higher than what we saw in this Finals series. We saw flashes of it but not as often as the regular season. Cleveland played a very disciplined man-to-man defense, not allowing the Warriors to get easy passes. In addition, it came down to poor shot selection by the Splash Brothers. As a Warriors fan, it was hard watching the game.\n\nCavs- In addition to Lebron\xe2\x80\x99s transcendent performance, the unsung hero is Tristan Thompson. The ability to draw rebounding fouls in addition to creating multiple 2nd chance opportunities on offensive boards.\n\nBTW, I\xe2\x80\x99m the founder of a new sports app called Ms Clutch. We made Ms Clutch to make sports news accessible to everyone. We want to keep you updated and help you build sports knowledge over time. There's a lot going on in the world of sports.

Good stuff. We actually got the open looks, but there were a couple of key mistakes:\n\n1. Putting in Festus Ezeli in the 4th quarter was a disastorous 2 minutes that wrecked the game for us. First he bites on a Lebron fake and fouls him behind the 3 point line, cutting a 4 point lead to one. Then he loses Lebron and Lebron hits a 3. Cavs up 2. Game completely changed. Bad move by Kerr. \n\n2. Harrison Barnes had open looks but missed most of them and just didn't have a good series at all. \n\nWhere was Barbosa? Where was Speights? ||1
;D|Cavaliers|2
Why are these little kids on the fucking stage it's really pissing me off ||6
Aren't those LeBrons kids? Cause LeBron can do whatever the fuck he wants |Celtics|1

yeah i guess james scoring 41 on game 5 meant they performed the same way. my bad. \n\ni give the cavs credit for coming back from 1-3 but that game 5 was pivotal.|Bulls|0
Congratulations Cleveland! Totally deserved!|Suns|3
Congratulations Cleveland, you earned it. Happy for Lebron and the whole team|Warriors|4
LeBron had a great night.\n\nNot taking anything away from the win as it was deserved, but this Curry that played in the playoffs wasn't the same Curry that played during the regular season. Wasn't as fast, didn't shoot as much and wasn't as accurate. He went from Superman to another player. Looked lost and bored multiple times during the series. Was likely injured, but still.\n\nGreen's shenanigans may have thrown the series.||5
How the FUCK do you take a fall like that, in game 7, with 10 seconds to go, and make a FT to pretty much doom the team with the most regular season wins in NBA history *in their own stadium*?\n\nLeBron isn't human. No mere man could manage to make that.|Cavaliers Bandwagon|2

As a non American it is so disgusting to see the owner and his family front and center of this.\n\nGood for Cleveland the city and Lebron, feel happy for them.||4
Why?  They but huge amounts of emotional energy into this shit.  You don't won a franchise for the money. You do it because its an indelible piece of the community.\n\nAnd this is a community that really struggles.  These aren't rich assholes from silicon valley.  These are people in a very tough area that really needs something like this.\n\nTo be an owner in some cities is a tough road.  Yes, they are all rich but you are always second fiddle to some dick like Jerry Jones.  It's hard to put together a good coach, winning players and make it all work.  Really, really difficult. If you could buy a championship, most teams would.\n\nAnd when things go bad, you are blamed, hated, and despised.\n\nThey are the owners, let them have their 2 minutes.  The team will get theirs.  ||1

Good fucking game Cleveland. Your team played with all heart. Warriors had it, and yes, they choked. I said it so many times to my dad as we watched the final seconds: go for 2s, there is no room for error with a minute left. Warriors continued to do the opposite for like 3 straight possessions. I love you Curry, but next season, watch the fancy passes...\n\nCONGRATS CLEVELAND, YOUR FANS DESERVE IT.\n|Warriors|4

This will never be seen, but greatness thing that I have ever witnessed in my life. That was my first NBA game that I have ever watched. I am an avid NFL fan but I felt like I had to watch this one. Never once has any sport game given me so much excitement. My football team has been to the superbowl twice and I've never been so hyped up before. Greatest ending that I could've imagined.

I can't believe what I just witnessed! I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a team, but wanted Cleveland to win a championship, so was cheering for them. I hated lebron after the decision and in Miami, but respected him after going home. I can't believe he actually delivered a championship in 2 years!  Well deserved finals MVP!\n\nI felt bad for love though so was happy to see him have a good game 7 with all those rebounds. I hope they don't trade him this summer! ||3

As a Warriors fan, it sucks to watch us lose like this when we could have closed out earlier. But hats off to the Cleveland Cavaliers and kudos to lebron for carrying his team. Kyrie was special too. Happy for JR who was emotional about it. Green Thompson Curry Livingston and Barbosa showed fighting spirit. Also Verejao cannot basketball. He is 0-2 in finals.

Here's another thing I learned from these playoffs. Klay Thompson is better than curry.|Mavericks|3
This will probably get buried, but you know what made me happy about the Cav's win and the way Game 7 went down?  It FINALLY proved the fact that, when playing against the Warriors, if they just miss threes either on their own or through superior perimeter defending, and never heat up in the game, they have very little else to make up for it.\n\nThey Have a Deep bench, sure, they include hard fighting defenders, of course, they emphasize team play and ball movement to get guys wide open three looks, great.  But a three pointer is a risky shot no matter who it taking it.  That three-point shooting reliance that was such a major aspect of the Warriors style of play will be a fad, like disco, it will not become a main strategy of future coaches in the league.  In many ways it completely contradicts tried and true basketball fundamentals for one, and for another, it simply cannot be relied upon.\n\nYou can argue, but we just saw that in this game.  As a result, the Cavaliers are champions.  \n\n|Timberwolves|3

Cleveland gets a title. \n\nLebron gets one for the land. \n\nHits a free throw to seal the game injured. \n\nLebron 6 straight points off three attempts. \n\nKyrie three for the lead. \n\nBeats the best team of all time arguably. \n\nComes back from 3-1 first time ever done in finals. \n\nJesus Christ. As a Celtics fan I feel like crying as well seeing the emotions of those players and lue. \n\nThis is going down in history\n\n|Celtics|4
He finally delivered, nobody can say he owes anything to anybody anymore. And he did it by pouring his literal life force on the court. Nothing to hate here. Good on you, Bron. Probably the greatest finals performance ever.|Thunder|3
Greatest ever????||1
Don\'t break your ? button now. Really not the time to get into a "who\'s greater" debate right now. Just stressing how amazing he just was.|Thunder|1
Been saying it since the beginning of the season - the Warriors are a one trick pony and they'll be exposed in the playoffs. But the general public was so impressed by this team that was able to make threes drop like nothing in the highly competitive (/s) regular season. \n\nGive the elite teams a chance to break down GSW in a best of series and their weaknesses will show. Lo and behold they barely stumbled into the finals while the Cavs cruised their way in. I'm a Laker fan myself but I'm just glad that the better team won this one. LeBron really worked for this win and no-one deserves it more than him. would've been really bummed out if the Warriors actually won with their shallow game plan. Damn I'm salty GOCAVS |Lakers|3
Right there with you. I live in the bay and no one would hear it all season. They have no post season extra gear. ||2
Curry and Lebron will never be mentioned in same sentence again.||1
There's so much salt in this thread and none of it is from Warrior fans. Your fan base has acted with class this entire post season and although the ending wasn't what you wanted you should hold your heads high knowing that your team competed at an incredibly high level and did it with dignity.\n\n\n\nIts funny to see the LeBron haters scatter like cockroaches once the lights come on. Congrats to Cleveland, LBJ, Kyrie, JR, K-Love, Shump, and all of the Cavaliers fan all over the world. Way to go LeBron, you've always acted like a champion on and off the court and now in Cleveland...YOU ARE ONE.|Knicks|4

He ain't MJ|[PHI] Allen Iverson|2
You can obviously still debate it, but for one, LeBron is probably going to end up with much better all time stats than Jordan by the time he retires, and this finals man... MJ never won a finals by himself. I mean obviously Kyrie was key, but LeBron made this happen.|[SAS] Kawhi Leonard|1
Come on, Kyrie averaged 27 a game and outplayed the MVP on the other team. Pippen was never THAT good.|Heat|1
I don't know, I'm pretty sure Pippen was really good. Good series from Kyrie, he's probably a better scorer than Pippen already, but that's like, the weakest part of Pippen's game.||1
I agree with you on the stats but to say Lebron won by himself is just not true. Kyrie carried them for stretches. Lebron was the best player on the court but he did not do it by himself. Bottom line MJ would slaughter his own teammates if it meant a championship. Lebron does not have that in him. MJ is the greatest. |[PHI] Allen Iverson|2

If we didn't get such a damn good game I'd be mad.\n\nBut real talk here, if you're allowed to say that was a flagrant foul then I'm allowed to say Draymond Green's kick to Steven Adams balls was just purely an accident due to his 'weak core'.|[GSW] Andre Iguodala|0

This sub is dumb as fuck.\n\nA few days ago you were saying that the Kevin Love trade was a mistake and that a rookie player with no shooting skills would have been better for the team. A few days ago you were saying that Kyrie really is "a shooting guard in a point guard\'s body". A few days ago you were saying that Draymond Green got in LeBron\'s head. A few days ago you were saying that LeBron is not clutch. A few days ago you were saying that the Warriors were gonna win in 5. \n\nToday you get shut the fuck up by LeBron James dad-dicking you. You are so reactionary and petulent. \n\nYou live by chucking, you die by chucking.||2
Agreed. This sub is pretty fucking bad. There's a lot of young kids in here. Reddit demo is pretty young ||2
Is it unwritten law to boo the Commissioner no matter what the sport? I'm not an NBA fan (trying since the Hornets are back though) but to a casual observer, Adam Silver is a solid commissioner when compared to the rest, particularly Betteman and Goodell. The NBA I remember (pre New Orleans Pelicans) was rife with criminal miscreants and general thuggishness, and what I've seen and heard now is a vast improvement to the 90s and early 00s. ||2
Not really, the reason they were booing most likely stems from the way the NBA handled the suspension of Draymond Green. Had he not gotten suspended Adam Silver maybe wouldn't have gotten a warm reception but at least less boos then he got today. |Wizards|1
Pretty much since the "Malice at the Palace", the league has tried to clamp down on what you\'re talking about. It\'s just a matter of every team that gets punished for an infraction feeling persecuted. |Pistons|1
Never liked Lebron but got to give that man respect for dealing with the BS he deals with. Some players get passes while others don't. And he did something he set out to do. Win a chip for CLE. ||2

That was an incredible game to an intriguing (but not exactly a completely entertaining) series. While I had wanted the Warriors to win, I\'m am truly glad to see LeBron James finally win one for Cleveland. \n\nWhile I don\'t necessarily think that the Cavs "solved" Golden State, they played their asses off the past couple of games, and deserved the win. Sometimes their play wasn\'t pretty, and sometimes they relied too often on iso, but they made the important plays and pulled ahead of a historically-great Warriors squad. \n\nThere\'s a reason why the Golden State Warriors were one of my favorite teams to watch this season, and why the Cleveland Cavaliers are my favorite team to play as on NBA 2K. GSW\'s gameplan requires perfection from all of its players, and when things work out for them, then it\'s one of the most beautiful sights in all of sports. But if cracks start to show (which did the entire post-season), then a team like the Cavaliers - an imperfect but still absolutely incredible team - can take advantage. As for the Cavaliers, their passing isn\'t as gorgeous and their parts don\'t quite add up to a beautiful whole in the same way GSW does, but LeBron James is still the best basketball player in the world right now and he\'s backed up by great players who are fun as hell to watch (JR Smith, alongside Andre Iguodala, is one of my favorite players in the league today).\n\nBut all in all, this was just an incredible way for the series to end. An absolutely stellar game all the way through. I cannot wait for their third Final series next year.|[GSW] Andre Iguodala|2
This is going to sound totally dumb but I was partially pulling for the Cavs just to lessen the chances of violent riots in Cleveland during the GOP Convention there in a few months.  I didn't want those folks to have any extra reasons to be furious when that show rolls through.\n\nLebron may have just saved Cleveland from being burned to the ground by Trump vs. Anti-Trump protests.|Spurs|2

Cleveland is the unluckiest of cities.  No pro sports team in Cleveland has won a title in 52 years.  The city has had their hearts torn out so many times, in so many ways, including having their football team move away*, and then winning a championship the following year...      \n\nEven sports fans who despise Cleveland are throwing mad respect toward the city right now.  And every sports fan in Cleveland, even people who aren't regularly basketball fans, are giddy as fuck tonight.   It is seriously magical.\n       \n\n^(*and ultimately replaced by a very struggling expansion team of the same name.)||2
This is awesome!||1
Sort of.\n\nIt would be like if Leicester City clinched the championship in the last game of the season and did it against the defending champions and their best player had promised Leicester he'd get them a Championship a decade ago, and finally delivering in Extra time. \n\nMaybe, soccer analogies are hard|Grizzlies|2
Good analogy though!||2
They weren\'t the underdogs that Leicester were, but they are a rust belt blue collar city that has had horrible luck in every sport. Finally got a "Big 3" sport championship after a massive drought. They also made a comeback winning 3 straight elimination games against the team with the best regular season record in NBA history. |Thunder|2
Cleveland hasn\'t won a championship in 54 years.\n\nAnd I don\'t mean the Cavs. I mean any professional sports team in Cleveland.\n\nWatch the ESPN Documentary "Believeland"||3

Green had one hell of a game in a losing effort.  Still can't believe a Cleveland sports team won a title. What's next,  a black president of the us?  The sky is the limit now. |Pelicans|2
With this championship, Lebron James became no 3 top player of all time, after MJ and Magic, displacing Larry Bird who now is in 4th position.||2
He get's an asterix. A happy one. Winning a title for Cleveland is something special that needs to be noted on his record. He's done things Jordan hasn't. Jordan never dropped triple doubles like LeBron, never went to 4 straight finals, and never won a title for Cleveland. Cleveland. Where ever we put LeBron, he has transcended sports. He is bigger then and more than just an athlete now and forever. |Celtics|0
While I want to agree with you, what about kobe? While I do not like the guy, he has 5 championships.||1
5th position behind Larry Bird. It is not only how many rings you have.||1
Top 10 is very subjective of course and Kobe belongs among the all time greats, but I think most agree he doesn't belong in top 5. One of the best scorers of all time and insane competitor, but just look at the Finals he's played in. 2 out of 5 FMVPs and some argue Gasol should've won 2010. And he ~~doesn't~~ didn't (so weird to talk about Kobe in the past tense) make the team around him better in a way like Lebron or Magic does/did. \n\nedit: I think you get a better discussion about ranking Kobe in or out of the top 10. Personally, I'd go with MJ, Lebron, Kareem, Magic, Bird, Duncan, Russell, Wilt, Shaq (in no particular order). Now do you rank at least one of Olajuwon, Jerry West, Elgin Baylor or Oscar Robertson over Kobe? In my opinion yes. |[CLE] LeBron James|2
Welcome warriors fans to the season you never want to talk about again. We saved you a seat right next to 16-0 patriot fans.||2
You come at the King, you best not miss.||2
Kyrie was the MVP tho||1
Lol wut? \n  \nJames led the series in every major statistical category.  Kyrie was a huge part of the win, but LBJ is MVP.||2

I told everyone LeBron James is the greatest NBA player on the planet.Hometown champion got the ring. ||1
The run and gun D'Antoni style of basketball and the analytics do work. But that crap doesn't work in the playoffs when both teams see each other night after night and have a really good idea what you're gonna throw at em. That shit is better defended during the playoffs/finals because you've seen the same schemes during the regular season. So GS couldn't run their game which relies on getting up court and launching what used to be a high percentage shot beyond the arc. When GS is up by 10-12 points the Splash Bros. et al are relaxed and can heat check from 30 feet with no regrets. Tonight they fired a few hero shots under pressure and didn't hit jack. No reliable post-up back to the basket schemes (high percentage buckets) were an option tonight. No fast-break spot up 3s to get em going. Just way too much pressure for GS which led to them Playing a half court (non GS) style of play. Cleveland simply won the game by making GS play old school basketball and not allowing them to play the GS D'Antoni inspired run and gun style of playing. The @smashbros couldn't make their 30 foot high percentage game 7 hero buckets. When those shots drop there's no stopping them. The wide open 3s Green made were gimmes. But the @smashbros really needed to be part of the game if GS was gonna gain momentum. And for the rest of my tangent, ladies and gentlemen please allow me to remind you how a HS talent came into this league and made rookie of the year. During his 3rd season he took a team of professional nobodies to household name status just like Michael Jordan did. But it took Michael 7 years. The other not-so-well-known fact about Michael is that he did threaten to leave Chicago if Jerry Reinsdorf didn't go out and get him the help he needed to win a championship. Reinsdorf owned the Bulls and the White Sox. H couldn't care less if Michael brought a championship to Chicago because his seasons tickets and the seats were always sold out as long as everyone wanted to come see Michael. Dan Gilbert was no different. So LeBron made a very wise business decision. Look at em now. Hate em all you want. He's a winner.||2
LeBron's secret motivation - Sticking it to Miami.  On Mike and Mike just now. Wow. ||1
Apparently "someone" in Miami told him that going back to Cleveland was the biggest mistake of his life.\n\nThat "someone" had to be Pat Riley. The only other person who would talk to him like that is Dwyane Wade.||2
LEBRON JAMES IS THE FUCKING GREATEST PLAYER IN THE WORLD |[NJN] Vince Carter|2

What does that even mean?  Number 2 in what?  Tim Duncan has had a better career than Lebron and I do not think he is top 5.||-2

Seriously quit with the bandwagon shit. Your team has them everyone has them. It's actually good for teams. It drums up interest. You team didn't magically gains fuck ton of fans when Lebron came back? Your team averaged 20,000 people before he left and it was down to 17,000 after he left. But yes your team is 100% loyal and have no bandwagon fans. |Lakers|1
No.|[CLE] LeBron James|-2

Fuck. Yes. We witnessed some incredible basketball tonight.|Pistons|1
Lebron is the second best player ever. I'm sorry Kareem. Lebron is a perfect basketball player|Pistons|1
Easily second best. I'd still take peak LeBron over peak Jordan. I don't think he'll ever be able to match Jordan's record on paper, but he's every bit as good a player as Jordan. Plus he's more versatile and fun to play with.|Supersonics|2
I think Lebron is easily the player you'd want to be teammates with. He's probably top three teammate among all time greats. Not sure if I'd choose him over peak Jordan. I've never seen someone rise to the occasion like him but I'd have loved to see it|Pistons|1
Yeah, I suppose peak Jordan versus peak LeBron largely depends on who else is on the team. But it's cool that it's even close. LeBron didn't need to win tonight to prove this, but now even his haters will have to grudgingly accept it.|Supersonics|1
Agreed. It doesn't make his career but I think now it's impossible to bitch about him without sounding like you hate him|Pistons|2

Gotta love all the salty warriors fans downvoting everyone.|Spurs|1
To come back from 3-1 is something very special. \n\nGreat job, Cavs. ||1
LET'S TALK ABOUT HOW KYRIE WAS THE BEST PG IN THIS SERIES AND IT WASNT EVEN FUCKIN CLOSE.||1
I can't wait for this 30:30 and actually say I witness all of it. |Cavaliers|1

Lebron with the manly tears |Hornets|1
Two things were obvious in these finals: the Cavs were hungrier for this championship, and Curry lost his magical powers and now has to go on a quest to get them back.||1
I love LeBron James so fucking much |Cavaliers|1
I WAS HERE!|Heat|1
This has to be one of the best basketball stories. Lebron comes home to bring home a title, Cleveland wins championship for first time in 50 years, beat best regular season team of all time, comeback from down 3-1. Wow. History.||1
Gratz to the Cavs! CLE about to become overpopulated come February 2017.||1
Holy shit.  Curry 4th quarter meltdown, and Kyrie Fucking Irving.  Daymn.\n\n73-9 and out.  Wow.|Trail Blazers|1
This is incredible I'm so happy for Lebron and the city of Cleveland right now.|Heat|1
Does Lebron retire? |KnickerBockers|1
Well, the Steph curry phenomenon, when it was hot, was the most fun and crazy thing I've ever seen. It's over. What are the Warriors supposed to do, win 74 next year? ||1
Thugball > Basketball ||2
All Hail to the King|Lakers|1
Alright, I'm not pity cheering for Cleveland anymore. Fuck the cavs, go Hawks!|Hawks|1
Anderson Varej\xc3\xa3o just chilling with his ring ||1
Cleveland rocks! Cleveland rocks! Cleveland rocks!!!!!!|Raptors Bandwagon|1
I repped the Warriors bandwagon flair to its logical conclusion. Good game Lebron, Kyrie and the rest of the Cavs. You earned this. You were down 3-1 and fought back. The Warriors couldn\'t beat you and as much as I hate the circlejerks and countercirclejerks re: Lebron, there is no denying he\'s an all-time great. And now, back to your regularly scheduled Crying Jordan, Pippen shirt, and "LOL WARRIORS" memes.|Lakers|1
**FUCK BOSTON**|Lakers|1
WHERES THE HYPE VIDEO? WHERE IS THE HOIST VIDEO?!|Hornets|1
Golden state fans are now cavs fans so congrats yall!|Thunder|1

Lebron gave it all he had at the end. Hitting that free throw after that landing... We are all witness!\n\nCongrats Cleveland! I'm glad I was able to be a bandwagon for a while, great series!|Timberwolves|1
Just kill me now. \n|Warriors|1
IM SO HAPPY! OH MY GOD IM CRYING. I FUCKING LOVE LEBRON! CONGRATS CLEVELAND! |Raptors|1
Who would have thought that Bogut was so important?||1
If this isn't top of /r/all in another minute, I'll be disappointed.||1
As much as I am miffed at the league office getting away with meddling yet another finals series, I am more disappointed at GS.\n\nTerrible coaching and the top two best scorer not performing for the biggest game of their life, what a colossal fuck up.\n\nThey had a chance to overcome the league's script but they ultimately became just a joke.||1
EAT A DICK DONKEY LOOKIN ASS DRAYMOND||1
Kyrie is a killer man, so fucking amazing|Cavaliers|1
As a warrior fan, it is soul crashing that Curry wasn't even the 4th best player this series||1
This was amazing.\n\nFor the land!|Rockets|1
#WHY AM I CRYING?!|[CLE] Kevin Love|1
LOVE THE WARRIORS STILL. DOWNVOTES RAIN DOWN UPON ME. CAVS EARNED THE RING|Warriors|1
The Warriors really choked big time. Up 3-1 and then lose 3 in a row. GG Lebron and the Cavs|Lakers|1

What a fucking season. LeBron added to the legacy. Holy shit. I can't believe that Cleveland have their ring. Amazing.|Raptors|1
So many down votes man some angry warriors fans.  Don't worry up voting all. |Trail Blazers|1
Holy shit, what an amazing series by both teams. No horse in this race, but I was rooting so hard for LeBron and Cleveland to do it. Congrats!!!!||1
Two years ago I hated Lebron. Now I couldn't be happier to see him win. What a series.||1
LETS CROWD LEBRON CRYING AND HAVING A MOMENT! HOW MANY CAMERAS CAN WE FIT AROUND HIM?|Trail Blazers|1
I blame Harrison Barnes |Trail Blazers|1
LEBRON JAMES!||1
Warriors are the worst 73-9 team of all time||1
Goddammit Cleveland deserves this. Congrats Cavs.||1
The Warriors last real possession was awful. Thankfully, we won't have to hear the argument that they are the best team of all time anymore though.|Bulls|1
Mouth guard magic juice ran out.||1
What the fuck was steph doing with 20 seconds to go? Iggy was wide open on the wing|[DET] Ben Wallace|1
STEPH TOOK DUMB SHOTS AT THE END|[TOR] Andrea Bargnani|1
Shooting teams - 1\nBarkley - 1|Heat|1
would have been truly legendary if that dunk was the one that ended them, but i guess a free throw with an injured wrist is ok too :^))))||1
I'm sorry Doris hahaha. Like Kyrie apologizing to his teacher|NBA|1
Much deserved. Congratulations Cleveland! Legendary game. |[HOU] Yao Ming|1
gg||1
It just got really quiet around SF||1
Im so happy Richard Jefferson got a championship. He was always my favorite player on the Nets.||1
Fuck steph curry ||1
Curry still young and has helped the team get up to where they're at||1
Wow. LeBron James absolutely killed it this game.  Fucking triple double. Curry fucking choked.\n\nThe GSW lost as many games in the postseason as they did in the regular season, 9. I doubt that's ever been done before.||1
Irving what a player man. We are witnessing history boysss||1
Guys, I'm actually a closet anti-LeBron \n\nBut Im genuinely happy for him and the city|[LAL] Adam Morrison|1
Congrats Adam silver ||1
So many people are crying today. Tears of Joy and Tears of Sea Water.|Lakers|1
How can anyone not be happy for Cleveland right now?\n\nThey're finally, FINALLY a Championship city again. This means so much to them, to the team, to the city, to the fans. ||1
CONGRATS TO THE GOLDEN STATE WARRIORS FOR THE MOST WINS IN NBA HISTORY BY A RUNNER UP|Bulls|1
Beautiful. :)||1
Chokeland state|Bulls|1
S/O to Kerr for subbing in Ezeli with 5 mins left and costing us 5 points|Warriors|1
Steph curry is going to have nightmares all off-season. Guy choked so hard the last 5 minutes. GS made all the right plays on D and he played like dogshit.|[LAL] Kobe Bryant|1
All jokes aside not trying to troll. I hardly watch NBA and i'm pretty new to it.\n\nIs Curry even the best person on his team?||1
In the regular season curry was an absolute offensive machine, shattering records and having arguably the greatest offensive season in history. He got injured twice in the first round series and while shown flashes in the playoffs hasn't been the curry during the season.|[LAL] Kobe Bryant|1
Bruh greatest player in the universe, my shit talking didn't back fire thank god. ||1
CONGRATS TO THE BEST (REGULAR SEASON) TEAM EVER!!!!|Bulls|1
Wow, what a game. Honestly happy for Cleveland. Coming from another city that never wins, well done.|Timberwolves|1

Lebron with the huge block..\nKyrie with the 3..\nGAME OVER!!||1
That shot by Kyrie.....\n\nI'm seriously stunned right now. This is a historic upset|Heat Bandwagon|1
Sweet sweet warriors' tears ||1
Love had to go super saiyan to guard curry|[SAS] Kawhi Leonard|1
Man warriors are so disappointing. Sucks LeBron gets another ring, I was rooting for them warriors.||1
I've never seen a bigger choke in sports history ever. Steph Curry is to blame. Unanimous MVP of a 73-9 team and they lost when up 3-1|[SAC] Mike Bibby|1

STOP MUTING THE SOUND ABC|Lakers|1
Kinda glad the game went to the Cavs. Lots of bad plays coming from us, but either way, Cavs won it fair and sqaure; GG.|Warriors Bandwagon|1
The greatest of our generation.|Trail Blazers|1
This has got to be the most storybook finals ending ever, right? How could it not be? Defeating the record best team the NBA has ever seen to bring a championship to a city on a 50+ year drought? In Game 7? First ever to come back from 3-1 down in the Finals? Could not write something better.|Rockets|1
Doris is gonna be drinking champagne and shaking her ass at the pool later||1
wow||1
Doris is on something. Painkillers? ||1
CONGRATS CLEVELAND and the KING for a historic win!\n\n|Magic|1

Most monotone post-game interview ever.|Charlotte Hornets|1
What the hell happened to the Warriors?|Warriors|1
What if he retired |Cavaliers|1
I REFUSE TO BE QUIET ||1
As a Heat fan I have really mixed emotions about this. Sure LeBron left us, but he did leave us with 2 championships. I guess I'm happy for him anyways:)||1
Congrats Cavs. Good series. Well earned victory and Championship. ||1
With that last block by Lebron against Iguodala Space Jam 2 is confirmed.||1
Im a spurs fan but i still cried after lebron won |Warriors Bandwagon|1
52 years since Cleveland's last championship. What a wild series! Congratz Cavs.||1
That block from LBJ in transition at the end of the 4th. Play of the game imho||1
Can someone explain to me why Tyronn Lue is so emotional? Does he have the same connection to Cleveland that Lebron does?||1
LEBRON JAMES BEST PLAYER IN THE WORLD |Knicks|1
Holy shit - I hate the cavs but I got to love this team. So much heart and emotion. This team beat one of the best teams I've ever seen. Cleveland- Dan Gilbert is a jerk but I am happy for the land today. |Lakers|1
Taking my lumps. Cavs took it. Good series, what a season. Now I want to curl up and die.|Warriors|1

That was absolutely incredible. Lebron was chopping some onions here in my living room. What an incredible series. Kyrie, Love coming to play and grab boards, Lebron's block.

Exactly what I was thinking...|Lakers|1
Still not as good as Kobe or Jordan|Lakers|1
Jordan and LeBron belong in the discussion of the greatest players ever.     Kobe is not even the best Laker ever.||1
The day Lebron drops 81, has 5 rings or actually takes a game winning shot I'd believe you. \n\nLebron belongs in the discussion for the only player to get into elimination games and spend the whole game pulling up and passing to everyone else. |Lakers|1
Well no discussion is needed for player with the most missed shots in NBA history.    Kobe will own that record for all time because because nobody will be allowed to brick that many shots. \n\nKobe was a talented gunner nothing more.    He got carried by really great front courts.||1
Just like lebron bricks shots? Dude has no jumper what so ever and if he's not bodying people to get to the free throw line or dunking he's nothing more than another kevin love. \n\nLebron getting carried by great players like Kyrie|Lakers|1

LeBron is a monster. Bad shooting night, but his signature block was INSANE. I don't understand how anybody can hate on him. He's a beast.\n\nCurry should get some criticism. He didn't show up at all this series. Without Draymond they would've been blowed out.|NBA|1

I've bee waiting 10 years for this specifically.. its finally ours. YEARS of such heartbreak for this great city.. WE FINALLY DID IT!!|Cavaliers|1

Alright let's start that who is the greatest ever talk again. LEbron vs Jordan. Congrats to Cleveland !!!|NBA|1

Kevin Love with the D, been cooking with the sauce, Kevin with the D boy|Lakers|1
Curry decided he was going to take a 3 no matter what and everyone knew it. Even Kevin Love can shut a guy down if he knows he only needs to guard 6 feet of space. Bad decision, you can still go for a 2 point shot there.|[GSW] Andre Igoudala|1
Final "FADE THE FLAIR" of the season...|76ers|1
YEEEEEESSS GUN SHOTS RVERYWHERE IN THE LAND WE HYPE|[CLE] Kyrie Irving|1
Fuck you Kyrie and that last 3. |Warriors|1
CONGRATS TO THE CAVS. THE BIG 3 TURNED UP TONIGHT.\n\nLebron with his pretty silent triple double (compared to his 5th and 6th games).\n\nKyrie with his insane finishes and the CLUTCH 3.\n\nLove playing like vintage Love by grabbing 14 rebounds.\n\nTT played well. JR had his hot streak.\n\nAMAZINGLY CLOSE GAME 7.\n\nCAVS FINALLY WITH A CHAMPIONSHIP! ALSO, FIRST TEAM TO OVERCOME A 1-3 DEFICIT BABY!!\n\n*Props to Green though. I was fucking scared he would never miss a 3 after his first half. Still... Fuck Draymond Green!*||1
What a crazy game. |Suns|1
Kyrie was like. I gotcha you lebron.|Lakers|1
Best post game interview ever|Cavaliers Bandwagon|1
HOLY SHIT\n\n||1
Did anyone feel the earthquake like feeling that was the Golden State bandwagon from loosing an enormous amount of people.|Bulls|1
Couldn't be more fairy tale than this: go away from your first club, everybody slams you as a traitor, go to a rich club, get titles, come back, fail at first, then lead a team to a 4-3 win over one of the best teams in history while being 1-3 at one point and giving the city its first even championship. Pure poetry.||1
Breaking the Bulls' record does not come to fruition on the championship floor for the 73-9 Warriors.\n\nLebron comes back to his hometown and wins the first ever Cavalier championship in franchise history. \n\nThe Cavaliers become the first ever NBA team to come back from 3-1 down in the Finals. \n\nCongratulations to Cleveland!!! Quoting Lebron: 'THIS IS FOR YOU!!!' |Raptors|1
We're all Cleveland fans.|Hornets|1
From a Warriors fan, congrats Cleveland.|Warriors|1
LeBron officially overtakes Jim Brown as Ohio's King.|76ers|1

Sounds like Doris Burke is bout to start crying too|Hawks|1
Lebron is SKT1 ||1
LeBron leaves? Cleveland would've pitched together to kill him. Now that he's won a Championship for them, they'd sell Jesus down the river.\n\n\nDamn. Have to give it to LeBron. |Thunder|1
Salary cap is exploding.  No reason the Cavs can't keep major pieces together for many more years of winning the East.  And I bet LeBron really appreciates Kyrie Irving as a teammate now.||2
Festus switching onto Lebron gave up 6 points in the 4th to let the Cavs tie it at 89... He shouldn't have been in the game.|Kings|1

I want to hear about that secret motivation|Cavaliers|1
The band wagoners will live on.||1
On a side note, I wonder how people will rank Kerr's decision to put in a player that is obviously not ready, for the most important time of the biggest game of a season, up on the all time bad coaching move list.||1
Can't win every year. Congrats to LeBron, the city of Cleveland and the NBA who all got what they wanted (let me have a little salt).\n\nSee you next year.||1
My stupid ass brother turned off the internet with 1:27 in the 4th.|Bulls|1

Well time to get rid of my bandwagon flair|Lakers|1
I thought Game 7 in 2010 between Celtics-Lakers was the greatest game I've ever seen, then it was Game 7 in 2013 between the Spurs-Heat....\n\nbut I don't think ANYTHING will top this. LeBron, you finally did it man. Savor every moment.|Raptors|1

Congrats Cleveland! Well fucking played!||1
WOOOOOOOOO||1
I'm a Bulls fan and I would've preferred a win for GSW, still I'm fine with the Cavaliers. It's strange to see that 73 wins meant nothing at the end. I'm sad for Warriors fan that paid more than $50.000 to watch their team losing. Good game anyway, congratulations!||1
Second championship my dad has seen. What a father's day|Cavaliers|1
ayy lmao Warriors beating showtime Lakers and Bulls look much different. But really great on the Cavs they did everything to win this and I'm just so happy to not see greatness happen.||1

I've never seen anything like this||1
Fantastic game! Congrats to Cleveland, so glad you guys won it (as hard as that is to write for me). \n\nCurry was awful second half, just plain awful. In the 3rd, he had five possessions where he handled the ball and attempted to make the play. 4 turnovers and 1 made basket in transition. \n\nHow good was Love on that last sequence against Curry, he had a good game. \n\nWell played and what a great series  |Knicks|1
Congrats /u/NewRedditKid. I knew your Embiid love would eventually pay off.|76ers|1

The best NBA experience I've ever had, this was amazing. I hope people give LeBron and Kyrie for that matter the respect they deserve, no better way to shut up the critics.||1
Obligatory 'Fuck Draymond Green'. NBA finally suspended his ass too. Nice work LBJ|Thunder|1
Why? He congratulated LeBron and played a good Game 7. |Warriors|1
He got away with dirty shit all season. It pissed me off when the NBA turned away from it, and that helped them get to the finals. If it means anything, I'm an OKC fan.|Thunder|2
It's Laimbeer Syndrome. You're hate of Draymond is justified. |Warriors|1
My take on what Steve Kerr must have said to Harrison at halftime:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/90B5REGHc0w?t=34||1

Those Varejao minutes in the 3rd were just awful|Pelicans|1
Now i\'m waiting for "BREAKING NEWS: LeBron is moving back to Miami."||1
You'd only see that if he lost. Why would move right off a championship?||1
I'm kidding.||1
Big Game James has returned 25 years later for a triple double in a game 7|Clippers|1
This is the best ever|Raptors|1
I'm happy Cleveland won and that Draymond Green lost||1
The last 3 games have been a living nightmare|Warriors|1

Not even mad. Grew up in Miami and he gave us two titles, and although I live in SF now and wanted the dubs to repeat, that was legit an amazing game 7. Basically came down to one play and just shows how close these things can potentially be. Props to them, they earned their first title. |Warriors|1
Ugliest final 6 minutes of a finals I can remember. I thought it would come down to who got hot. Instead it came down to who could make 1 shot. |Heat|1
At the end of the day I still have mad respect for Golden State, especially Dray who gave his all. |Spurs|1
Could the Golden State Warriors beat the Chicago Bulls?  Nope.|Hawks|1
wow dude really original fucking comment and idea. keep comparing two different eras in sports|Raptors|0
U mad|Hawks|0
U generally stupid and not creative|Raptors|0
so does varajeo get a ring?|Lakers|1

LETS GOOOOO!!!|Mavericks|1
Never been happier for a player isn't on my team. LeBron has solidified his legacy as one of the greatest of all time. |Thunder|1

This result turned a shitty day into a good one, congrats to all the cavs fans. Long awaited and deserved.|Spurs|1
So he got one for The Land. Come on back now baby.|[MIA] Alonzo Mourning|1
Dustin Johnson wins a major and Lebron gets one for The Land. Today ways a good day.|Celtics|1

A masterpiece by Lebron ||1
Well Cleveland, I have seen the Cowboys, Stars, and Mavs win a title and you just sit back and let it sink in.  You enjoy this and then after a couple of days rewatch game 6 and 7 and enjoy it all.  |Mavericks|1
Dumping my flair... ha fuck this meme team||1
Woo Hoo! Happy to see Cleaveland finally get a ring :)|Mavericks|1
Kyrie is a fucking beast, that shot won me $100|Lakers|1

Congrats Cleveland and congrats LeBron!||1
We are all witnesses. |Timberwolves|1
SHOUT TO RICHARD JEFFERSON! IT'S BEEN A LONG JOURNEY BOY! :,)|New Jersey Nets|1
OK:\n\nYears have passed since the last game. Lebron is playing with the Monstars. Decides to leave - comes home - signs with the Toon Squad to liberate them from their nightmare. Lebron, Kyrie and Bugs save Earth from the Monstars.||1
73 wins means nothing without that ring.  http://i.imgur.com/rI1Hxgs.jpg |Lakers|1
The free throw after the hurt wrist had me biting my nails.||1
Congrats to LeBron and the Cavs.  Wanted and deserved it more than GS.|Bulls|1
Unbelievable. Really all there is to say. Unbelievable Golden State's magical season ended like this. Unbelievable how LeBron decided he wasn't going to lose again and poured his heart and soul out to win. Unbelievable that Cleveland finally has a championship for the first time in 52 years.|Heat|1
Now we wait for the Indians to win a World Series and the Browns to win a Super Bowl.||1
All this year. Rg3 back to rookie form^1 throws for 5k runs for 2k, Indians are undefeated from here on out. ||1

First team to ever come back from down 3-1 and winning the finals and it's against the team with the best regular season record in the history of the NBA.  \n\nEasiest championship for Cleveland since 1965.|Cavaliers|1
Kyrie Irving is absolutely COLD. And LeBron deserved it. All-time great performance and comeback. What an amazing finals. |Raptors|1
Great competitive game, players were clearly tired in the last minutes, which led to some ugly basketball. Anyways, tremendous series comeback by the Cavs, with big games from Lebron and also Irving. Very poor job by the Warriors, especially Curry, he was just awful. Congrats to Cavs fans.||1
He's a BAAAAAAAD MAN |Heat|1
Golden State needs a new zero soda in honor of the number of points they scored the final four minutes of this game.||1
I just want to see what MJ has to say about the Warriors going 73-9 now.|Celtics|1
Warriors should've stocked cavs jerseys for sale after this game, could have made a killing on sales when all these die hard cavs fans since '16 stick around to celebrate|Trail Blazers|1

I feel like the block on Iguodala was the exclamation point to his team and literally the entire fucking world that this was his and more importantly Cleveland's championship this time around, that here was no fucking way they were going to lose this.|Raptors|1

There were quite a few "Oh shit"  and "Damn" moments in this game that block was very much an emphatic daaaammmmn  moment. |Trail Blazers|1
Wanted GSW to win, but you've got to hand it to LeBron and Kyrie. What a performance. Well deserved.||1
Cant really nitpick since they won, but shump was in the game farrrr too long.|Hornets|1
An appropriate ending to a historic season on a lot of different fronts. From the Warriors historic streak and record, to Kobe's last season and 60-point last dance, to LeBron and the Cavs coming back from 3-1 against all odds... It's been fun, everybody. A lot of fun.|Lakers|1
Sorry but ezeli should not have been put back in the game in the 2nd half after that horrendous start||1
The NBA Finals DVD commercials for the cavs didn't go on for a few minutes bc they had to hurry and make it. |Spurs|1

Crazy ass season and man what a game 7. Looks like Warriors shirts should be arriving in Nigeria anytime this week. |Spurs|1

As somebody born in Cuyahoga Ohio I want to congratulate the city of Cleveland for a long-deserved victory . This is a big thing.||1
I was pulling for the Warriors but it was a joy watching Lebron, with a major assist from Kyrie and the others, play at a transcendent level to finally get Cleveland a ring. |Lakers|1
So, for someone unable to watch the game or the aftermath... has anyone heard a "told you so" from Charles Barkley yet? ||1
Pretty sure we need to make Rabsho a mod now|Celtics|1

They won oh my god I can't believe they won.||1
Wow. That's all I'm gonna say.|[BOS] Paul Pierce|1
Holy shit. Seeing LeBron break down like that was SO powerful. That's a man who has given his life to his craft, and it has paid off in a way that no one else can truly understand. What an amazing season.||1
Wow, such a feel good win. I'm a Kings fan, but knowing what this meant to Lebron and seeing his emotions after the win, is truly special. Absolutely well deserved. And at last, JR Smith is now an NBA champion|Kings|1
Wait\n\nWhy the hell am I crying?\n|Grizzlies|1
Man I feel for LeBron. Glad he won.|Rockets|1
2 of the most memorable moments. Kyrie's 3 and Bron's fucking  30,000 block...|76ers|1
Great game 7, matching intensity of normal college basketball games.  Imagine if they played half as hard as this all the time||1
So much post game swearing I could only hear half of LeBron's comments because they kept cutting out the audio. Hey you fucks, quit fucking swearing!||1
Does this mean Love gets to stay a Cav?|Knicks|1
Res-fucking-spect. Can't believe I disliked Bron ...Imma cry and repent.||1
As a team suffering a Championship drought, you deserve this. Congrats! (Now come to NY and help us win one)|Knicks|1

3 rings for LeBron and maybe counting... I think the Warriors are gonna to make a knee-jerk chase for Durant and he pulls a DeAndre and says "fuck you guys, I just wanted you to lose your bench chasing me"|Heat|1
The Warriors went 10-20 from three and then 5-21. Live by the 3, die by the 3.|Timberwolves|1
LeBron played amazingly, he deserved this win. Nice job||1
Why did draymond have to come out and congratulate Lebron and the Cavs? Gained a shit ton of respect for him, but as always #fuckdraymond?|Grizzlies|1
Congrats to the Cavs! What a series! You guys earned it. It was something else to be able to watch Lebron and Irving go to a whole other level. \n\nTo Steph Curry; \n\nSee how awesome it is to win a title in your home town?? \n\nSigned, \n   A Hornet's fan|Hornets|1
LOL at all the idiots who were like "ok yeah it\'s happened plenty of times before but totes this time for realsy it\'s over the series it over" when it was 2-0|Thunder|1
Not gonna lie I almost cried when I saw LeBron right after the final whistle |Lakers|1
Anyone have a replay of the last minute or so? |Warriors|1
I respect Draymond for going back out there to congratulate Lebron after everything between them.||1
Lebron is a father of 3, a 3 time champion, and a MAN!||1
What an emotion filled Game 7.||1
Warriors break record.  Record breaks Warriors.|Bulls|1

Wtf why they booing silver now after everything ???|Heat|1
Doris makes everything sound so depressing. Jesus. Where the fuck is Sager?|Knicks|1
Not an exaggeration to say that LeBron displayed more value to a championship team than any one player in history has.  Taking a 1-3 team to win 3 straight against the winningnest team in NBA history.||1
Game for the ages.|Heat|1
I didn't think I wanted to see LeBron win. I was wrong.|Bulls|1
Irving > Curry\n\nLeBron best player of this generation, he deserves every single meaning of MVP. \n\nFugg i'm so salty Warriors couldn't close this out but it's all their fault and it's them to blame. Clearly Cavs worked hard with films and practice whilst it looks like Warriors were chilling thinking it was over. So sad to see 73-9 go to waste. |Celtics|1
LeBron got under Curry's skin in the last 2 games.\n\nKyrie's 3 + LB's block on the glass, just awesome \n\nBoth teams can be proud of the ball they played. Fucking tight game.||1
Last year: Trophy Presentation in Cleveland.  \n\nTonight: Trophy Presentation in Oakland.|Mavericks|1
For all those who said Steph this Steph that Lebron James made him look like those bogus ass shoes||1
That was a game for the ages. I wish the rest of the series was played that well on both sides and was really hoping for OT in this one since they finally were, but I have to give it up to Lebron. He played his hardest (it was especially great seeing him get up and rush up court instead of staying to complain like we've seen so many times) and put up a truly special performance. The team that wanted it more won.|[NBA] Kobe Bryant|1
Incredible. Can't believe they won when they were down 3-1.|Timberwolves|1
All these fans at Oracle are gonna hop on the Cavs bandwagon now ||1
They booing, soo sad and petty||1

That was the most enjoyable game I have watched in some time.

Its not even about GSW losing, no one cares about that, Lebron just carried the whole city of Cleveland to a big fat W.|Celtics|1
I'm amazed by this NBA season. Such a historical season and series. The storyline is incredible. ||1
Best season ever, had a 3-1 lead in the finals, and STILL couldn't win.  Here's to 74 wins next season.||1

DAMMIT. Ugh.\n\nStill, congratulations to the city of Cleveland. You have your championship now! GG.\n\nI'm kind of hoping that this Finals run is Steph's 2011 moment and he (and the entire team) manages to learn from it.|Warriors|1
They booin the shit out of Silver lmao|Serbia|1
I hope that trophy reads "2016 NBA CHAMPIONS" in Comic Sans|[SAC] Oscar Robertson|1
Kevin Love should still get traded after that shit show.  |Jazz|1
Lebron with that dad dick doe|Bulls|1
That Lebron Finals MVP speech though. ||1
I JUST READ A FUCKING GOT SPOILER..... FUCK||1
welp I'm out |Warriors|1
Yeah rub that shit ibn commish||1
Gotta be awkward for Adam Silver right now|Pistons|1
I have nothing to say|Pistons|1
the last five minutes was so stressful, for the last four minutes both teams went scoreless so yo just sat there knowing whoever me the next bucket would win. When Irving hit that three i got so excited i jumped up and rolled my ankle, then proceeded to jump up again when the cars won and rolled my ankle again.||1
Your turn Browns...||1
Let's not be crazy now |Pacers|1
does anyone have video or gif of lebron hugging lue|Raptors|1
Wait.... does this mean we get TWO free tacos from Taco Bell?|Timberwolves|1
Asking the real question. |[CHI] Jimmy Butler|2
Stop booing Barnacle Boy he's gonna turn evil again!||1
My heart has never been pumping more than watching the last 6 mins of this game. I don't even watch much basketball, but that was amazing. ||1
WHO ELSE IS BUMPIN BONE THUGS\nMO MURDAAAAAA||1
Cleveland Sports is starting to become great from the Cavs to Stipe Miocic to Mike Mizanin. Great time to be from Cleveland.||1
Congrats to Cleveland but fuck you Gilbert|Lakers|1
I hope they meet again in Finals 2017|Vancouver Grizzlies|1
I'm still trying wrap my head around them coming back from being down 3 games to 1.  That blows my mind.||1

BOO UPON HIM!|Trail Blazers|1
It is almost fucking 5 am over here in Germany, but I don't regret it one bit that I watched this game. I am so happy for Cleveland and LeBron that they finally won a title.|Pacers|1
Dan Gilbert doesn't deserve shit|[LAL] D'Angelo Russell|1
What a series. Congrats, Cavs!|Bulls|1
So fun watching the Warriors choke, especially Curry. He played badly yet will avoid most criticism. \n\nWe said Cleveland would have won in 2015 if they were healthy and they proved it. \n\nAsterisk next to the Warriors boys!|[HOU] Hakeem Olajuwon|1
Who are those little brats? They don't deserve to be up there. ||1
They're kids of rich people. They can be anywhere they want to be.|Suns|1
Damn did silver have to shit on Cleveland before handing them the trophy? |Knicks|1
Silver looks like a vampire.|Raptors|1
Insane ||1
Anderson Varejao and Curry cost them the Chip, and I mean this game not the whole season, Varejao with bad hands and not going up strong, and Curry taking too many bad 3's, when they could of run a better play to get a easier shot or maybe get more open.|Spurs|1
CONGRATS CLEVELAND!!!!! The curse had to be broken in the hardest way possible huh? So happy for that city. Y'all deserve it and enjoy it. Party hard tonight!|New Jersey Nets|1
Anyone watching via DVR using Kodi?  Crapped out on me with 10.9 left.\n\nAside from that, what a game!!||1
Best game in the series |Raptors|1
Man, this speech by Silver is really rubbing the salt in for the home crowd. |Celtics|1

LETS GOOOOO. NOW WE CAN WATCH GAME OF THRONES|Bulls|1
Obviously there are a lot of factors at play, but I think the biggest difference maker in this game was that the Cavs refused to lose.\n\nOutstanding hustle, great win. ||1
My live dreams on!!!!!\n\nLebron goes home to do what he needed to do. (Win a chip) \n\nOpts out. \n\nSigns with the Knicks. \n\n\nThank you. ||1

YOU COME AT THE KING YOU BEST NOT MISS.||1
Lol is that James Posey?|NBA|1
I genuinely think this one was the biggest one for LeBron. He fucking did it|Bucks|1
It's a tearjerker for both sides. Obviously, Cleveland's drought has ended, and the Warriors blew a 3-1 lead and failed to meet the expectations of a team that broke the regular season record.||1
Lebron James, take that trophy!||1
So MVP is either Kyrie, LeBron, or Tristan Thomas |Knicks|1
"You just witnessed <PAUSE> ..." ||1
  Fuck Dan Gilbert||1
Draymond was something special tonight. Best player on the floor. |Lakers|1

Grats Cleveland fans. Streak is broken!|Vancouver Grizzlies|1
I take back everything bad I said about Love so far in the finals. He played great and was a key to Cleveland's victory. ||1
God I actually teared up. Lebron truely loves his city and reached his goal against all odds. Never thought I'd say that after losing to him so much. At LEAST #2 all time list.|Pacers|1
In my mind, after this series you can't put him any lower than #3 all-time.|Grizzlies|1

I have never loved a team as much as I've loved this one. Absolutely amazing. Lebron and Kyrie were absolutely insane.|Cavaliers|1
Why there isnt any confetti or some kind of celebration? It looks so dead and just underwhelming.....||1
Probably because it's in Oakland. If the Warriors had won, it would be different ||1
I know but why didnt the federation or whoever put up some atmosphere for the team regardless of who won?||1
Cause they are in Oakland||1
Why dont they do it like other sports where they play in neutral ground and give half the tickets for each team ?||1
Cause its a 7 game series, not a one off game. 4 were in Oakland 3 in Cleveland||1
I understand but being the decisive game wouldn't have make sense to do it like that? 3 home 3 away and the decisive one in neutral ground||1
Kyrie is the real MVP !! but they have to give it to Lebron |Knicks|1
LeBron is John Cena if wrestling were real (and also actually basketball)\n|[NYK] J.R. Smith|1

I actually cried. Couldn't have written a better ending for Lebron and his team. We all knew winning one with the Cavs was going to be huge for Lebron. But coming back from a 3-1 deficit to win one? And against a 73 win team? Amazing.|Pistons|1

Lol LeBron had to take the "hardest route" by going to literally any team he wants and gets to select the entire team and then having control over the coaching staff. He is a top 2 player all time and dominated this series, but I\'m not feeling sorry for you|Bucks|1

Not tbd best game of the season, or the best championship play offs, but it's really cool that LeBron fulfilled his promise. I can't wait for next season. To the golden state fans, you guys played so tough and with so much heart. Go Magic!||1
Curry MVP and the future.  Remember all the people that said that|76ers|1
Pretty anti-climactic trophy presentation (compared to what i'm used to seeing in soccer). ||1
That's just because the visiting team won. If the Warriors had won they'd go much crazier with the on-court celebration||1
Yeah for sure. Something to be said about soccer finals being held in neutral venues ||2
I was thinking that too, coming from a hockey fan||1
Yeah kinda awkward winning it away haha||1

what a game! what a way to win a title!||1
I guess you were wrong Stephen A Smith||1
DIdnt know GSW had turrible Cs in Varjao (2 consecutive ball fumbles) and Ezeli (the 3 pt foul on Lebron). Coach should have kept the lineup of Draymond, Klay, Iggy, Barnes, and Livingston. Curry was awful tonight||1
I'm home... Kappa|Cavaliers|1
Those hats are pretty ugly IMO||1
better than spurs. it was white|Spurs|1
I bet Klay feel like he jinxed himself wearing those back to back shoes in game 5. ||1

I will never speak ill of the Eastern conference again||1
If there\'s one positive take away from this, it\'s that we will no longer be smacked over the head with how much "Cleveland deserves one, man".  So that\'s nice.|Raptors|1
Serious question, what do they do with the Warriors champ shirts and hats? Lol|Raptors|1
Mostly give them away to the homeless actually. ||1
Send them to impoverished countries|Supersonics|1
There aren't that many of them, since they didn't mass produce them. So they probably get donated.|Cavaliers|1
Shipped to Africa where lots of kids will think they won the title again in 2016.|Lakers|1
Most likely will be donated|Pistons|1
They send them to third world countries.|Knicks|1
Haiti.  Seriously. I was there on a trip and a bunch of kids had on the losers shirts from super bowls, etc.||1
African kids gonna think Lebron didn't win one for the land.  ||1
Bucks fan, but so happy for lebron (and the cavs)...  epic series. Hopefully the bucks can be there...at some point|Bucks|1
Woulda, Coulda, Shoulda. We can second guess the coaching and the shot selection in the end but that won't change that we loss. It was a hell of a season and I'll be right back watching next year. \n\nWarriors set allot of records this year and this loss, though a huge one, doesn't change that. We have a team that will be right back to the finals. \n\nWe can complain about so much but hats off to Cleveland, no second guessing they needed it. I guess you guys can forgive him for winning a couple ships for another team now but that still means he's won more for another city... Yes that's a back handed comment. I'm allowd to be a little salty. Fuck you Cleveland ;)||1
Does Lebron's career have to be over before he can get a 30 by 30?|Celtics|1
Curry was disappointing to Currys standards he set. Still love him though||1
How they gonna leave Bill Russell hanging like that?|Hawks|1
Now what are the chances the lakers can land lebron after this? That was the whole reason I was rooting for GS. Sad life.|Lakers|1
What a game! Congratulations to both teams, fought well and hard!|Raptors|1
Man, imagine all the shit that Lebron would receive if he pulls a game like Curry pulled today.|Suns|1

The thing that people don\'t seem to realize is the Cavs are huge on analytics.  It wouldn\'t surprise me if their incredible defense to end this series reflected this.\n\nhttp://www.cleveland.com/cavs/index.ssf/2016/02/lebron_james_doesnt_worship_at.html\n\n> "I do not" use analytics, James said during All-Star weekend in Toronto. "I do during the playoffs. Not during the regular season."\n\nThis is probably a reason why playoff Cleveland is a whole different beast than regular season Cleveland is as far as defense goes.\n\n> The Cavs actually have one of the most comprehensive analytics operations in the NBA ..\n\n> The Cavs use analytics to drive so many decisions, from the players they sign, to the lineups they place on the floor, to the game plans they build for opponents.||1
thank you for posting the stats, is there any source for future reference from which I can get live stats?||1

Congrats Cavs!  NBA made this a one game series and your superstars stepped up and outplayed the Splash Bros.  Dubs chocked the last 2 minutes and now the City of Cleveland can finally u[pdate this great music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZzgAjjuqZM) in celebration.  Fuck Dory!  You don't want to come to Cleveland?  They be NBA Champs now! |Nets|1
Warriors didnt score for the last 4:39. Even more than 2 mins.|Thunder|1
shit it's even worse than I thought.  |Nets|1
Chicago is the real winner.|Bucks|1
Wtf? Where can I watch the postgame? Local news randomly came on...|Knicks|1
ESPN2?|Rockets|1
ESPN now, and it's on nba.com as well!|Knicks|1
god is real.|Timberwolves|1
what a fucking game, holy shit||1
sup yall||1
I'm so fucking happy for LeBron. He is the greatest of all time in my eyes.|Celtics|1
Even as a Memphis fan/neutral, I have to say I wouldn't mind seeing these two teams go at it in the finals again extra year.  Now that it's 1 title each, it kind of feels like we need another one to settle the tie.\n\nPlus it's guaranteed to be another fantastic series.|Grizzlies|1
I wish this was the Browns, I have so much more sorrow for them.|[MIA] Dwyane Wade|1
Lebron is the first player since 1974 to win 2 Game 7's in the NBA Finals and his 2-0 records obviously tops, so he has that clutch.|Rockets|1
Draymond Green needs to really evaluate his life and the dumb fuck decisions he makes.|Heat|1
Let the roast of curry, barnes, klay, and the warriors begin.|Celtics|1
I'm so absolutely speechless. I've endured more than half my life loving the cavs. |[CLE] Kyrie Irving|1
Draymond at his most likable. ||1
shout outs OKC for wearing these gsw dudes down |[LAL] Kareem Abdul-Jabbar|1
and for showing the blueprint to disrupt curry's flow!||2

IT WAS 3-1||1
Any #HotTake from Ayesha this game?|Pelicans|1
"Well at least we\'re rich" |Spurs|1
*Harrison Barnes, Steph Curry, Festus Ezeli and Klay Thompson rip off their jerseys to reveal Cleveland jerseys*|Raptors|1
Could I get a max contract in the NBA? My reasoning is that I wasn't a net negative for the Warriors in the finals.|Pistons|1
Oh man best game ever. We know who the real MVP is.  |Cavaliers|1
OF all the games, this one is the one I felt the Cavs really won.  Game 3 was a product of being allowed to be waaaaay more physical than they should've been, game 5 was a Draymond thing...  They really earned this one, and while I was probably 65/35 in favor of the Dubs, if the Cavs had to win it I'm glad they did it on this performance.|[DET] Chauncey Billups|1
LeBron is like "Whose ya daddy"|Bulls|1
I guess you could say the 96 Bulls are better than the 16 Warriors now.  |Supersonics|1
I seriously hope I get to feel what Cav fans are feeling with my chargers one day. |Lakers|1
I feel like the Chargers are always a good team on paper and then half their players die by week 8.|Grizzlies|2
That 2006 to like 2009 team was amazing, too bad New England was out there going 16-0 and taking most of the attention away from how stacked those chargers were |Thunder|1
Yeah anything involving strength and conditioning for us is bad.|Lakers|1
Your face when Shump and Smith get rings before Carsmello. ||1
At least we got Porzingod, right? Right?|Knicks|1
Hey, there's talk we are going to bring in Derrick Rose. Depending on when his knees break, that's good for about 20 games of basketball early or late in the season before we miss the playoffs.||1
This SportsCenter postgame is awful with SAS |Wizards|1
Who is the guy on the left just looking around like, "We just gonna let him keep talking?"||1
Holy shit this is crazy. |Heat|1
Lou out coached Kerr in this game and the whole series. |Supersonics|1
Hi dad.||1
Lebron's wrist died for this||1
So is varejao celebrating with the cavs now?|[LAL] Kobe Bryant|1
Not after all that flopping\n\nI wouldn't make eye contact with him|Heat|2
Don't know what to type|Cavaliers|1
I need a hug.. In tears! This means so much to me |[CLE] LeBron James|1
Let the memes begin||1
LeBron revived his chasedown block|Wizards|1
LeBron James is mentoring Ben Simmons.  \n\nhttp://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/id/16321522/ben-simmons-all-tools-says-mentor-lebron-james\n\nHopefully Simmons can develop LeBron's power drives to the basket at the NBA level, because if so, we'll see this terrorizing the league for the next **15 years**.||1
I HAVE NEVER BEEN THIS HAPPY IN MY ENTIRE LIFE ||1
Damn, congrats to Cleveland. Did not think this would happen.||1
What a statement from Cavaliers\n\nwhat a performance throughout |Lakers|1
Kerr bombed on purpose because he didn't want the Bulls to be overshadowed by GSW. Or something.|Bucks|1
Incredible that the Warriors lost 9 games all season and went on to lose 9 games in the playoffs|Timberwolves|1
Man what a game. Also, shout out to Steve Kerr - mad respect for your post-game presser.|Cavaliers|1
I am so happy.  Never thought I'd live to see this day.|Cavaliers|1
The Cavs must be the most CLUTCH team this season||1
Why people are using Crying Jordan meme is beyond me... he's gotta be the happiest man on the planet right now since 95 Bulls are still the best... should be using crying Blatt meme, a man who got fired for a 30-11 record only to watch his replacement go 27-14, coach his all star game, and win a championship|Knicks|1
FUCK YOU REDDIT ADD MY COMMENT\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n||1
Do I get a trophy next to my flair?|Bucks|1
Any chance Durant chooses Cleveland? |Timberwolves|1
I'm a die hard Celtics fan and I absolutely hated LeBron . \nThere were too many battles , too many games 7 , too many wars with him for me to enjoy him so when the Heat lost to the Mavs and Spurs I was so happy lol \nBut after Paul , Kev and Ray left I learned to appreciate him and I fell in love with his greatness , the pressure he had to deliver since being 15 is unbelievable , but the talent ,the athleticism , the IQ  ,LeBron was always so good .\nI'm really happy for him if he didn't win one for CLE people would always hold that against him and a great player like him doesn't deserve that . \nCongrats Cavs fans yall deserve it !   ||1
ANYTHING IS POSSIIIIBBBBLLLLLEEE!!!! |Raptors|1
[YEEEAH](http://i.imgur.com/ehkNFt9.jpg)|Clippers|1
Shit, I could be mad that LeBron destroyed my team for years but this is the greatest story ever. He's finally brought a ring to Cleveland. Such a fucking legend.|[WAS] John Wall|1
man LeBron is such a crybaby /s|Cavaliers|1
it'll be pretty amazing if next years finals ends up being a rematch of this years.||1
it'll be pretty amazing if next years finals ends up being a rematch of this years.||1
Now what?|Mavericks|1
to think that if curry and thompson didnt shit the bed we'd have won handily. but no excuses, we lost|Warriors|1
I'm okay with going down with Curry/Thompsom shooting, but starting Ezeli in 2nd half and then in the 4th quarter evaporated our leads. I also think Barnes just wasn't good enough.|Warriors|1
nobody but draymond was good enough. this was game 7 of the nba fucking finals, being "good enough" doesnt cut it|Warriors|1
as a bandwagonner i am upset the team didnt win.\n\nbut congrats to the cavs lebron played amazing, and kyrie was super clutch.\n\nsee y'all next year hopefully|Warriors Bandwagon|1
YEET|Mavericks|1
This and  game of thrones made for an excellent night||1
So is Varejao going to cash in on that ring?||1

LETS GOOO |Cavaliers|1
As a Bulls fan I haven't been the biggest Lebron fan.  This series I was rooting for Lebron to win. Not for himself but for the city of Cleveland. The city of Cleveland deserves this. \n\nRespect for Curry and Draymond for congratulating the Cavs on winning.||1
DAGGER PUNCH, game 7 next year, book it|Pacers|1
This is gonna get buried but will David Blatt get a ring? I mean he was their coach for like half the season. |76ers|1
That is like asking if you ex wife gets half of your money after you divorce her and win a shit ton of money in Vegas. |Thunder|2
Shit I know. Its like thanks but this kinda awkward. I mean sure Ill take it. |76ers|1
K love with that clutch defense against Curry there at the end. |Rockets|1

Came down to the last 3 minutes. It was anyone's game. Good defense on both sides, but Cleveland made the shots when it counted. Congrats to the Cavs, well deserved.|Warriors|1
Lebron took over the series and brought the championship to Cleveland. What a fucking beast!!!|Kings|1
How long were the Cavs held scoreless there to end the game? ||1
10.6 seconds?||1
Nah, I mean total. It was at least 2 minutes I know. Forget the last GS point. ||1
If you mean Warriors, their last point was 4:39||1
We did it. We actually did it. I can't even take it all in right now....|Cavaliers|1
the reporters trynna get an injury excuse sooo bad aha, he's healthy just didn't perform||1
I love basketball.\n\nCongrats to the Cavs and all their fans!  |Thunder|1
Congrats Cavs and MVP Lebron\nEspecial mention to Kyrie and Green||1
Lol magics tweet. Lebron is top5!! \n\n\nNo shit. ||1
bron making sure to come out in that nike shirt. the under armour hate is real.|[HOU] Moochie Norris|1
That was phenomenal. Congrats to the Cavs and Cleveland. \n\nBig performances from all three of Cleveland studs. GOAT series from Bron. Kyrie looked like regular season Steph, and some great defense by Love on Steph (and a game high +19). That was the GOAT block by LeBron too. I screamed.\n\nTwo years in a row that Kerr got outcoached. Steph really needs to improve his decision making. His talent level lets him get away with a lot of things but he is definitely not J Kidd/Nash between the ears.||1
Probably a fine time to visit [Cleveland](http://i.imgur.com/XYOL8XY.jpg)||1
Respect for Lebron as much as I dislike him.\n\n\nUndeniable history has been made.||1

The Cleveland Cavaliers show that with heart, perseverance, and three #1 picks overall, you can win a championship.\n\nBut in all honesty, I'm really happy for him and Cleveland. Being the anointed one before you even stepped onto the court, then following through, is the hardest challenge of all.|Supersonics|1
It's wild seeing give an actual answer instead of the memorized cliche answers. |[CLE] Kyrie Irving|1

Lebron talking like me when I am drunk. It all makes sense in your head but it does not make sense at all. |Thunder|1
Check out Kevin Love's +/-...\n\nJust sayin', he played tough as nails!||1
They won't be serving chicken curry at the ESPN campus tomorrow||1
Very true for today. "If we played them 10 times they might win 9. But not this game. Not tonight... Tonight WE are the greatest team in the world." \n- Miracle \n\nCongratulations Cavs. Congratulations Cleveland. Congratulations Lebron.\xef\xbb\xbf|Knicks|1
History man, History has been made. Wow. So many reasons|Raptors|1
Cavs won for first time. \n\nFirst Cleveland win in like 50 years. \n\nFirst time a team has come back from being down 3-1 in the play offs\n\nGolden state has the best record in a season any team ever has.\n\nFirst time a team lost the same number of games in regular season as playoffs(GS).|Cavaliers|1
From the Warriors setting a regular season win record, Kobe Bryant going on his farewell tour, the raptors fighting for the north, Adams taking nut shots for the Thunder, Curry being clutch in the WCF, to Lebron fulfilling his destiny, it's been a pleasure watching the NBA with you fam. Congrat to the Cavs on breaking their curse. See you all next season. |Supersonics|1
NOW THE WARRIORS KNOW HOW I FEEL!|Thunder|1
Can I get a Lebron James copypasta of the 'Love Sosa' intro?|Spurs|1
HE'S A FATHER OF FOUR......... LIGHTEN UP||1
I said it on Thursday:\n\n2016 Cavaliers = 2004 Red Sox. \n\n|Magic|1
I was standing close to the TV during the block and fell to the floor when it happened.  So unbelievable.|NBA|1
I can't contain my emotions|Cavaliers|1
What a season guys. Kobe's retirement run climaxing in a 60 point performance. Warriors win 73 and Curry is the unanimous MVP. Cavs going down 3-1 in the Finals but Lebron (and Kyrie) going absolute beast mode and forcing a HISTORIC GAME 7 where King James brings a title to the land.|Timberwolves|1
BEST END!\nLegend season.|Cavaliers|1
What's the name of the 30 for 30 gonna be? ||1

The best season ever...that never was ||1

Happy for LeBron, Happy for Cleveland.||1
ALL HAIL THE KING IN THE NORTH||1
closely looking at the series as a whole, it's interesting to note that in all four of the GSW losses they inexplicably disappear offensively for a random qr. \n\nIn their first loss only scored 16 in the 1st qr\n\nIn their second loss only scored 13 in the 4th qr\n\nn their third loss only scored 11 in the 1st qr &\n\nIn their final loss they only scored 13 in the 4th qr \n\nI don't truly understand what happened here, but their offense almost vanishing every other qr fcked them over\n|Raptors|1
Charles Barkley is gonna be all over this. A jump shooting team will never ~~win~~ defend a title. |[CLE] LeBron James|1
I see a pattern,  1, 4, 1, 4.\n\nGSW to start the next season on 2 wins 8 losses. |Thunder|1
Fuck Im hyped. Where do people even buy merch? Quick before  I sobeer up and realize that I should not spend money.|Cavaliers|1
Just hit up nba shop online fam there's loads of championship gear|[CLE] LeBron James|2

JR Smith's post game interview made me cry! |Timberwolves|1
Can anyone pull up the stats? That's got to be the longest period of time without either team scoring in a finals game (3:32)||1
Cavs saved Kevin Durant!! We killed the Lil B curse!|Cavaliers|1
Man, to come back from 3-1 to beat OKC, you'd think Golden State could figure out how to make the Cav's lay down for 1 more game out of 3.||1
Lebron ain't on OKC||0
He didn't play them either, crazy how that works out.||1
If you can, pull a scanner for the city. So much happening there so interesting and funny to listen to! ||1
What scanners? I'm listening to a cleveland police scanner and just heard shots fired, car on fire, and someone getting hit by a car|Rockets|1
Sounds like the same one. It was a cop who got hit by a car! He called ems for himself and is getting his legged check out||1
Damn, poor guy. He sounds alright though|Rockets|1
Yea I think he's good. People jumping on cars now! Omg||1
I mean, I am doing my best to actively show outrage, but I can't.\n\nI just feel resigned for some reason.|[GSW] Draymond Green|1
I don\'t know what happened to Curry, Thompson and Iguodala; they just lost their performance. Last year they were great.\n\nBut congrats for the Cavs for making an impressive effort to get their first championship with "the king".||1
Curry was pretty pedestrian last year too. Not one vote for finals\nMvp||1
Steve Kerr should get some questions about putting Ezeli back in in the 4th. Dubs ended up +18! When they went small, yet put Ezeli in during crunch which ended up with him fouling Lebron on a 3 and then giving up a 3 to bron. Right during GS last push that could've given them the separation needed to win.|[LAL] Kobe Bryant|1
Both Shaq and LeBron forced the other team to play even terrible centers for long stretches of the game.\n\nAnd if Ezeli leaves, I'm not sure how Golden State is going to get someone much better.||1
The real shitty thing about the Warriors losing, i bet Kerr rests everybody for the playoffs next year, Pop style. |Mavericks|1
So many story lines to this game and series.  Incredible.|Clippers|1
Hey Heat fans I thought Lebron needed Reilly...|Bulls|1
MAMBA MENTALITY|[HOU] Moochie Norris|1
I enjoyed every second of this game. One for the history books the better team won that 3 by Irving and block by James sealed the deal ||1

Congrats Cleveland. All hail the king.||1
Hail to the King baby |Rockets|1
Absolute gold. Instant classic. ||1
Barnes probably earned whatever contract he will get this offseason. That was quite a disaster for him.|Heat|1
He would have made more money faking being injured|[PHI] Allen Iverson|1
The guy can't even defend. If he won't be paid, he'll be traded for someone or something. Hell, I'll even try to get that Wolves pick and join the fun by sending him to the Bulls, Wolves get Butler, Warriors getting that pick + fillers.|Heat|1
The crazy thing is he will get paid. Not sure if he gets the max now but he will get close to it. The NBA throws aways stupid amounts of money. |[PHI] Allen Iverson|1
If he's gonna get paid, I'd prefer him paid outside of the Warriors. I'll send him somewhere to get something better. I ain't paying something soon I'll regret.|Heat|2
He will have to take a discount to stay in the bay.|[PHI] Allen Iverson|1
He better be taking one. He's too big of a trade chip not to use.|Heat|2
Regular season win record holding teams in all 4 major sports have now failed to win the championship that year. Warriors now join '95-96 Red Wings, 2001 Mariners and the 2007 Patriots ^:'(|Celtics|1
Congrats, well deserved |Warriors|1
damnnn the gold is flowing today. \n\nGG cavs!|Rockets|1
We all got trophy flair.\n\nI don't know how to handle this moment.|Cavaliers|1
I'm happy for the city of Cleveland ||1
Okay, world can end now. \n\nCleveland won a fucking Championship. WOO!|Cavaliers|1
What happens to Cleveland now? Does Love still get traded?|Clippers|1
Trade Love and Frye, Get a better bench, get a better SG and PF that can play with Lebron. Iman has to go.|Heat|0
Love for Wiggins|NBA|1
K Love shouldn't get traded imo he was great all playoffs just doesn't match up well against one team in the league. I think they need to trade Shump tho|NBA|2
Well JR is getting a big raise. LeBron getting a new max, obviously. We'd still probably listen to offers on Love but I don't see him being shopped. I don't know if we're going to go back to figuring out how to use Mozgov because we really didn't this season, or we'd try to move him.|Cavaliers|3
anybody have that video of lebron they just showed on espn? |Suns|1
Obviously this is a ridiculous longshot, but does anyone know the name of the song that was played heading into a commercial break fairly early in the game that had the lyrics "yoooOoooOU! yoooOOuuuu!" (lol)? It was catchy as fuck and I didn\'t hear any other lyrics to be able to search.|Bucks|1
i believe it was This is what you came for by Calvin Harris||1
You glorious bastard, thank you!|Bucks|1
And thus one of the most 'historic' seasons in my NBA memory comes to a close. Exhilarating up to the very end. Was rooting hard for GSW to seal the deal but in the end Lebron and Kyrie got the better of them. Props to Cavs on their well deserved championship. NBA..where amazing happens. \n\nNow if the lakers could stop sucking...|Lakers|1
This is like when Leo won an Oscar.|[CLE] Shaquille O'Neal|1
Y'all should go see Chris Brown's last few instagram videos of him watching the game. Dude is Kyrie's best friend, and its fucking hilarious. |Raptors|1
Its totally going to be a Cavs/Warriors repeat next year. My god this rivalry is going nowhere. Take it in everyone, this is incredible.|Cavaliers|1
Not sure about that. I believe going forward they'll look more like the team we saw this post season instead of the team that went 73-9. Obviously a lot depends on what happens in free agency but if KD goes back to OKC I would have them as the favorites out of the west |NBA|3
Some dude will go to Spurs for cheap again as well. They will never go away...|Grizzlies|2
Shhhhh shhhhh let us fly under the radar ;)|[SAS] Tim Duncan|0
Possible, but not definite. They are both favorites, but there's always other teams waiting in the wings. Specifically OKC. Because as bad as Barnes and Ezeli were in this series, they were huge in making up that bench that allowed GSW's starters to stay rested, and with Iggy and Bogut getting older and coming off of injuries, their vaunted depth might be significantly depleted |[CLE] Zydrunas Ilgauskas|4

Nba finals series player rankings \n\nLebron>>>>>Kyrie>>>>>klay>steph?>draymond>Tristan Thompson> iggy>Klove\n\nMan it's weird thinking steph may have been the 4th best player this series. Maybe 3rd||1
Draymond moved ahead of Steph in this series with 2 huge games. Steph had a false 38 mostly puffed up with free throws.|Heat|3
Anyone remember what the betting odds were before this series started? \n\nAnd because MJ comparisons are inevitable...bonus points to anyone who can find the lowest odds from his 6 NBA championships. ||1
Dubs were 2 to 1 favorites, or close to it||1
I bet the cavs to win the title at +400....this was in game 5 of ECF....nice little $500 win for me||2
Wow. I can only imagine the fans who burned LeBron jerseys when he left Cleveland to the heat feel like now.\nCongrats to the king.||1
i wanted too, but my dad saved it. i eventually calmed down and became a less reactionary fan and wore it out to the watch party last night |Cavaliers|1
No intentional fouling by either team to force a poor free throw shooter to shoot free throws.  Still not sure why this is such a big deal for a rules change.||1
Tristan was draining them anyway. Would Kerr have the balls to put LeBron on the line knowing he's shooting in the 60s?|Heat|2
Golden state @ Cleveland 5pm on Christmas confirmed. I'm thinking the first game of next season will be OKC @ Cleveland. |Bullets|1

The real winner tonight is Varejao. He still gets a fucking ring||1
Is this really true?  If so that is bullshit|Spurs|1
Varejao played for the Cavaliers this year and went to the warriors after. They don't have to give him a ring but I think it usually happens||1
I don't really follow the NBA but this is incredible. Hats off to the Cavs||1

I\'d love to see a sub that asks cleveland how the phone call went to tell their boss they were sick the next day. Every business owner knows why they won\'t be in. They can\'t do anything about how many "sick" people are in cleveland today. ||1
I work in downtown Cleveland.  I parked about 6 short blocks away from my job, because our private parking lot was still chained off from the night before and the attendant had\'t arrived to work yet. \n\nOn my walk in, I passed several bleary eyed party people trudging back to their cars that were parked in the same lot I parked in.  \n\nOne girl, her hair slightly mussed, wearing a Cavs jersey, was walking slowly carrying a few pillows with her boyfriend in tow.  He was carrying an air mattress, deflated in the carrying bag (I recognized it because I have the same one).  A few paces behind him strode his friend, wearing sunglasses, looking at the ground and carrying blankets.  \n\nI crossed the street heading to my job and passing by the main party street where all the bars are and  deftly dodged all the crushed beer cans but accidentally stepped on the broken neck of a glass beer bottle crushing it underfoot. Confetti and cigarette butts litter the streets.  I\'ve never seen so many cigarette butts before.  It\'s like a cigarette ouroboros in the sidewalk cracks. The dumpsters in the alleys behind the bars are overstuffed with garbage bags, still leaking beer cans/bottles.  There is a small corner that is created on the side of a building where the exit of a parking garage is sticking out.  In the corner there is still a 6-can-beer-pyramid stack still standing.  In the corner right above the beer pyramid there is a large stain on the wall.  It could be either vomit or urine.  I\'m not getting close enough to check. A bug lands on my face.  I brush it off.  The street sweepers, both human and machine are out in full force.  One street crew greets me with a "Good Morning! Great Game last night!"  I nod, smile and and agree with a, "It sure was..."\n\nContinuing my odyssey, a few young women emerged from their apartment complexes, yawning and still rubbing their eyes, wearing Cavs jerseys and/or t-shirts.  Some checked the parking meter and some stood there blankly for a few seconds before acknowledging my masculinity and then making their way to the bus stop.  \n\nIt is a warm but quiet morning in downtown Cleveland.  There is a cool breeze coming off the lake and the only sounds I can really hear is the lull of traffic and the construction crews laying the fiber optic cable for the RNC under the sidewalk. |Cavaliers|11
are you lebron in a nike commercial?|Heat|1
yes|Cavaliers|1
Does Lebron stay and try to go for two or does he go back to Miami? His promise to Cleveland is fulfilled now and we all know he's talked how he'd like to play with wade again and I think wade is pretty close to the end. |Lakers|1
He should retire. Its embarrassing to win with assists from the refs\n||-11
Do you really think he leaves a team with Kyrie 24, Love 27, TT 24. He can be in the finals for at least 3 more years in a row. \nCan\xc2\xb4t wait to see what they can find in the off-season.|Cavaliers|1
I think it's either he stays in Cleveland or goes and plays with CP3. How much would you love to share Staples Center with LBJ?|[CLE] LeBron James|1
How would they pull that off? Trade griffin and picks for Lebron? That would be intriguing move for both teams. Griffin and Kyrie pick and roll could be dangerous. |Lakers|1
I don't see how in the world Lebron could justify asking for a trade from Cleveland.  He already left once.  To do it twice (especially after the front office basically let him build his own team) would be a TERRIBLE look for him.\n\nCP3 can come to CLE at the end of his career if he wants to chase a ring.  |Grizzlies|3
I mean, he does have a player option. Not sure if LA could afford him, but a trade wouldn't be necessary.|[CLE] LeBron James|1
He stays in CLE. He built this team||2
No way he goes back to Miami...Wade is way past his prime (as is Bosh), while Irving is just entering his.  All Lebron cares about is winning titles, and his best chance is with Cleveland.  |Grizzlies|2
Yeah, Irving proved a lot of people wrong this series. He really transformed into an animal. He stepped up his defense and showed he was the best offensive player on the court aside from LeBron, definitely the best from long range. His ball handling skills are absolutely dirty. I hope he does another Uncle Drew championship style. |76ers|1

I don't get how Kerr can play curry only 39 minutes in a finals game 7. I get that rest is important but doesn't curry himself wanna go all out and be there for his team?|Cavaliers|1
Kerr took him out a couple times when he picked up fouls. The real crime was his using so much Ezeli and Varejao |[CLE] Zydrunas Ilgauskas|2
You say that with so much confidence without bringing up the fact Bogut was out. ||1
I know Bogut was out but it was clear that the Cavs were at an advantage every time those two went on the floor. Especially Varejao. I love Andy but he's 33 and not really useful for anything but flopping these days. |[CLE] Zydrunas Ilgauskas|1
Does anyone have the sauce on when Varejao flopped super hard with Love on him? |Heat|1

With a bench of Kawhi, Aldridge, Lowry, Derozan, Cousins, Green, Curry, Thompson, Whiteside, Towns, Wiggins, Paul, Griffin. It's a weak bench, but they bring a lot of role players and hard workers, they can compete in this tough league.|Lakers|2
I find it amazing that after all this time without a Championship, Cleveland does it in the most 'screw you' manner possible. |Lakers|1
Incredible game. Happy for the cavs despite being a cavs hater in past years. Anything is possible!||1
Not taking anything from the Cavs, but Kerr could not gameplan around the loss of Bogut, say what you will but he was a strong force in the paint and provided the Warriors with the rim protection they so desperately needed.  Credit to Lebron and company for taking advantage of the very few weaknesses Golden State had, but as we saw the "Death Line-Up" couldn\'t provide paint protection from Kyrie and James and they were flat out exposed.  And yet again Klay Thompson seems to disappear in the Finals.||1
Miss me with that. Cavs were down Kyrie & Kevin last year. Let\'s not make missing a mediocre player on a "historic team" the reason for blowing a 3-1 lead.|Hornets|2
Hence why I said "Not taking anything from the Cavs"||1

No I know it's 100% regular season. But to say that no other player was more valuable than Steph is a fucking joke.||-2
Lol shut the fuck up||1
Even if it contradicts the name MVP isn't given to the the person who has the most impact on a team. It's the best player of the season.|Lakers|2
Too bad people will portray this series as Golden State *failing* rather than LeBron being the underdog AND coming back from 1-3.\n\nWhat an unbelievable series for LeBron though. The man was on a mission this whole series. That block towards the end was personification of his will to win a championship. |Lakers|0
I don\'t know. You got that Lebron "willing his team to the title" story built already with him leading points, rebounds, assists, steals and blocks. I could see it being described in the future as Lebron James taking the Cavs and overcoming a 3-1 deficit rather than Steph Curry and the Warriors collapsing (probably would have been different if the Warriors didn\'t win last year though).||2
Yeah. I definitely hope so. I should have prefaced I\'m a Chicago native before the downvote brigade came (recently moved to LA) so my social media feeds are a bit biased. \n\nMy Twitter and Facebook timelines are full of "not better than the 96 Bulls" memes.  LeBron has always been that hump the Bulls never got over so I guess there\'s a consolation in it for both sides, haha. |Lakers|1

I'm not even mad the Warriors lost honestly. I'm really glad Kyrie Irving got a ring, he legit deserves it. I feel like this  was less the Cavaliers series to win and more the Warriors' to lose. I know most people would consider me a bandwagoner because of when I started following the Warriors, but they gained a lifelong fan, and they reignited my interest in basketball. Hopefully that'll carry over to the next year and many years to come. \n\nThat being said though, I hate the mentality of a lot of the older basketball fans. I feel like if you even mention this Warriors' season in the future everyone will just laugh at you because they didn't win the Championship, but whatever, someone had to take the fall. It's just a shame it was this Warriors tean.|Warriors|0

First, Curry got hurt at the worst moment.  Just in time not to be able to heal for the moment.\nSecond, bye bye Barnes.\nThird, if anyone was thinking, dude, we're already g2g, why would we want Durant?  You're wrong.  Let's get Durant NOW!\n\nEdit:  Forth, Bogut has finally proven what we've known all along...he can't be counted on to be healthy when it matters most.\n\nIf the bargain is losing Bogut, Barnes, and back spasm Iggy for Durant, I think that's essentially an Iggy for Durant 1-for-1 swap, and a no brainier.||1

I will never forgive the warriors for this. Cleveland needed to stay America's punchline, the lovable losers, the city of misery, the factory of sadness and failure, but now they can brag that they are champions of something. \n\nThis puts the warriors up there with the Colts as yet another team that allowed a miserable city to not be miserable anymore, way to go assholes.\n\nThat being said, congrats to the new champions, enjoy your reign and stop being miserable for a few months (the Browns will make this right)||1

I was in here last year congratulating the Warriors on beating the Cavs and it feels great to win.\n\nGolden State is the greatest team in NBA history and this was a hard fought victory. No one gave the Cavs a chance. This was a five game series at best before game 1 according to the experts. After game two many people thought the series was over. Howevere, the Cavs slowly crawled back with stellar performances in games five and six. Game seven came down to the final minute.\n\nThis feels surreal to me after all the heartache I experienced as a fan of this team.|Cavaliers|1

another one to keep it company??|Cavaliers|2
4:40 left on the clock is when the game was tied up 89-89 (i double checked). I don't know why nobody else is mentioning it that the 3 pointer kyrie drained with a hand in his face was the first points either team scored in about 4 minutes. Crazy end to a game go cavs.||1
Everyone is mentioning that shot.|Heat|2
What if Draymond was never turned squirrel by that evil enchantress, he could have chase a ring instead of nuts.||1
I hate to say it but the cavs deserved to win, Golden state just played like shit. You can't have deadweight like Klay and Barnes in your line up. Both of those guys played like total scrubs. ||1
Barnes played well this year, and Klay was otherworldly. Just because they had a couple of bad games doesn\'t mean they\'re "deadweight"\n\nGive credit to Cleveland, but it doesn\'t mean GS is some horrible team. ||1
Playing well in the regular season doesn't mean shit when you shoot 2/22 in the finals. ||1
Well, it means you work on your game and come back stronger next year. Every fan out there would have Klay or Steph on their team.\n\nBut yeah, Barnes you can have.||1
Curry was no longer a playmaker. He was just hunting 32 foot shots. Lebron had him so shook.||3
Yup Curry got a little overconfident in his shot and it really bit him in the ass these last couple games. ||1
Cleveland won a Championship, the Cubs are the best team in baseball, the patriots won't start the season with Tom Brady under center...\n\nOMG THESE ARE THE END TIMES PEOPLE!

Who has the most championships?|Bulls|1
Bill Russell!  Lebron James still doesnt belong in that list.  Larry Bird might not either.||1
He has 11 titles and Jordan has 6. That's why they are one and two on my list. Just on pure clutch play Jordan will always be my top pick. If my life depended on the win, I'd pick him.|Bulls|1
Bill Russell was awesome.  I never knocked him.  I was saying Lebron does not belong on that short list.  I think Lebron is incredible, I do not mean to say that he is not a great ball player.  But I am not ready to compare him to the greatest players of all time.\n\nYou're also missing the all time scoring leader in NBA history.||1
How is he not top 3 at this point? |Timberwolves|9
he's lost many championships, choked in a championship, and has now been saved by his teammates making clutch 3's twice. hes top 5 but it's arguable he's not top 3. |Celtics|-4

The worse part is no matter who won. most of the people here can't just accept this was a good series. Had GSW won people would ride Curry's dick and call Lebron a choke artist. Can't we just enjoy the damn series and give credit where credits due.|Mavericks|1
Exactly. I was rooting for GSW but I sure as hell respect what the cavs have done. And if you're a cavs fan and the first thing you post after winning is fuck dray or curry you should be ashamed of yourself. It was an amazing game and that's all there is to it.||2

How much does this win invalidate the Warriors' title win last year? Golden State couldn't beat a full-strength Cleveland squad despite a 3-1 lead and a better team than last year.|Supersonics|-4
"Invalidate" is a bit harsh, and pretty much every team that wins a title plays a series/game against an injury-riddled team.  That said, last year\'s Finals probably play out differently if the Cavaliers are at full strength.|Supersonics|1
Good question. IMO unanswered. If they win next year, for example...||1
None they beat the team that was on the court. |Heat|2
warriors werent exactly at full strength either, curry has been banged up the whole playoffs, missing bogut, and obviously the suspension was a series changer||2
Who cares. They won one. We won one. |Cavaliers|3
If you discredit their win last season you have to discredit the Cavs this year after the Warrior lost Bogut and had a hobbled Iggy.\n\nIt's unfair to discredit anyone's championship win given how much randomness is involved year in and year out.|Grizzlies|8
While I agree slightly, if you are going to say kyrie and love are equal to bout and Iggy.... you are a fucking idiot||-2

Can't stub your wrist. He reacted like it was broken or sprained. I don't really have an issue with it. Just a bit annoying to see athletes like that exaggerate. |Supersonics|-7
Maybe he did sprain it. I mean he had no reason to exaggerate, the foul was already called. |Cavaliers|3
Yeah, perhaps it is hurt, but he shouldn't be taking the free throws if that is the case. If it is hurt, then okay, never mind.\n\nHe potentially does have a reason to exaggerate. |Supersonics|-2

Glad lebaby got a good blub in at the end and had the whole team hudled around him on a "hurt wrist" that he got right up and played on. That guy can play some fucking ball but damn does he bawl lol||-3
A lot of people seem to think that warriors fans are super depressed, but as an SF native I haven't really heard any crying. Everyone is really proud of the warriors, we have had an insanely stressful season and it sucks to lose but LeBron and the Cavs simply played better than us. We had 3 straight shots at closing out the series and we just couldn't do it. Steph and Klay looked completely gassed, Barnes had an incredibly bad impact on the series, too. Being 2-22 over two games is an enormous letdown that drastically impacted the outcome of the games. But that's just how it is, that's basketball. Going without Bogut was brutal on us, and not having Green for a game was, too. \n\nTo be honest, there's still so much life left in this warriors team that most of us are just anxious to get the next season rolling again. We want to see what these guys can do this coming year, they are obviously really good. Hopefully Green will have a cleaner playoff run and stay out of trouble, and hopefully we wont have injuries.\n\nLooking back at this season, this team literally crawled through the trenches to make it to the finish line. It sucks to have it slip away, but it's not like we lost to a bad team or something. We just lost fair and square, nothing wrong with that. \n\nP.S\n\nI feel exactly how I felt when OKC lost. A little cringey to lose 3 games when we were 1 away, but kind of in awe of how good the team performed, and super anxious to see how amazing they are in the coming season.|Warriors|-8
It sucks being on the losing end of an outright classic series. I hope that what we are seeing is a burgeoning championship rivalry. They are rare, and I think we are do for one. |Celtics|1
You say you lost fair and square to a good team, but that first paragraph really makes it seem like you don't want to give the Cavs any credit.|[CLE] LeBron James|6

i mean you can't put it all on him. warriors new what he could do. they had him in their to make lebron take those shots. so you gotta blame kerr for that imo|Heat|1
Very true. After the first minute of the first quarter, everyone in the room was questioning why Ezeli was still in the game. Then when Kerr put him back into the game in the second half, everyone was questioning what Kerr was thinking.\n\nI know he promotes trust in all his players, but when a player is playing like Ezeli, you have to keep him off the floor. The Cavs even picked several plays in a row to get the defense switch to Ezeli because they know he's the whole in the defense.\n\nI have to hand it to the Cavs, though, they played a great game and series, and Kyrie's clutch drew a dagger into the entire room.|Warriors|1
i guess its a combo of the bogut injury, the ai injury, and the harrison barnes meltdown. didn't trust death lineup and didnt have bogut|Heat|1

I am happy for lebron james(one of the greatest of all times is able to get another ring), but I am disappointed that he did it with the cavs. I hate it how so many cavs fan disrespected him after he left. The guy literally got offered(comparing it to a regular job) a higher salary, and what was basically a lot of opportunities for promotions(win rings), and the cleveland fans got pissed at him for taking that job offer. Then  the owner makes a stupid letter stating how lebron sucks and how they will win a ring before him and the cleveland fans burn his shirt and spit on his jersey. The go on and boo him, instead of giving him an applause, when his name is called out in "The Return". It is not like he went to your biggest rivals(Bulls? or Pistons?) that a booing would be justified. Well, they lose, the owner losses money, and everyone who said that they did not want him, instantly want him back because they suck, even after stating that they didn\'t want him back and disrespecting him. The only cleveland fans that should be celebrating tonight, are the fans like that guy who ran on to the court with the shirt saying come back.    \n    \ntdlr: Happy for lebron, cleveland fans that disrespected after he left can fuck off. Fans like James Blair can rejoice in the championship. |Lakers|0

Klay played like shit. Barnes did Barnes. Curry with the ridiculous turnovers. Green was the only person bringing it for game 7. Kerr with horrendous coaching decisions, specifically playing the failure Festus during the most crucial moment of the game. If he didn't make that terrible substitution the Warriors would've won the game. |Trail Blazers|0
Idk, I think steph kinda sealed this loss with the stupid behind the back pass to the front row and the pull up 3 in double coverage with almost 20sec on the shot clock|Clippers|1
Yes those were terrible decisions, but Festus is not a great player. The first 2 possessions of the game were ruined by him. Playing him did nothing positive for the Warriors, but he still brings him in during a very crucial moment. The Warriors were up by 4 before Festus committed the stupid big man foul on Lebron. This loss falls on Kerr's terrible coaching decisions. |Trail Blazers|1
Im an (irrational) Lebron hater, but grats to the cavs. The way Lebron played the last four or five games of this series was great. The block at the end of the game was incredible and if the warriors score there completely changes how the last two minutes were changed.\n\n||0
I'm proud of the Cavs for doing what they did, but I don't look forward to the Lebron>Jordan conversation. He's an all time great but he's not there yet fellas.|East|0
Jordan was amazing at preventing Cleveland from even coming close at a shot at a ring, but even Jordan would have had his work cut out for him getting them a ring.||2
Lebron missing the game-sealing dunk and hurting his wrist is the most Ohio way to end a game 7. Potentially the dunk of his life, on posters everywhere, and it misses PLUS a wrist injury. Imagine if he would have hit that..||0
He had the best defensive play in finals history and made that 3 point penalty happen.\n\nPlus he won, so no one is going to care about anything negative.||1

Whoever told you that has a serious case of The Salty^TM. I know you're just asking having not seen the game, but you should know the idea that this game was fixed (given how few fouls there were in the first place) is ludicrous. ||0
Oh I\'m sure, but not being a fan of the sport I\'m curious to how much the refs get away with, because I know in the NFL the refs consistently make stupid calls that change the outcome of the games whether it be because they are fixed or they are bad refs, but nobody really knows.\n\nWhat I read was this on twitter: "That was completely not a foul on Curry. All he did was stand there. And now he has 3 instead of 2 at the half? The NBA is totally crooked" \n\nedit: Also wanted to point out that fouling out Curry would turn the tables completely, so even though there was barely any fouls all game, all they need to do is foul out Curry. I am just really suspicious of the NFL, NBA and other multimillion dollar organizations and how easy it actually is to fix the games if they wanted. Lebron wins the championship they make more money than if Curry does.||1
A single shitty call is generally less impactful in basketball than in football.|Cavaliers|2
That's very true, no one play has as much of an impact than it can in football, but if you kick Curry out of the game (which I believe happened in their last loss) then you might as well give it to the Cavs.||1
Absolutely, but to do that with little warrant would be pretty egregious.|Cavaliers|1
Was it warranted to kick Curry out of that game? I wasn't sure if they did it because of the fouls or him accidentally hitting someone with his mouthpiece.||1
I actually missed that game, which is a shame, so I can't say with certainty. From context within this sub I think the mouthpiece throw was in frustration due to ejection. I don't think he suffered any consequence for throwing the mouthpiece.|Cavaliers|2
No, it really wasn't. There weren't any refs decisions that made a huge difference in the game and no big advantage either way. Both teams played well overall and it was an exciting game. ||2
I do keep hearing that, it was an exciting game, have never gotten into basketball, but watching Curry and Lebron highlights from some of the earlier games this series peaked my interest.||1

Ezeli lost the Warriors the game. As bad as the splash brothers played it was a close defensive game and neither team had much going. Ezeli then jumps in to lebron on a pump fake and lebron gets 3 free throws when warriors had a 4 point lead. That lead was huge at that point in the game and for how tight the game was being played. Really a huge mistake. Missed shots happen but that gave Cavs 3 points, momentum and cut the lead to one. |Cavaliers|0
Yeah, Kerr probably want that one back... He is a good coach though, if he hadn't adjusted last year, we would have stopped you and no championship for you.|Grizzlies|1
I'm a Cavs fan haha|Cavaliers|1
Congrats, man! Would have loved to meet you in the finals last year and had a wresling match|Grizzlies|1
Then the very next trip down, he thought LeBron was going to pump fake him again and stayed back and LeBron drains a quick 3 on him... Ezeli had it bad right from the word go with his botched dunks, blown layups... he was probably telling Kerr in the 4th quarter "you sure you want me in there, you got money on the Cavs?"|Heat|2
Happy for Lebron but gaaaad damn that man cries a lot|Bulls|-2
I will resort to my youth.\n\nI will never forgive such faggotry as I have seen from these bitchass Warriors. The Lakers, a real team, will have to take it from here.|Lakers|-3

Your are goddamn right|Lakers|1
The Best thing about King James going down as the GOAT is that the kobe fans killed themselves. EARNED not GIVEN, Unless you are a dead weight sidekick like kobe that never shows up in games that matter.|Heat|-5
The Lebron haters won\'t give in after this. They\'ve been too stubborn all this time that there\'s no reason to beleive they\'ll give up now. They\'re gonna be like "Deli CARRIED lebron to a title" |Raptors|1
Does not matter, Bye bye Jordan|Heat|-3
Like I said, I get to talk about a "healthy Warriors" squad like Cleveland did all year. There\'s no denying we were the most injured team this series.  Curry was hurt and I do think it affected his shot creation ability, Bogut was gone so we lost our best rim protector, and Iggy was extremely hobbled the last two games. Downvote if you want, they clearly weren\'t the same team they had been all year, and you\'re lying to yourself if you think the injuries didn\'t affect that. But even through all that I can still credit the Cavs for coming back, that\'s not easy no matter what. |Warriors|-14
So turn that around and be thankful you have even one ring. What a sore loser ||1
Yes, and? Injuries affected teams before just the finals.\n\nClippers played without Blake Griffin for the majority of the season and still made it as 4th seed. Then CP3 fractures his right hand through some minor, freak move in game 4. Austin Rivers gets absolutely wrecked as they go on.\n\nSo yeah, injuries affect teams. Pretty sure many of us are aware of that. Plenty of teams end up suffering injuries.\n\nThat being said, yes, GSW did have a lot of injured players in the finals though. But what can you do about it? That's just how the game goes.|Clippers|1
I'm legitimately only bringing it up because I hear ALL YEAR about healthy Cavs, and we finally get them with our team clearly more banged up. I'll live, but I'll be the reminder that we weren't 100% just like the vast majority of Cavs fans did last year. |Warriors|-2
No downvotes here, but as long as you think you were the rightful winners last year and Cleveland were the rightful winners this year, all is good. |Cavaliers|1
They were on the court playing,  Kyrie and Love were not even playing. |Heat|3
meh, they had a chance to win the game they had 2 wide open 3s in the 4th quarter they missed and another good look 3 from curry that rattled out i believe.  other than that iggy missed 2 fts and instead of going for a dunk on the fast break to at least draw contact he goes soft and lebron blocks the shot.  they were also up 8 early in the 3rd with a chance to put it away and blew that too||3
73 and nein|Clippers|7
Chokin' State Warriors\n\nHoly shit that was an awful fucking three games by GS. I fucking hate Lebron, but the Warriors deserved to be embarrassed. \n\nAlso, seriously Lebron do you have to cry like a child every time you win a game?|Hawks|-33
I feel the same. Dude hates being called a bitch but weeps at the drop of a hat. Get it together. Shit.||0
Well, he came back down from 3-1 and bought back a title to Cleveland since 1964. Yeah, I think emotions are in order. |Magic|1
Then don't whine when another player calls you a bitch. I just can't stand Lebron's fake bullshit.|Hawks|-4

You mean the team with the unanimous MVP who is the defending champ, who just set the all time regular season NBA record, couldn't take one game out of three against a team that without Lebron wouldn't make the playoffs? \n\nThat was a straight up choke job.|Hawks|0
Just seems like that's discrediting what Lebron and Kyrie did. Those two played some of the best basketball I've ever watched.|Nuggets|2

What's up with all the Lebron cock-sucking in this thread?\n\nI don't see how anybody could be a Lebron fan after seeing this: https://youtu.be/4fSlLdXNzPw||-6
You're an idiot ||1
Because I don't approve of flopping I'm an idiot? Lol okay.||-1
No, because you said no one should be a fan of one of the two best players ever because he\'s a "flopper" and can\'t understand why people are celebrating after he just came back from down 3-1 to the team with the best record in regular season history and led both teams in points, assists, rebounds, blocks, and steals. That\'s why you\'re a fucking idiot ||2
> one of the two best players ever\n\nLol hilarious. \n\n> because he\'s a "flopper" \n\nHe is a fucking flopper, did you watch the video? Or videos, because there\'s more. Jordan, Kobe, Steph, nobody flops like Lebron. Without those flops-to-fouls he got, they would have lost easily. He\'s not a great player. He\'s a great flopper.\nBut I see its pointless talking to you, seeing as how you could watch a slowed down, HD video clearly showing Lebron not be hit but fake like he is (like in the videos), and you would still take his cock down your throat, balls and all. The only person who\'s a fucking idiot here is you buddy.||0
Any logic to back up that first claim? Probably not, judging from you. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/G6_VPFiHOf4 oh shit Jordan isn't great anymore. \n\nhttps://youtu.be/NKuKCst6wms neither is Kobe. \n\nI don't even need to show you a video for Steph||1
A 30 second and 28 second video of one "flop" each from Jordan and Kobe, which both didn\'t result in any fouls vs a **5 min compilation** of Lebron\'s flops with nearly everyone resulting in a foul? You think those compare? Lol and you call me illogical. It\'s funny how you can\'t deny he bad he flops too.||0
Jordan Compilation:  https://youtu.be/7WR86xLSITc\n\nEvery player flops. It's nothing new. Look up Kobe Flop and Steph Flop on YouTube and you'll have 10 or 15 one minute videos. No one has made a compilation yet. Honestly all this does is show how little you watch the game ||1
That's not a flop compilation idiot. Did you check the link before you posted? Lmao. No every player does not flop. And the fact that you've convinced yourself that shows how big of a Lebron stan you are. Floppers like Lebron ruin the game. If you are really great you don't need to flop. Period. Like I said, without those flops + his constantly crying to the refs the Cavs would have lost. I know you Lebron stans don't mind it, but any real basketball fan does not want to see a flopper get to the top by flopping.||1
Idk, the fact that there's a lot of real basketball fans here and your original post was in the negatives shows you are kind of wrong ||1
I like him even more now, thanks |Bulls|1
Lebron fans support flopping so it's not unexpected. ||-1

Rather sad performance by Klay and Curry. Warriors didn't score from the 4:39 mark in the 4th quarter when they tied it. Credit to LeBron for winning but aside from that block he got lucky the Warriors just played worse in the last 4 minutes of that game.|Lakers|-3

Awesome night of basketball and they are nuking everything.  \n\nMessaged them asking them why they are nuking discussions and was told by u/iamtheraptor that only things they deem interesting get to stay. \n\nI asked him why some of their shitposts which are not interesting at all have stayed, and then he muted me.  \n\nCan't defend their actions, don't want to let reddit function the way it's supposed to. \n\nPower tripping mods on reddit once again,  who could have imagined it?\n\nGuess they must have been bullied in school or haven't been laid in a while or something...  Its the only explanation I can think of for power tripping and stifling conversation on the Internet.  ||-10

LeBron once again gets bailed out by a teammate in crunchtime. The real MVP this series was Kyrie.|Pistons|-6
Or maybe a team works together to win?\n\nBut Kyrie's shot was beautiful. And Lebron's athleticism is still unparalleled, but still...teamwork or something.|Clippers|1
Lol triple double and possibly the greatest block in nba history \n\nGood thing Kyrie came out wanting to win as much as he did cause you need a whole team to win a team sport fam ||2
Jason Kidd was a triple double machine, but yet he barely cracks the top 50 so what kinda point is that. As far as being the greatest block you have a lot of learn son https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QJ4iwqnLKc|Pistons|1
Bruh I'm aware of that block but tie game 7 with under two minutes left and a chance to come back 1-3 against the winningest team in nba history? Think about the context for a second. And once again same context with a triple double, 20+ points (which is considered a fantastic game if you're anyone but Lebron) and coming off back to back 41 point games  to keep your team in the nba finals? \n\nYou're joking if you think Lebron isn't the mvp. You'd have to be Ayesha Curry levels of salty tbh.||1
Give me a break man.  The two 41 point games prior he had got them the title.||2
Truth hurts LeBron fans I see. Kyrie averaged 27pts in the series and hit the biggest shot of the night to win it all. LeBron couldnt hit jack shit in the last 5 minutes.|Pistons|-1
Lebron led the entire series in a lot of really positive, really important stats. You either are trolling or you're oblivious or you're retarded. Pick one.|Cavaliers|0
I'll pick the one where I'm right. Fact LeBron couldnt score the last 5 minutes. If he continued to shoot and not get Kyrie involved it would have gone to overtime.|Pistons|0
>If he didn't play basketball as the team game that it's supposed to be played as it would have gone into overtime.\n\nNice try.|Cavaliers|0
Kobe > LeBron|Pistons|0
Nothing this man can do will stop the haters.  Move on. ||1
Haters? More like truth tellers.|Pistons|1
Just to make yourself sound more stupid, he officially led both teams in avg points, blocks, assists, rebounds, and steals.  He almost averaged a triple double.  Go to sleep. ||1
With the way he was shooting for the last 5 minutes that wouldn't have amounted to jack if Kyrie didnt hit that clutch 3.|Pistons|1
But, but, but... Never ends with you fools. ||1
Fixed|Pistons|1
That's just asinine. Cavs won this series as a team but LeBron is 100% the deserving MVP.|Cavaliers Bandwagon|2
Lmao, u can't be srs. There would be no championship with kyrie, who is a legit superstar, but dude Lebron had a triple double ||3
Idk anything about basketball... Why is this so important and has so many upvotes? Is it because it's like the fifa world Cup of NBA? ||-9
International competition isn't that big of a deal in the nba because the usa is so dominant and the nba is miles ahead of the next best league. So this is the biggest it gets.|[NBA] LeBron James|3
Not exactly. It's not an international tournament, but the United States (plus Toronto) are miles ahead of the rest of the world in basketball. This was huge for a number of reasons\n\n1) the fall of the greatest regular season team in basketball history, the 73-9 Warriors\n\n2) the end of a half-century long championship drought for Clevelands 3 major sports teams\n\n3) the first team ever to go down 3-1 in the finals (best of 7) and come back to win it|[CLE] Zydrunas Ilgauskas|4

You know, it\'s one thing for a team to play their hardest and try their best.  But to only score 13 points in the final quarter of a game seven?  That indicates a team that just quit trying.  And that\'s shameful.  It\'s unsporsmanlike.  \n\nIn addition to the shame of losing, I think the NBA should open a fraud/gambling investigation into the GSW players for potentially "throwing" the score.  And potentially ban some of these players Pete Rose-style.|Bullets|-1

I\'m usually a lurker..but "Lebron and Kyrie had similar stat lines" was too ignorant to ignore. I can see why you would argue for Kyrie as MVP (he was super clutch all series long). But about the only stat that Lebron and Kyrie were similar in was PPG...Lebron averaged way more assists/rebounds and also averaged more steals/blocks. |Grizzlies|1

I get that people get really into sports and the Cavs winning is going to give a short chance for catharsis in Cleveland.

What was up with it? Cavs just won. He's caught up in the moment, he's fucking pumped. He's overcome with emotions that people rarely get to feel. In the moment, he can brag all he wants. It was literally seconds after the buzzer. Let him have it.|Clippers|2

Lebron the GOAT. Lebron took a team of rejects and losers ( kyrie, Love, JR, Shumpert, RJ) and just made them champs. Probably the best finals game ever, close from start to finish, refs were perfect, the impossible comeback on a road game. \nJR SMITH NBA Champion, let that sink in. \n\nDo you know how many 70+ wins teams Michael Jordan, Kareem and Kobe beat in the play-offs? 0...|Cavaliers|-5

Okay bye. We get youre salty, but GS just got beat. Green got himself suspended. Curry cant play D and fouled out. So bye, we dont need "fans" like you.|Suns|1
Lol I'm a neutral.  Curry can't play D? Really? I'm pretty sure watching any game he's played this season could disprove that. Green getting suspended was a joke. Even the ref that exposed the while league as rigged said it was undeniable that they did it to further the series when it was in jeopardy of ending too early.  Curry would never have gotten those calls any other time of the year and they weren't calling anything on James, as usual. I would be happy for Cleveland if they deserved it. I'm no hater.  There's just no getting around what happened and how obvious it was. ||0
Curry was an absolute liability on D all series. Did you notice that once he didn't have Bogut to play help D, LeBron and Irving waited until Curry switched on to them to do anything.\n\nNot calling anything on LeBron? How about calling anything for LeBron, he was assaulted going to the rim with no calls, made him settle for jumpers. \n\nCLEVELAND ARE WORLD CHAMPS, AND THE WARRIORS COULDN'T STOP THEM\n\n the refs didn't miss their open looks, the refs didn't out rebound the warriors, the refs didn't make Curry play dumb for most of the finals. |Suns|1

They lost down 3-1 in the finals.\n\nAnd up 2 or 3 in the 4th shouldn't count for blowing a 4th quarter lead. 2 to 3 point lead in NBA is nothing.\n\nThis is the ultimate choke.|Thunder|0

I'm gonna take my upvotes to south beach.\n\nWhat a fucking joke.  Silver is fucking jerking LeBron off like none other.\n\nBurn those jerseys Cavs fans.  Wait.  No.  Now you're buying them.  Fucking traitors.\n\n\nLeBron fucked you over and you love him.  Fucking cucks.||-3

I'm here for the karma, GO CAVS!!! THE DROUGHT IS OVER!!!||-4
If Harrison Barnes is only marginally better, Warriors win. The amount of possessions that ended with a Barnes wide open shot going nowhere close was too damn high. Lebron played like the legend he is, massive credit to him. However given the circumstances of the Warriors players being hurt, I\'m gonna trumpet the new "healthy Warriors" argument all year.|Warriors|-3
The Warriors just aren't a very efficient offense.  They are more an equivalent of a hurry-up offense in football that is relying on sheer volume of plays / possessions to generate points.  Curry is incredibly sloppy as a point guard and tonight it really cost the Warriors.  Also the Warriors kept feeding the ball to the likes of Ezeli and Varejao tonight which has to be inefficient by any standard of actually trying to score points.||-1
Except the Warriors had a 114 offense rating, i.e 114 points per 100 possessions, higher than anyone else in the league (followed by OKC, Cleveland, and San Antonio).||1
You're making it seem like none of the Cavs players struggled as bad or sucked. Warriors had more players step up than the Cavs did, but the Warriors' best players didn't consistently, while the Cavs did. Curry lost them this series on BOTH ends. ||1
Barnes is supposed to be the number three scoring option and he looked like number two.  Curry wasn't the same post injury and if you think that's an excuse, fine, but it is what it is. I don't think the Cavs win without the Draymond suspension giving them life but oh well, can't change that. |Warriors|1

Manufactured championship ||-10
The only comeback from 3-1 will remain a mess of refereeing and I don't see myself coming back to see these games in the future. Not a memorable finals or a great victory as far as I'm concerned. Eastern part of the play-offs were without much concurrence, it's like the Cavaliers were in the finals before it started.\n\nI'd like to see James win a title by beating consecutively a team like Portland, then the Spurs, then Golden State, then the best East team. Not have a ticket to the final and win with some controversy. A true victory would be nice.\n\nDownvote if you agree.||-21

>Not a memorable finals or a great victory as far as I'm concerned.\n\nlol are you kidding me bro?|Celtics|1
That's my opinion. You can think this was a great finals and re-watch it many times and enjoy it, and I won't stop you, good for you. For me it was pretty dreadful and ugly the way it turned out, not my kind of games. I have other finals from the past that I enjoy tons more and I will continue to re-watch in the future. Not this one.||0
Cry harder|Cavaliers Bandwagon|1
I'm disappointed that's all.||0
So great to see goodness finally win out over selfishness and greed. Lebron became a hero again when he chose community over his own selfish needs and it's great to see Cleveland get the win. \n\nNow, let's roll back these ridiculous free agency rules and go back to a time when players stayed on their team and played for love of the game, their team, and their community. R/nba should be ashamed of itself.||-12
Basketball not baseketball||1
Lol what ridiculous free agency rules. The current rules if anything give teams more power to keep their best players. Salary cap + bird rights allows teams to offer a better package to the players they already have. |[CLE] Zydrunas Ilgauskas|1
Congratulations Cleveland Crybabies, you won the most corrupt NBA Finals ever! Hope Congress Investigates the NBA after this unethical handling of a "professional" sport. ||-4
Crazy series but i thought this game was terrible.  Both teams with some weak shooting and both had plenty of chances to pull away with big shots.  Only Kyrie and draymond were consistently hitting.||-2
Cleveland doesn't deserve this. Dan Gilbert doesn't deserve this. Sure, Warriors deserved to lose after choking 3-1, but Cleveland didn't deserved to win. |Warriors|-12

So the formula for winning is simple... Get 3 first overall picks in the draft and have the leagues best player choose you in free agency all within 5 years, get the league to hand you a road win and voila! Champs!|[UTA] John Stockton|-12
Lol, so you need to be the best team? Color me surprised ||2
Haha. Yeah, in the nba, you need a superstar ||3

We here. Yawp. They not. Nope. Warriors suck. Yawp. GTFO. Yawp.|Cavaliers|8
Umm... Oakland ||12
Tired of the fucking NBA.  \n\nRefs are obviously instructed and coached - either to help a team win outright or keep games close by destroying momentum.  \n\nWarriors were an absolutely far superior team that the Cavaliers were allowed to foul the shit out of for the sake of LeBron's legacy (of not being called for offensive fouls), and Cleveland sports (who honestly gives a shit).\n\nYou could see how the refs fucked up game 7 right about when the Warriors went up by 7, few touch fouls on the Warriors, few hacks allowed by Cleveland, and the Cavs are back in the game with momentum and the Dubs are rightfully frustrated instead of up by 20.\n\nThese refs are fucking professionals, they know how to do this shit subtly so most of you idiots don't even notice.\n\nMaybe the Warriors should bring Metta World Peace in to fuckin hack some bitches and scare the refs that he's gonna come to their house and eat their children if the Warriors don't win (don't actually mean that, from his skateboarding video he seems like a nice guy).|[NYK] Charles Oakley|-26
Shouldn't you be more mad at your front office for trading away your first rounder for Bargnani instead?|76ers|1
[Don't feel bad. There is always next year](http://i.imgur.com/Lsbj55c.jpg)||1
This was the best basketball game ive ever saw. Referees did perfect, no crazy calls, no doubts, players gave their best, game was close from start to finish. Lue gave Kerr a lesson on timeouts and rotation. 7 player rotation the whole game.\nBut you, you like chokers. Bet you would love to choke on a GSW dick multiple times.|Cavaliers|2
The NBA has issues, but let Cleveland have their day. |Celtics|2
"having their day" vs. best team winning.|[NYK] Charles Oakley|-10
The best team wouldn't lose three games in a row. |Celtics|10
So you think there's a magnet or something in the ball to make the Warriors miss shots at the end and Cleveland make them? Who has the remote control, Adam Silver?|[CLE] LeBron James|3
whatever you say, Ayesha Curry |Raptors|8
She's a smart lady.|[NYK] Charles Oakley|-7
I quit watching the NBA a few years ago. It turned to shit for me. This playoffs reinforced that idea. I was a Pistons fan and I do miss it but can't go back. I hate Lebron. Couldnt stand him. I don't know why he irked me but he did. Maybe it was his fans calling him the greatest and him nicknaming himself King James but I never wanted him to win a single championship. He had to go to Miami to an all star studded team to win and it pissed me off. He screwed his city over. He couldn't build a team. He cannot be the best because he left for a team that wasn't built. Then he went back to Cleveland with a pretty good team. It wasn't built from the ground up but I don't care anymore. \n\nThis playoffs with Green royally pissed me off. I wanted the Warriors to go down as the best because I hate the Bulls. Jordan can fuck himself. I don't view him as the best ever because he isn't. Wilt is the greatest in my view. Many come and many go. Green kicks Adams in the nuts and wasn't  suspended.  You know something is up there. Anyway, congrats Cleveland. Although I still not a huge fan of Lebron your city deserved a title and I'm happy for you. Hopefully Durant can get a couple. ||-5
Hahaha suck a dick ||2
Who the fuck cares about this rigged finals. Plus the new episode of  Game of Thrones was way better than the whole series. ||-7
So Allen and now Irving. 2 of the biggest shots in the history of NBA. LeBron is very lucky he plays/played with them.||-6
Well surely is better than playing with the FIRST UNANIMOUS CHOKERS in the NBA.|Cavaliers|1
Do the names John Paxon and Steve Kerr ring any bells?||6
Oh get out of here. Horry and Fisher hit multiple clutch shots for Kobe and no one says he was 'lucky' to play with them.|Cavaliers|11

Do millennials think it's neat to cry or something? Queen James is an embarrassment to American sports. Grabbing his wrists like an infant then pointing at his teammates seconds later like a chump at the bar.||-25
Then making his free throw to make it a two possession game and winning it all. Yep, you're right man. If only he were as tough as you. |76ers|2
I still can't figure out why Lue was crying after the game. C'mon.|[CLE] LeBron James|-12

Pretty pathetic the Cavs needed Adam Silver to rig the entire finals for them to pull it off.. You Cavs fans should not feel good about your tainted championship victory tonight..  Your team is a total joke, composed of cry baby cheaters, and your city is a crime ridden cesspool of despair.... Hopefully  you braindead Cavs fans will\ndo us all a favor tonight and burn it to the ground||-40
Isn't Oakland a crime ridden cesspool of a city too?|[MIL] Giannis Antetokounmpo|1
As a 20 year bay area resident, originally from Chicago. Comments like these make my day. Been watching the dubs for the last 15 years and have never been annoyed with the fans till this year. The entitlement! Watching all the disappointed tech millionaire "fans" file out disappointed after spending 15-20k on a ticket. Priceless. "Don\'t mean a thing without the ring." ||1

no matter what, there will always be that fan who thinks the game is rigged somehow.||3
Of course, there's a lot of history there|Mavericks|-8
Too bad it took 3 choke jobs from the best team of all-time. Choakland.|Cavaliers|2
I'm a Mavs fan.  After 2006 I just take exception to screw jobs from  the league office|Mavericks|1
If the league is rigged why aren't major market teams like Nets, Knicks, Sixers, and Wizards relevant?|76ers|3
I think the NBA rigged the playoffs to extend the series' to game 7's for profit purposes! I have lost a good amount of respect for the league.. Are we not going to question this obvious game manipulation? The authority in NBA basketball and the manipulation of the game is seriously suspect it needs to be researched upon by qualified people like the FBI. Something is going on here, its not good for the sport and it needs to be stopped.  There are multiple suspect moments in these playoffs that really are starting to come to light. I think these refs are directed to be sensitive to certain players and spin games a certain way, which benefits all the owners of all the major corporations that run this event. So they can drive nicer cars and live in bigger houses and in doing so, fuck all of the fans/teams over and make sports uncomfortable to watch and probably even play. Its not even fun to view this painfully obvious rigging, its so clear to me that the NBA, NFL has its dirty, greedy hand in the games. ||-22
You know that the TV contract (the **big** money) is already determined and isn't changed with more games added? Right?|[CLE] LeBron James|1
Based on what |[NBA] LeBron James|2
Disagree, the better team over the 7 games won. The refs made bad calls but that happens all the time in every sport I don't think you can point to that and say that the NBA is rigged.|Pelicans|2
