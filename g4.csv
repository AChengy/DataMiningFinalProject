that was some LeBron and Kyrie stat padding in the end|Pistons|16
Did they legitimately take ONE three in the last 90 seconds of game time? I don't remember one. Just let LBJ drive to the hole for a layup, using 15-20 seconds every time, matched by Steph or Klay hitting free throws...it's just pure stat padding. So confusing. So disheartening for Cavs fans, I'd think. |Warriors|401
What happened|NBA|1
This.. Was fuming ||1
I was screaming at them for the last few minutes of the game. Just roll up and pop fucking threes, maybe get an offensive rebound. That's your only chance to even tie the game. But they played like they were up by ten points. ||1
Obviously they wanted a three but I don't think they could get one off with Warriors over playing them and forcing the drive |Raptors|4
[deleted]||-11
people here don't, they just see someone make a comment and then they upvote it if it fits the narrative they want to force.|Cavaliers|-2
but jacking up threes was their ONLY hope then. just going to the hoop is suicidal.||24
Why are comments like this getting down voted. Fucking r/nba|Pistons|4
These comments are exactly what Reddit is supposed to be for. Discussing. All of this is relevant and shouldn't be downvoted. |Knicks|3
Right. To lessen the lead trading layups forme free throws is pointless, unless the ft shooters suck. Even if you are 0 for 20 from 3, you have to try. It is not like the Cavs don't have shooters|Celtics|4
There is 0% chance the cavs win by going for layups down 9 with 40 seconds to go when they are trading pts with two good FT shooters on GS. Jacking up 3s would've at least have given them a chance to catch up instead of simply treading water.|Rockets|31
[deleted]||-15
[deleted]||0
No, he's actually objectively wrong. The correct line of play for the cavs in the closing minute was to start jacking 3's, it was literally their only chance at a comeback.\n\nThe chance of hitting a couple of 3's is objectively higher than going for a layup and hoping to steal the inbound and turn it into another layup multiple times. It IS like he's wrong because he is wrong period, there isn't even a discussion.||2
So you truly think the chances of the cavs getting a steal or an and1 is higher than them making a three?|Rockets|2
Regardless of them not making 3s all game you have to go for 3s down 9 with under a minute to play if you want a chance to win it. If you keep trading 2s with the other team you might as well just dribble out the game instead because all you're doing is stat padding at that point.|Supersonics|8
It's kinda funny to watch this Cavs team unraveling.  All we heard about all postseason was how they were raining threes and how the three-ball had changed their offense.  Apparently it's easier to shoot the three over historically bad playoff teams than historically great teams.  Who knew?|Warriors|3
No, LeBron immediately drove - the only way what you are saying is true is if the only person the Cavs wanted to take a 3 was LeBron. Which, I guess is true - but egregiously bad coaching and/or gameplay by LeBron. You can't trade layups for fouls against Curry and Thompson who are NOT going to miss at the line. #math |Warriors|35
I think the plan was to defend and go for a steal after a bucket. That was only the plan though. Not exactly what happened |Warriors|2
That assumes the Cavs can play defense (besides Lebron and Shump).\n\n|Heat Bandwagon|2
How is it confusing? Lebron has been pulling this shit for his entire career.||4
It wasn't so much the lack of taking threes. It was just that Curry and Klay so easily got the ball on the ensuing inbound. Curry got it uncontested a couple of times. Just poor effort for an NBA finals 4th quarter. I know it was probably futile anyway, but jeez...||5
LeBron literally waited for the defence to get to their formation before driving to the hoop. Like what the fuck? You don't even have a mid-range junper and you let the opponent get to their defensive formation?||48
And yet he wasn't driving at all earlier in the game when it might have actually helped. What the fuck. |[LAL] Smush Parker|56
Yeah super weird. Like you have 2 nearly 90% free throw shooters how are you going to make up an 8 pt deficit by making layups? \n\nEdit free throw ||116
It's lebrons best play by far. It's almost a sure thing when LeBron goes to the rim. Irving isn't far behind on that. It isn't a shooting team unless the opponent is awful.||0
I think they're planning on a steal,  and to be fair they went straight to the rack each time,  it was more like 8 sec per play|Wizards|5

I literally can't even, especially when I hear that Blatt was totally holding this team from a title this year.   \n  \nSeems like either he wasn't holding them back, or neither Blatt or Lue are (unless the Cavs make NBA history with the 1-3 Finals comeback) both not up to the task...or it's beyond good/competent coaching and there is an issue in the locker room/roster. You've all heard this narrative a million times though and we'll never really know so it's hard to say. |Warriors|3

Let's make Lebron and Kyrie dribble for 10s at the top of the key.\n\nEveryone that said Lue is a better coach than Blatt looks like an absolute fool now.|Rockets|362
I feel like no coach that can't donate their player can work against Lebron. \n\nPop would have seated both of them for playing hero ball for too long if his plan was ball movement.||2
I don't get it.  Even the GSW seemed to stand around when they were down.  Curry drives and the rest of the team just stands there, I guess waiting for that pass for the three.  Later they seemed to go back to moving the ball around and cutting.|[LAL] Mark Madsen|2
Who the fuck did? Even if they dominated their division, my view hasn't changed. Blatt is by far a better coach. Lue has no head coaching experience, compared to Blatt. CLE management really needa to go. So bad.||9
Lebron didn't like Blatt though so you can hardly blame management for listening to their face of franchise||1
Bullshit. You should only listen to your star player that much. Decisions are made by the management, not players. If they wanted to fire Blatt, then hire a good coach instead of a newbie.||1
Kinda hard to find good coaches mid season don't you think? I agree with you but Lebron is literally the Cavs and he could choose free agency any year now and they go back to being irrelevant.||1
And they won't win a trophy by listening to LBJ. The reason why the Bulls won in the 90s was because the management hardly considered MJ's decisions. Well yah it's hard to find a good coach mid-season, so they shouldn't have fired Blatt.||1
>They should just move.  \n  \nFTFY. I hear Baltimore is a nice location.|Heat|2
>Who the fuck did?\n\nYou're joking right? You could find tons of comments with hundreds of upvotes about this exact thing when Lue was winning 10 playoff games in a row. Some people were unconvinced and still saying that Blatt did just as well in the playoffs, but that was not even the majority opinion.|Rockets|17
Those were bandwagons man. Real analysts would still pick Blatt over Lue. Experience wise he stomps Lue. See what CLE did last year against GSW? Lue had no head coaching experience which means he'll most likely choke on pressure situations, compared to Blatt. ||0
he wasn't playing though. it's the responsibility of the players to trust each other||6
Exact same thing could be said about Blatt.|Rockets|8
Yup but if this was blatt they probably wouldn't be in the finals. Looked like he'd completely lost the team. I'm just saying you can't say lue is better than blatt if  blatt would have had the same or worse result||1
The team had a better record when Blatt got fired than they had with Lue the rest of the season|Knicks|1
If your remember correctly they played one of the weakest schedules to start the season and near the end of his tenure they were losing to the nets. Also the ball movement and the number of assists look much better now. I honestly think without buyin from your team you are fucked||1
That lost the team narrative is getting old. Lebron kicked him out and put in someone that wouldnt bust his balls.||2
It may be getting old but it's probably true. I'm not saying he's a bad coach, just that if he's lost a locker room (even through no fault of his own) he's got to go (just bad luck if you will)\n\nAlso don't you remember there was no ball movement under his system and they were losing to really crappy teams  near the end. like the nets before he got fired. I think it was was harsh but something had to be done. ||1
I think that Blatt would have been a sucessful coach in this league if he had coached a team that didnt have Lebron on it. Lebron just changes the dynamic so much|Celtics|5
Lue literally said during the game he wants to see more ball movement.|Cavaliers|20
Which led to...|Rockets|12
Lebron is the coach.||32
Well, when you dribble, you move the ball up and down.|Heat|29
I don't think Lue wanted that, he was ragging on them earlier for not moving it. Kyrie and LeBron just developed tunnel vision|Cavaliers|8
I'm a Blatt fan, and prefer him to Lue for the most part. But I think the iso's are Lebron and Kyrie's doings. They're just playing hero ball and downright ignoring the offensive schemes|Cavaliers|40
That's exactly what Westbrook and KD did down the stretch and that killed their momentum|Lakers|46
Makes you wonder what the warriors are doing to encourage that sort of play, or if both the Cavs and Thunder just start fucking up toward the end of big games. |NBA|7
[deleted]||4
What they're also doing is being a good team. Every player contributes and there is always someone else that can play if someone is in foul trouble. Couldn't see a lot of the game yesterday but a team that plays hero ball will never beat a good team.\n\nA similar thing happened to Lebron vs the Spurs in 2014 and look at how that ended.||5
I don't understand it... Why was Tristan Thompson on the bench when he was manhandling us? Why the hell was Channing Frye in that early? What the hell were the refs doing during the game? Was Lue paid to watch 2 players play iso? I'll take the win, no lie, but wth was going on.|[GSW] Stephen Curry|943
You want him playing 48 minutes?||1
Find out next time on dragon ball Z|Rockets|1
It's all a part of the Tyron Lue strategy. Let golden state go up 3-1 and get real confident, then, and then profit. ||1
Coach Lebron likes iso.|Cavaliers|1
He had 5 boards in the first 8 minutes, finished with 7. GSW's rotation exposed him time and time again.\n\n||1
Why they come up with the witness protection?\nWhy they let the Terminator win the election?\nCome on, pay attention!\n||1
Easy answer. Lue is not Finals coach material. I've been resenting Cleveland for firing Blatt. He is a better coach than Lue, by far. This hasn't changed a bit even if CLE dominated their division. Lue is a choker coach.||2
It also seems like LeBron could have thrown up about a dozen floaters from literally right in front of the basket with a smaller guy on him. Instead he threw so many of those bullet sideswipe passes to players like Smith and Shump. I'd rather go down with him missing those shots in close than Shumpert making another terrible play on a kick out.||2
TT was on the bench for spacing. He can get rebounds but that's it. The Warriors could collapse in the paint with him there where Channing could space the floor with his shooting|Heat|2
There was some good analysis about the rotations tonight. That last 6-7 minutes of the 4th was an example of a well-rested Warriors starting 5 going up against a gassed group of Cleveland starters. TT was actually in on all those plays where warriors were getting offensive rebounds (like Iggy rebounding and passing out to Barnes for the 3), but the Cavs were running on tired legs.\n\nLue's tactical inexperience definitely had an impact on the game and led to the stretch where the Warriors ran away in the 4th.|Warriors|4
0-5 FTs, easy hack target. I would still roll with Thompson after seeing Frye play though, he's not getting open at all.|NBA|405
He's been quality from the line so far this series though. Dont know what happened with him tonight|Lakers|1
He's 0-3 in 4 games. 3 frkn shots in 4 games? |[GSW] Andris Biedrins|2
The Frye hype the past couple weeks is unreal to me. I've been watching him since beasting at AZ days. He isn't garbage obviously, and I'm certainly not getting at that, but he had a couple good games and people were talking about him like he is the Cavs savior. I believe his best year was about 15 and 6. He hits a few big shots, now he's the stretch 4 the Cavs have been looking for. lol. \n\n|NBA|2
Thompson also stopped getting boards. He had 5 in the first quarter and ended up with 2 in the next 3 quarters.|Cavaliers|2
0-5 doesn't mean anything. He's a 61% shooter on the year (i.e. barely worse than JR). You'd love for them to hack Thompson every time.|[NYK] Jared Jeffries|5
Channing's been negated by the Warriors switching everything. He got hot after getting a few shots from confused defenders leaving him wide open.|Heat|3
Yeah, but with 2 minutes left, he needs to be on the floor. And even if it's hack-a-Thompson, in a physical game, they sacrificed their rebounding advantage for... Frye? So that they could just play iso and not give Frye the ball?|[GSW] Stephen Curry|6
Yea but honestly the only reason GS got going was all the fucking rebounds. The Cavs control the tempo when TT is in cause the dude dominates the shit out of the middle.\n|Lakers|184
The rebounds are what changed the game IMO. It was a close game, and they put up a stat about TT beasting on the boards. GSW started getting tons of second and third chances though and that just blew the game up. (relatively speaking of course, it was still close at the time.)|NBA|56
Once bovut had that massive block and the 3 was hit off the dray assist to bring them within 1 it was over.|Raptors|1
That was certainly a major part of it.  At a macro level, I'd say the game started to change as it got more physical and the Warriors specifically started to up the physical play.  The blocks, the turnovers, and the rebounds.\n\nThe rotation and minutes for TT is one of at least two, possibly many more, things that Lue botched tonight.  The other being that he seemingly forgot about the MVP when he should have been running Deli at him as he got heated up.|Warriors|5
but most of those came off of Love with TT on the bench|Warriors|10
Seriously their offense is so lazy I can't believe how they literally go five or more possessions in a row with iso ball just to jack up a three or long contested shot. Not even just Kyrie and his blackhole ballstopping ass, or LeBron's awful J, but when they go into iso mode everybody else literally just stands there and before you know it the shot clock is at 5 and nobody has moved. God forbid they set screens for each other or make any movement off the ball. It's just like the Thunder in games 5-7 except the Cavs run the clock all the way down before chucking where as the Thunder just ran up the court and chucked. ||365
And they let go David Blatt who's a offensive genius, scrap his offense before they even gave a fair try. |Lakers|6
Yeah can't argue that he got a shit deal. Being a Head Coach has to be a tough job for real. Those owners are savages.||2
Oh please I am sure Lebron had some say in the firing of Blatt that is the benefit of being the head of the franchise.||3
Well obviously, no Owner is going to consider not discussing such matters with their best player, especially the best player in the world. That's just foolish. But the Owners have the final say and all the power. They are absolute savages, and it has been well shown for the past 2-3 seasons. You can't blame LeBron for Mark Jackson, Frank Vogel, Scott Brooks, Tom Thibodeau and more. I mean, you could try, but please....\n\nI really don't think Blatt would have made much of a difference over Lue though. The Cavs just don't have the sustained effort that they should on both offense and defense. That is their problem. Especially on offense.||3
I hear you but let's all be real Lebron for Cleveland is like Indy when Peyton was there the team is nothing without them which gives them a lot of say in a lot of decisions. I don't think there is anything Cleveland can do to improve to next year is the sad part the gap between the East and the West is just so large right now we might see Curry get 6 rings or more if he stays healthy and there is always OKC or the Spurs if they falter all of which are probably better then the Cavs right now.||1
I hear you as well but let's be real about it all not just the relationship of the player and owner. The gap isn't that big between the Cavs and all those teams if there even really is one. A lot of it comes down to matchups. The Thunder simply choked that series away all they had to do was attack the basket and stop chucking and they failed to do so just as the Cavs are now. They've also proven to be awful against LeBron in the past. \n\nThe Cavs could have won game 1 of this series if they didn't force so much iso and didn't miss all their bunnies throughout the game. They literally couldn't make a LAYUP and missed a dozen great looks. And tonight they could have won had they simply made free throws and stopped with the iso play again. Their lack of effort and dominant ball stopping is pathetic to watch and has shot them in the foot for two losses already. They could easily be up 3-1 with some real effort.\n\nThe Thunder showed that what you have to do to beat the Warriors is make more than one pass each possession, attack the basket and play physical defense. They don't respond well to sustained physical play. When the Thunder stopped passing for multiple possessions and stopped attacking the basket and resorted to chucking, they lost the last three games. Cavs are doing the same thing. Instead of attacking the defense which proves to be the strength against the Warriors, they are settling for dribbling and chucking. Their mind/effort simply is not there. When you have LeBron/Kyrie or KD/Westbrook you can get into the lane at will and have the obvious advantage. But once they stop trying, and attempt to beat the Warriors at their own game (Off the dribble with the long ball) you lose every time. It's sad to watch really.||3
Right now it's making LeBron look like a fool btw they are playing. |Lakers|5
I agree for sure but LeBron also looks like a fool when he walks over Green and starts stuff when his team is down double digets with Curry doesn't seem to bother him much.||2
Coaches are hamstrung by Lebron. He won't allow more complicated offenses that don't include him in an ISO.|Celtics|22
Well I mean the best coaches he's ever had around are Boeheim and Krzyzewski. Can't really blame him. Back in 07 I was wondering how good he could be if he had a good head coach. Still wondering almost ten years later||-9
He's a coach killer that cycles through coaches like underwear with the sole exception of Spoelstra who he still didn't have a good relationship with. Hard to blame the coaches when he is the common denominator.|Celtics|1
Yeah but how many other good coaches has he had other than Spo, really? I honestly believe his best coaches since going Pro were from the Olympics with Boeheim and Krzyzewski. The guy has always been a team player and has incredible instinct/memory as noted by Spoelstra. Most people can't name a single coach in his past other than Spo and Blatt for a reason.||2
I kinda agree with him. I mean Jordan and Kobe got Phil. Wade got Pat. Duncan has Pop. Those were top coaches of all time. Spo, sure he maybe one of the best coaches now. But all time?||2
I think Spoelstra was pretty damn good.|[LAL] Kobe Bryant|12
I think Spo just had the chance of a lifetime dropped into his lap honestly. Not to say he's not a good coach, but I don't honestly think he's anywhere near great either. I'd pick a handful, maybe more, of current coaches ahead of him.||-5
Pop, carlise sure easy? Then who?|Heat|3
Lue? LOL||-1
Yeah those are definitely the easiest. I'd probably take Brad Stevens, Billy D, Kerr, Rivers, Vogel, and maybe Budenholzer. But that's just my opinion of course.||3
Def. Stevens though I am biased since I'm from Indiana\n\n(And just waiting for him to come back to coach in Bloomington after they finally can Crean's ass \xf0\x9f\x98\x81 )|Kings|1
I don't really think Lebron is the problem.\n\nKyrie ADMITS to getting lost on defense. I am sure he probably gets lost on offense and doesn't admit it. Love isn't very athletic to begin with. Shump is a defensive specialist, basically. I have no comment on J.R. Because he's really random.\n\nBasically, I don't think half the Cavs player can play in complicated offense, but Lebron definitely can. Lebron's really damn smart and has great court vision. And anyone who wants to argue just look at the Miami years.\n\nThe difference is Bosh, Wade, Allen, Battier are all smart players (and capable defenders).|Heat Bandwagon|7
At this point, we're not looking for a complicated offense... just one step up from the current iso or screen the ball to get a mismatch for a lebron iso. \n\nI distinctly remember several possessions in the second half last night where the Cavs were so close... they would set a ball screen, pass, set another screen, pass... and then LeBron would notice they got the switch they wanted, stand there, make 1-3 jab steps, and then drive. Why couldn't he just drive immediately? They had the ball moving, GS was moving and switching, and he just lets it all reset before continuing. \n\nThe biggest issue is Love can only play the 4 and is awful defending the PnR, while Bosh could play the 5 and was excellent at PnR defense. Like, look how impactful Tristan Thompson was last year and has been these past two games... now imagine he had a jumper. That was Bosh. |Cavaliers|4
? Heat played a really nice offense |Wizards|7
Spo's a better coach. Shame we didn't get  to see much of Blatt's play design. I remember break downs of his euro stuff was pretty.|Lakers|12
Yeah cavs need to get into offense much quicker. \n\nI'm not sure why LeBron uses screens just solely to get a mismatch. He can drive on any of GSW with out having a mismatch. And if he does get a mismatch why not get it while attacking the screen? \n\nWhy can't cavs get LeBron a post up anywhere close to the basket? Warriors post up Barnes and Thompson closer than Cavs post LBJ. ||17
> Why can't cavs get LeBron a post up anywhere close to the basket? Warriors post up Barnes and Thompson closer than Cavs post LBJ.\n\nLeBron doesn't want to. Just think, when LeBron plays primarily the 4, he's won 2 titles. \n|[CHI] Michael Jordan|1

Are you honestly fucking kidding me? Wtf are you taking about. Before tonight he was leading the series in points rebounds assists and minutes pergame. Yah just some haggard old man. You just hate on lebron because he has shat all over your team for the last decade||10
I'm not hating.....I got spect for dude, but he was far from the dominant driver we're all used to, and it cost him the game. By the way I'm talking about this game specifically|Bulls|2
He played 45 minutes or something tonight, of course he's tired.|Warriors|4
Idk, I'm not sure if I saw a single post up at all during game 4. \n\nI don't get how pro coaches are so bad at coaching and utilizing him and his size/strengths. ||7

fukken round mound of bitterness|Kings|4
Novice here, whats iso?||24
Isolation plays.||3
Yeah I thought it was something complicated, but then I watched kyrie and LeBron go solo for 12 minutes and I figured it out||3
Isolation. When a player calls for his teammates to space out the floor and allow his defender to take him 1 on 1 and basically just sit there and in this case just dribble.||28
Benefits of iso ball:\n\n* On rare occasions a player is good enough to steamroll an entire team for a game, maybe for two games. If they're truly great, they might win a few series this way (see LeBron's previous amazing series here and there, ie 25 pts in a row against Detroit https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1Px-jPm_TU). But rarely a series.\n* Ummm can't think of any others. Big star gets big stats? Some highlight reel material?\n\nDisadvantages of iso ball:\n\n* No team chemistry, no flow, weakened morale on the court\n* Fewer offensive rebounds\n* Opponents get to rest on defense\n* Opponents don't have to adjust or adapt or deal with surprises ||29
Also, and maybe this is an obvious pro/con, but it gives the other 8 players on the court a bit of a rest. \n\nIf an offense runs a ton of isos, it's less tiring over the course of the game (assuming the isos are spread out amongst players) as they don't have to expend energy setting or coming off screens, making cuts, etc. And of course, this also is less tiring for the defense, who won't have to spend energy fighting through screens/switching/chasing backdoor cuts. \n\nAnother pro of an iso play is that it lets you easily attack a player who is in foul trouble -- the Cavs actually did this to Klay Thompson last night late in the 2nd quarter (Klay had 2 fouls). |Cavaliers|6
one more potential pro: it slows the game waaay down and limits fast break opportunities for the opposing team (e.g. last year's finals)|Warriors|7
Less turnovers as well|Thunder|8
So the advantage of isolation plays is when you think you have a mismatch.  If you think your guy can take their guy every single time, it makes sense to run an isolation play.  Typically LeBron is a good bet to win these matchups, so it makes some sense.  |Warriors|16
Except if the other team sees that's all you do it's easy to play help defense since a lot times they are unlikely to pass (***looking at Irving, PG w 28 shots vs 4 assists)|[LAL] Kobe Bryant|11

Lebron James and the Buffalo Bills are the greatest dynasties ever in Africa|Lakers|9
What's the reference? I'm rather new.|Warriors|12
Professional sports usually print enough t shirts for both teams competing in the championship game/series, which explains why the SECOND a team wins a Super Bowl, the NBA Finals, or the World Series etc., the winning team is all wearing hats and shirts that says the year and "world champions" or something.  \n  \nI\'ll give you one guess as to what happens to the shirts made for the teams that obviously don\'t get championship t shirts each year. |Warriors|7
Since nobody knows who is gonna win the play offs finals both teams camps manufacturers the winning t-shirts, hoodies and accessories which is intended to be worn after and during the last game of the play offs finals so that they can show support and celebrate.\n\nThe losing teams clothing gets sent out to africa and other third world countries  and since Lebron James has been in 7 finals and only won 2 (so far) the kids in africa who recieves the clothes will think that he keeps winning them.||44
Africa isn't a country.||-1
But if they know the losing teams jerseys will get sent to Africa wouldnt they know that lebron has lost so many finals?|Timberwolves|2
Basketball is not that big in majority of African countries (very soccer friendly) \nSo they likely don't follow the sport but just buy the clothing which often says that the losing team has won. ||3

So I guess in the finals of big sports (NFL, NBA, etc.) they make Champions shirts for each team so that the players of the winning team can quickly put em on right after the game ends, and the shirts of the team that didn't win supposedly get sent to Africa/other 3rd world countries as donations |Celtics|10

wait is this real?|Lakers|14
https://twitter.com/ChatSports/status/741443546247516160|Lakers|8
I can't believe he just disappeared off the map. I honestly hope he saved most of his money. He really doesn't owe us or the league anything in my opinion. Would be pretty cool if he has enough money to just chill the rest of his life. He was extremely lucky with this career but he achieved a lot either way.|Thunder|24
It sounded like from just whispers around the league, from people that knew him, that Bynum never really loved the game. Sounds like it was just one of those things, people saw the type of body he was growing up into as a kid, told him he should play basketball, so he did and found success, but he never really had a passion for it himself. But hey, are you gonna turn down a bright future and potentially tons of money in the future? Probably not. But seems like once he got it, after a while, that lack of passion was just too strong.|Suns|17
It's weird people say he didn't enjoy the game. He was legit skilled, he worked on that shit clearly. Meanwhile you got a league of unskilled centers out here|Warriors|1
You don't have to enjoy something to be really good at it. I hate what I study, but I end up with amazing grades at the end of each term anyway. Sometimes the sense of duty is enough to drive you to succeed. Those who have both that and a passion for it are just very lucky.|Magic|3
I mean he struggled with his knees like his whole life as well. Having the first of many knee surgeries at like 12 years old and continuing to battle with that would suck. Combine that with possibly not loving the game that much and quitting after a couple rings and like 70 mil would probs be pretty appealing.|Lakers|12
He was arguably the best center in the league at one point! I mean look at this [footwork and the moves!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPhM1Y8EUdw)|Lakers|25
Surely there is more to the story with him than we know|Thunder|5
Haven't seen anyone really comment on it, but those minutes when Varejao played were great. He played with a great sense of urgency |Lakers|486
he fucking sucks he's a flopping stick ||-6
Totally! It was refreshing to see AV bring that energy. |Warriors Bandwagon|1
Very odd +/- of zero||1
I just wish he didn't flop everytime a finger touches him so I could like him||4
He outplayed Kevin FUCKING Love, this shit is hilarious and atrocious for the Cavs front office|Wizards|2
I get nervous watching him play.  It feels like he's going to either fall apart or injure someone at any given moment.  He's like a human bowling ball, he just can't stop his momentum.||2
YES! Varejao was a beast on the boards getting crazy offesnive rebounds!||3
Honestly his minutes in the 3rd felt like the turning point of the game to me. The Dubs had been playing from behind, and personally I didn't really get the sense that they were confident. Usually when watching the Warriors, no lead really feels safe, but the Cavs lead felt safe to me. Then Varejao came in there and really seemed to spark them. He played like he wanted that ring. No way he wants to see Cleveland finally win a ring the same year they cut him after 12 years, AND have it be won against his current team. I'd be balling my ass off too in that situation.||16
He good guy mang.||10
For someone who gets a ring either way, he played his heart out today. |Warriors|207
He's not guaranteed a ring if Cleveland wins, the team decides if they want to get one for him. Though he won't have to worry about that.||1
> Though he won't have to worry about that.\n\n\nWell well well...|NBA|1
if the cavs won, the players would vote as to weather or not he would get a ring.||1
Sorry for the noob question, but how does he get a ring either way? Or is it just a joke? I do get that there is a circlejerk around Varejao here, but I still don't get what his deal is. Please bring me some clarity man.||4
Fellow noob here. I had the same question but reading some of the comments looks like he was traded to golden state mid-season. So he played a good chunk of the season at Cleveland which allows the team to give him a ring if they would like to. \n\nSomeone correct me if I'm wrong please! |Wizards|5
You're not wrong. That pretty much sums it up! |Spurs|4
So if the Cavs won, they could say "Hey Varejao, we liked you when you were in our organization, here\'s your ring". Or they could say "Fuck you Varejao, you won\'t get anything". Both scenarios are possible?||3
Yes but the likelihood that the cavs would do that is basically zero. Even if you discount the years of service he gave them. Most teams give out rings to all the players that are eligible. |Bulls|3
Ah I see, thanks for clarifying||1
Thought you had to be on the teams playoff roster to get a ring?|[MIN] Kevin Garnett|4
Just have to play something like 32-35 games/ be on the roster for that amount of games a season iirc||2
He knows the Warriors rings will be massive compared to a Cavs ring|Warriors|30
Honestly though. I can't imagine he would view the Cavs ring with any sense of pride at all. To me personally it wouldn't have much value at all. Not even a fraction that it would have if I actually won. |Celtics|18
i actually think he'd value the cavs ring more, since he spent most of his career there and clearly loves the team.\n\nhe's been with the warriors 5 minutes and other then a few moments tonight hasn't really contributed much at all besides flopping.|Supersonics|-22
When you\'re in the finals playing against the team that traded you, you don\'t want the biggest trophy of your career to be "lol remember when you got beat by the team that didn\'t want you anymore?" Everyone would rather win a ring by actually contributing to that team.|[PHI] Kyle Korver|21
I could see him auctioning it off for charity a la Darko with the Pistons.|Pistons|2
Who wouldn't want to beat the team that felt you weren't worth keeping|Lakers|318
While the sentiment is understandable, even Varejao couldn't argue he was worth keeping with a straight face. The Warriors signed him for some Cleveland insider stories and for 6 finals fouls a game if needed.||16
He's also got a pretty good basketball iq, exactly the type of guy the warriors like for their bench|Warriors|8
He's a hustle player. He may not be flashy or score a lot but he draws fouls. Takes fouls, Disrupts opponents, rebounds and fights for loose balls.||3
And the home crowd boo'd you the last game |Kings|21
did they really?  wtf?  how can you not like him, he seems like one of the more chill / likable players|Celtics|3
he's a flopper. but he flopped for them so many times, it's only fair that he gets to do it on his new team. |[BOS] Avery Bradley|5
He played 12!?!?!?! years for Cavs and they traded him to save money, he was pissed and now they are booing him. I just cant believe how dumb some fans can be.|Nets|76
well they sure as hell aren't gonna be cheering for him|Lakers|2
Everyone I know was upset about the trade. Then when he got on the warriors everyone was upset about him. Calling it a betrayel and shit. We traded him. He took his best option. People are so fucking dumb.||9
Cleveland in accounting don't give a fuck.|Warriors|12
Idk what it is about Steph, but it seems like he pisses LeBron off way more than any other superstar in the league. LeBron is known for being buddy buddy with a lot of the league, but for some reason Steph really seems to irk him.|Lakers|1165
>TFW while you can try again next year, you will never get younger and you can feel the inescapable, nagging existential fear that you have already peaked, your prime is in the past, and from here on out the younger guys will always outball you, is setting in.||2
Steph is also from Akron Ohio and made a comment a year ago about wanting to have a championship parade their before lebron did or someshit. |Raptors|5
LeBron tweeted one time:\n\n@StephenCurry30\xc2\xa0needs to stop it man!! He's ridiculous man! Never before seen someone like him in the history of ball!|Raptors|5
I think it\'s about Steph stealing his spot light. Taking consecutive MVP\'s. Everyone saying Steph is the best. Even after a Finals game where he scored 2 points in the half, he\'s still "better" than LeBron.|Raptors|9
Steph doesn't go to clubs, curse,very regilious and seems to be a doting husband. He's really a dweeb probably in lebrons eyes.|Heat|11

If Curry is tiny, then LeBron must REALLY hate me...|Warriors Bandwagon|2
I noticed this as well! Curry took Lebron's crown, right when Lebron was poised to make his redemption tour. ||12
Well I think part of the problem is lebrons grasp on the crown has always been tenuous as fuck.\n\nFirst he comes in the league as king James.\n\nHe develops a bit but jumps on the scene in 07 poised to be a finals mainstay for years to come.\n\nBut that gets interrupted by his team sucking and Kobe reclaiming he top spot.\n\nThen as Kobe finally fades and lebron is back in the finals everyone is washing it off as wades team, needing help, taking my talents to victory parades.\n\nThen lebrons ready to correct all that by winning it for the land and here comes steph and were ready to not only bash lebron the player, but now also lebron the GM/coach.\n\nSo I don\'t think it\'s anything particular about steph as much as culmination of a decade of "what do I have to do?!?!"|Lakers|18
It's because he knows that curry dethroned him. and he's salty as fuck|Mavericks|176
About that....|NBA|3

Steph is the darling of the media now, and his team isn't going to let Lebron win another ring - at least not with this iteration of this team.  Lebron is probably just having a hard time coming to grips with fate|Lakers|33
Because no other star in the league has been a threat to his global icon status like this before.  Steph is taking his MVP's, Steph is taking his titles, Steph can do no wrong with the media.  Besides the ghosts that Lebron is chasing, Steph is the first star that is actually rivaling him on the court and taking his spotlight.||69
I'd be mad too. Steph is awesome but what kind of MVP isn't even on the third nba all defensive team? As a Kobe fan I'm comfortable saying lebron is the best in  the league right now. Warriors are a better team though|[LAL] Mark Madsen|-5
Here we go again overrating defense...|Celtics|1
its only half of the game. i guess youre right...\n|[LAL] Mark Madsen|1
Tony Allen or James Harden?|Celtics|1
good point, but its not always one or the other. guys like kobe, jordan, lebron, duncan, kg etc could have possibly been hall of fame players without scoring a bucket. \n|[LAL] Mark Madsen|1
Also, like it or not, steph curry actually looks like a human being, whereas lebron does not.||21
what does that even mean?|Cavaliers|9
I don't know but it's provocative|Raptors|2
Steph curry looks like a normal human being. Lebron does not. Steph is a relatively normal height, normal build. If you saw steph walking down the street you probably wouldn't make note of him(unless you knew it was steph curry). Lebron is not only extremely tall, but is just a massive person. No way you don't notice him.||5
He's a skinny kid, LeBron is a beast. Easier to relate to.\n\n||14
It's like the Messi vs Ronaldo debate. Messi is more relatable because he is a 5 foot 7 average looking dude where Ronaldo looks like a Greek god.|76ers Bandwagon|17

Fuck and Golden State. We all saw what happened. LeBron James is the best is the player in the world and has been for 6 years at least.||1
Damn it's still crazy to me that Curry is older than D.Rose, Westbrook, AND Durant!|East|1

So.... Messi and Cristiano of NBA then||5
I remember hating  nash and the suns back in 06 07 when he stole two mvps and beat the lakers in round one. It wasn't rational to hate him but I just hated the three pointers they'd make and the system they had. That system is similar to the warriors so I understand the hate. I personally never liked the three  ball being your bread and butter but I gotta get over that|[LAL] Mark Madsen|4
The 3 ball is pretty yag, but I have to accept it|Warriors|1
?|[WAS] John Wall|4
Also the fact that Curry just doesn't care about any adversity. He isn't phased and doesn't let the emotions of the game take over. Kobe said it best in that he really plays in the moment.|Raptors Bandwagon|12
Is that right?||5
whos dancing now lol|Lakers|7
Queen mother LeBron. ||5
Oh for sure man|Bucks|8
Smaller, younger, less athletic, better looking, better friends with Drake, the list goes on|Bulls|7
Did you just describe Joffrey|Timberwolves|10
Just like many of of the old retired stars like Barkley, these guys are watching the NBA transform into a different style of play in front of their very eyes and the new face of the league is so different than the guys they grew up worshipping.... guys who could fly above the rim or dominate the paint. They don't know how to react. So they're pissed.||86
preach|Lakers|4
This is a REALLY good way to describe it |Rockets|476
No it isnt|Heat|-31
You were right and they were wrong||1
You're right Lebron sill has his crown as evidenced by him winning mvp the last two years and winning both finals.||32
My comment was just as valid as the one I replied to. I'm not sure what your comment proves other than you've been paying attention for 2 years?\nHe didn't win a ring 3 years ago vs the Spurs the 2nd time around either|Heat|-29
So Duncan's the king?|Mavericks|12
Duhhhh|Warriors Bandwagon|3
Can robots be king?|Spurs|6
And has outplayed Curry on both occasions. In case you somehow forgot: basketball is a TEAM sport. It's not tennis for crying out loud.|Kyrie Irving|-27
Yep. Lebron is clearly the king. Mvp two years in a row.||10
And if curry is the king, where are his finals MVPs?|Rockets|-4
Might get it this year, but so far looks like green or iggy again.||0
For sure it could still happen this year, he played great last night\n\n\nBut lebron was finals MVP on both his rings, Kobe got criticized until he won his own finals MVPs, and Jordan was 6 for 6.\n\nThat's just what the greats do. Not to take anything away from curry though, he's still got time but he hasn't reached that level yet|Rockets|0
He doesn't need to be the finals mvp if his team ends up with the ring. It's a team game, and the Warriors are dominating. |Warriors|1
> It's a team game, and the Warriors are dominating.\n\nThanks. That was a complicated one\n\n\ntoo bad we aren't talking about the finals in general and are talking about  who is the best player in the league|Rockets|1
I don't feel the need to legitimize LeBron or diminish Curry's great season. \n\nBut this is the first non-embarrassing game Curry has had in the most important series of the season and yet he's hailed as the herald yet again without even a hint of anything else. He's not even the best player on his own team during the Finals. Twice I might add. |Kyrie Irving|-18
Lebron averaging 7 turnovers a game isn't embarrassing or scoring 3 points in a first half on your home turf in a must win game? Just wondering||2
The only embarrassing game was game three. The Cavs organization is more of an embarrassment than currys finals. Highest paid roster and most luxury tax paid.... and they're mediocre. Remeber the browns did the same thing a couple years ago, highest paid defense was in the bottom five at the end of the season.||2
Game 2 he had 18 points on 7/11 4/8 3P and 9 rebounds in 24 mins.... That's embarrassing?||28
I think he'll settle for finals MVP.. Unanimously at that|Cavaliers|2
Nah, but this Finals ||1
No it isn't? Except for this game he outplayed Curry every step along the way, in this years Finals and last years. In the playoffs as a whole Curry has been bailed out by his team so many times it's not even funny anymore. Curry really is criticism-proof, he has some of the most blind/uninformed fans in the history of the NBA. At least even the Kobe-fans made excuses. Curry-fans treat him like some kind of golden God who can do no wrong.\n\nAnd now you'll bombard me by taking away my imaginary internet points. See if I care.|Kyrie Irving|-103
How did LeBron outplay Curry this game? |Spurs Bandwagon|8
> Except for this game\n\n|Kyrie Irving|7
Dropped 38 on their ass though. |[LAL] Metta World Peace|3
Wasn't everybody shitting on Curry before OKC choked? |Timberwolves|5
Yup|Pacers|2
Sorry the NBA is a team game?  And Sorry people like Curry more?  People know James is good,  they just like watching Curry shoot, stop being offended. |Suns|32
And handle the ball. People always underrate his ball handling skills. Sometimes it feels like he\'s got it on a string. But to go back to the above dudes tirade, I think Steph has more fans because the guy just seems more relatable and likable. LeBron always wanted to be liked and it came off as a weird sort of political pandering. People like Steph because he wasn\'t crowned the day he showed up. He worked from the shadows for awhile, got better better before our eyes but always stayed the same dude it seemed. LeBron tried to have it all. He wanted to leave Cleveland and not be hated. That\'s how you get shit like "The Decision" and then jerseys burning in the streets. I had more to include, but now I can\'t remember and I\'m tired...|Warriors Bandwagon|26
Also in pretty sure that this season he had the best offensive season statistically by a single player ever. ||4
I thoroughly enjoy watching Lebrons signature drive to the basket while arm barring for a layup/dunk. It's so thrilling! /s |Spurs|37
I enjoy his signature flops and complaining to the Refs myself while arguing with Curry when your losing the finals playing passive as hell yet again||3

This Warriors team and Steph is the first time LeBron hasn't been the driving narrative in the NBA since he became the best player. Its the first time his face of the league status has been legitimately threatened. I think a lot of superstars around the league feel threatened or tired of Curry being the golden boy and becoming a sports phenomenon.|Timberwolves|341
I don't think Lebron has been the driving narrative in the NBA except for his villain turns. If you ask anyone who doesn't follow the NBA about LeBron chances are all they'll know about is him being good and the decision. If anything he should be glad Draymond Green came along and took away his most hated man in ball title. ||7
> If anything he should be glad Draymond Green came along and took away his most hated man in ball title. \n\nI was thinking the same. Green is a moron.||-20
Why do people hate Draymond? |Wizards|3
Because he's really, really good.|Raptors|6
Also he seems to be allowed to nut shot guys with impunity. ||31
So they are jealous|Warriors|-2
Because he likes to karate people in the balls |[GSW] Baron Davis|33
I don't know if it's as personal as that. Couldn't it just be Lebron wants to win, and the Warriors making his team look like chumps is frustrating to him?||29
Especially being a shooter. Golden state is changing the way NBA ball is played. ||16
Light years ahead.|Pistons|1
Tristan Thompson on the bench in the clutch that was Lue's basketball crime|Celtics|1608
Lue is gone. |Lakers|1
Seriously, he was playing great defensively and offensively, I don't get it|Spurs|1
*still assuming Lebron's not running the show |Knicks|1
I think the 11 missed free throws should be mentioned way before this.|Mavericks|1
The warriors win was fueled by andy vs love|Nets|1
Just like OKC with Adams last series. |Timberwolves|1
Dude bricked every FT, was a huge liability.  Fucking one way 80 mil player.|Lakers|2
prematurely guarding against hack-a? would be a shit reason, but maybe what he was thinking?|Bulls|2
you're telling me love cant protect the rim. what!!!!!!!!!|Lakers|2
Seriously.  It seemed like he didn't touch the floor in the second half after dominating in the first |Celtics|3
5 boards in his first 8 minutes; 2 in the next 20. ||3
His team standing still for the last 10 minutes while Lebron tried to 1v5 the Warriors on every possession was a bigger crime. |Warriors|3
I have absolutely no idea what that lineup was at the end...|NBA|3
Love was so bad. He should've been benched |Hornets|4
Yeah. Even earlier when Varajao got all those tip outs and boards TT wasn't in.|Heat|5
People said this sub overreacted after game 2 but now we see why it wasn't. A rookie coach has very low chances of beating an all-time great team at oracle two times in a row.|[OKC] Steven Adams|25
And Kerr is a great coach, he's extremely intelligent with his rotations and putting in key players at the right moment.|Bulls|4
I don't know how many games it will take Cleveland to beat the Warriors 3 times but it sure as shit isn't 3. |Warriors|12
"Offensive rebounds? Pfft don\'t need em"|Thunder Bandwagon|34
Except the guy couldnt hit a free throw to save his life this game. |Warriors Bandwagon|52
Gives me the good old hack a shack flashbacks to the early 2000's god bless||2
He was a free throw liability ||95
Regardless, the fouls used to hack him can haunt GSW in the late game. TT should have played.||4
What was he 0-5?||4
yep.|Celtics|1
Some people don't want to admit GS is just better. Lue has no options.|Supersonics|32
The issue with the Cav bench is that for everything they do well, there is something they do horribly.  You have to pick and choose which liability you are willing to live with at that time.  GS doesn't have that much of a problem.  And depending on certain lineups their opponents put on the floor, their Bench matchups might be even *better* than their first 5.|Magic|13
Completely destroyed their rebounding advantage|[CHA] Kemba Walker|539
As soon as he went off the warriors started grabbing those rebounds in.|Warriors|1
Same when OKC took out Adams in crunch time in game 7. Teams think they *have to* match up with GSW and go small, but forget the advantages of having a big in there.|Bulls|3
Fuck these new coaches. The reason why CLE was able to challenge GSW last year was because of their big lineup. Oh wait, Blatt was their coach last year. And that, ladies and gentlemen, is the difference of an experienced coach vs. a new one.||2
Thompson was balling so fucking hard. It's a travesty he was off of the floor for so long.|Celtics|464
Thompson is so much more valuable then love. They definitely should have kept Wiggins in my opinion ||1
He anticipated hack a Thompson. Not sure if I disagree. ||1
I mean so much of their only offense they could get was Bron or Irving driving, and if they didn't throw it at the hoop, they'd drop it off to the big. TT couldn't hit his free throws. |76ers|2
[deleted]||2
okay, Stephen A, lol|Celtics|1
As a Warrior fan, I am literally fearing TT more than Lebron this series.|[GSW] Chris Mullin|6
I think kerr would have started hacking him, but still. Shouldve been out there||210
Kerr's giving up 8 inches to him. TT could just shoot over him.   \n\nSorry, I'll show myself out. |Lakers|1
doesn't work in the final 2 minutes though. |[NBA] LeBron James|4
I meant before that. He sat for a while ||7
Even then, he hadn't started hackin. So keep blasting those boards until the hackin starts?|Celtics|5
Yep. He was something like 0/5 from the line if I remember right. |[GSW] Shaun Livingston|124
law of averages tho, he would've been guaranteed to hit his next 6 ^^/s|Warriors|2
yeah but if TT gives you an extra possession for every free throw he takes, his value is still positive. leave him in.|[NYK] Amar'e Stoudemire|3
Yea..... gotta at least make 50% come on TT||10
I guess Lue wanted more 3s from Frye. Too bad they were 1-9 in the second half.|Hornets|371
Hahaha. Like LeBron isn't just calling all the shots ||1
People said Fry's going to light it up. |Warriors Bandwagon|1
Weight Channing Frye played in that game?|Warriors|1
And didn't even attempt a 3 when they started intentionally fouling|Lakers|2
That's a good idea in theory but he was invisible on offense.  All I ever saw him do was get beat like a thousand times by Curry. |Celtics|2
Frye didn't even try to shoot threes lol|Pacers|2
I don't think I've ever seen anyone get so systematically rocked like Frye did defensively. There was a seemingly extraordinary amount of open 3's for the Splash Brothers tonight, most of which were Frye overcommitting/not switching. |Warriors|3
Too bad that means Lue wanted to try beat the Warriors with 3s......WAT|Celtics|5
He didn't shoot whole game, so why he even expected points from Frye? TT was on fire and when camera shown his face at the end of game  I saw his dissapointment|Celtics|38
Dude blew assignment after assignment, wtf was he doing on the floor in crunch time |Heat|384
I still have Channing Frye nightmares. Probably trying to recapture some of that magic.|[TOR] Jerome Williams|2
Yeah, and Thompson was playing good defence too. I was impressed as hell when he guarded Curry on that one possession. Played it perfectly.|Raptors|2
There's a reason the Suns declined to re-sign him at that price - he's a very streaky shooter and his defense and rebounding is just plain bad.\n\nPeople laughed and acted like we didn't know what we were giving up but anyone who watched the Suns enough knew already - he's a turnstile.|Suns|7
I know, everyone has been talking about Love's defense, but damn Frye's was bad. He seemed to have no idea what the defensive gameplan was.|[GSW] Chris Mullin|63
Frye is old; hes slow. Lye should know he cant be expected to be nimble on D||1
Frye makes Love look like Bill Russell defensively|[NYK] J.R. Smith|8
I guess he was there to shoot 3's except Lue forgot he had to actually draw up a play for that to happen|Trail Blazers|243
Yup....|[CLE] LeBron James|1
I guess Tim Beck was running the offense in the second half.|Cavaliers|3
It was like a kid playing NBA 2K. Spends most of clock trying to force into the paint with LeBron and if that doesn't work outlet pass to chuck contested 3. They almost always pick Cavaliers too.|Hawks|22

This is the most ignorant comment I\'ve seen in my life. JR Smith is not the Cavs 2nd best player. I understand you\'re trying to make a joke but at least try to be accurate? Kyrie is the 2nd best player on the Cavs and it makes the "joke" make no sense bc Kyrie and Wade are both stars in this league. |[CLE] Kyrie Irving|2
Both stars? I agree, but Kyrie is a promising player who still has a lot to learn whereas Wade with Lebron was a battle-tested former NBA champion who had already been to the highest level and won. He was in the absolute prime of his career. Kyrie right now is a clear step down from where Wade was with those Lebron Heat teams. |Warriors|-2
Kyrie just posted back-to-back 30 point games against one of the best teams of all time. Promising player? Yes. Clear step down? No. He might not be as good as Wade was but he's a top 5 PG in this league with room to grow.|[CLE] Kyrie Irving|2
Hi, I'm Lebron's 2016 supporting cast, and I have a ring.|Cavaliers|2
And I'm Lebron's 2007 supporting cast and I haveBAHAHAHAHAHAHA|[BOS] Rajon Rondo|5
This is exactly why I think it's ludicrous to condemn Lebron for being 2 of 6(and soon to be 7) in the finals. His team just wasn't as good as the other team. Basketball is a team sport and one guy can't do everything. Especially when he doesn't have much of a pull up J|Trail Blazers|-1
downvoted for speaking the truth lol |Lakers|3
Lebron dragged big Z and Larry Hughes only to get pummeled but dragging that ass team to the finals was a miracle|Celtics|3
Okay let's be honest that's not a fair comparison. DWade was the Kyrie of that team. JR Smith is maybe a Chalmers or Allen||4
You putting Ray Allen and JR Smith in the same category? That's Jesus Shuttlesworth man! Show some respect. Maybe JR is Rio though...|Heat|4
:(|[BOS] Ray Allen|1
So have we come full circle now and we're back to Lebron doesn't have anyone around him? Am I taking crazy pills? ||3
No, you're in a post game thread. The state of this sub is such that you must wait for the Next Day Thread for any insights worth discussing.|NBA|1
His Dwayne wade is Kyrie, not JR. JR is like the Mario chalmers of this team. |Rockets|4
Kyrie is a top scoring talent in the entire NBA. Kevin Love has averaged 26 and 15. Shumpert is a great perimiter defender and athlete. JR Smith is one of the best 3P shooters in the NBA. Tristan Thomspon is one of the best rebounders in the NBA. Oh and obviously Lebron.\n\nStill not good enough I guess. How much better can his supporting cast get?\n\nThe blame doesn't go on the supporting cast it goes on the team as a whole, their coaching, and their play style. They lost because they played awful defense and lazy offense. Several times they got completely lost on routine switches, leaving Klay and Steph wide open for 3's. And offensively down the stretch they played hero ball instead of passing and motion. |Generals|5
He's had two bad finals games. Stop giving him excuses.|Lakers|7
I mean, I don't consider Lebron to be in the god tier with Jordan and Shaq (my pick for #2 player I've seen in my lifetime). I've never felt that way about him. You could see in the Heat/Mavs series that he didn't quite have the killer instinct to be the alpha dog in every moment. I honestly think of him as being a pass-first point guard trapped in the most athletic body in NBA history. He seems like a guy who was forced into a scoring role because he was just so athletically gifted, but who maybe didn't have the natural scorer's mindset. I think he works best when he has that type of player (Wade) alongside him. That being said, you're fooling yourself if you don't think the Warriors 2-12 are better than Cleveland's 2-12. It's not even close IMO. |Warriors|2
Oh and Kevin Love and Kyrie Irving--who 538 and everyone else--said was a championship triumvirate. No rewriting history now...|Supersonics|9
They were a championship caliber trio, then the Warriors got really, really good. The Cavs were the favorites going into the 2014 season, but by the end of the calendar year the Warriors were the favorites for the title.|Timberwolves|0
I would hate to coach or play with Lebron. Sure he's one of the greatest but if you win, he gets all the credit and if you lose, you get all the blame. Hell even if you do win, he just gets the credit for carrying your ass. |[LAL] Mike Penberthy|30
I mean 4 days ago this sub was up in arms because LeBron's team that HE created was getting blown out. He was getting a lot of flak then|[HOU] Tracy McGrady|4

I agree. It kind of takes away from Lebron if he needs Wade to win. This Cavs team has a good supporting cast.|Celtics|23
And some of them aren't performing up to par. How does that take away from LeBron??|[SAC] Rudy Gay|0
Neither is LeBron.||-1
This warriors team would beat that bulls team. They are the best I've ever seen. I'm old. I've never seen ball movement as good (Spurs was but) with that kind of three point shooting.  There is no answer. They broke the game. Spurs would get a lot of movement and get something going to the basket but these guys have so much spacing and then the ability to hit the three. \n\nDid you know, if you hit 33% of your three point shots that it's the equivalent to hitting 50% of your two point shots? \n\n2/6 from three = 6 points\n3/6 from two = 6 points. \n\nIf a team is going to shoot BETTER than 33% from three, and you shoot 50% for the game, you'll still lose (barring turnovers). The dubs have won the nba. The Bulls could never have hit threes with that efficiency. (Sorry Steve, not sorry Steve)|Raptors|0
That's hilarious. The Bulls would sweep this team. MJ would wipe his ass with Steph Curry.||-1
Yeah, MJ would, that's why iggy would guard him. \n\nI saw Jordan win those titles. He was t that different from Lebron or magic in his ability to take over and assert his will on the game. But they would get demolished by the spacing and 3pt shooting. |Raptors|-1
Jordan would destroy Iggy. I saw him play too, and Golden State wouldn't stand a chance. Jordan would guard Curry and still get 45 against Igoudala. Alternatively you can double Jordan, he will still get 25 and own Pippen will score 35. Pippen could easily shut down Klay. Draymond would not be able to scrap with Rodman. Who is going to guard Kukoc? Who's guarding Kerr? |Lakers|1
Wade doesn't need LeBron to win either.|Mavericks|1
Nah man, you don't see it do you?\n\n\n. \n \n. \n\n. \n\n. \n\n. \n\n\n\nHe needs Chalmers. |[IND] Paul George|16
Nope just D-AIDS |[DAL] Jason Terry|3
I mean 34 points on 50% shooting isn't exactly garbage level...|Lakers|14
But his defense isn't even remotely close to Wade. Same for Bosh vs Love. |[IND] Paul George|11
That gonna be the excuse this year? I swear man watch Lebron lose the finals next year again with Miami and Lebron fanboys will say "well d-wade is too old now"|Warriors|10
2013 LeBron with this supporting cast would still not beat the 2015-16 Warriors in a Finals series.|NBA|2
No, the Cavs don't need an excuse, they are losing to a better team, one of the 3/4 best teams of all-time. |Celtics|3
Kyries kinda like james harden without the passing|[GSW] Draymond Green|27
I also think Hardens a much better scorer.|Rockets|23
Agreed |[GSW] Draymond Green|3
I'm not sure I'd say much better.  Harden is much better at getting to the line but when the ref's swallow the whistle especially in the playoffs it's tough to really say.  Irving makes a lot of shots that make you wonder how the hell he managed to get the shot off let alone make it.|Raptors|4
Amazing, kyrie pretty much outplayed him today, and this will be the narrative|West|257
It always is. |[LAL] Julius Randle|2
Offensively, yes. But Kyrie still doesn't play defense. |76ers|5
kyrie scored more, he didn't outplay bron. kyrie had his own harden-esque montage of blown assignments after a commercial break.|[HOU] Moochie Norris|15
Kyrie had some great defensive stops but he was an overall negative\n\nHowever, I'm of the opinion that lebrons constant lane jumping for steals is a detriment, especially when the Warriors aren't turning it over like retards, as in game 3|West|8
Excuses again. TT and Kyrie balled tonight.|[DAL] Dirk Nowitzki|36
I think Kyrie scored 2 points in the 4th quarter. His potential is obvious and he has a world of talent, but he's not the finished product yet. |Warriors|6
He is still a very good player. To imply Lebron doesn't have a supporting cast is deeply misguided.|Celtics|13
LeBron is immune from criticism in the media and on here at this point. Any legitimate criticisms of him this series will be dismissed by saying "he has no help". He chose this team, he helped build this team, the loss in this series will be completely on him.|Heat|2
They aren't deeper than Golden State, maybe every other team but not Golden State so it's not fair for them.  /s|Suns|6
And that's when LeBron should have taken over. Teams look to their leader to get them to the finish line. The supporting cast did their job for the first 3 quarters and kept the game close while LeBron was being extremely passive when he had key opportunities to score. This was a let-down game from LeBron. |Cavaliers|18

HAHAHHHAAHAHAH|[MIA] Dwyane Wade|5
Yeah, I earned that. Still that series comeback would've been tough to predict, but that's why Lebron is Lebron. For casual fans and mild homers it **will** change the discussion on Lebron James. ||1
damn. eat up son.|76ers|3
Surprised to see a historic 3-1 resurrection. All hail the King. ||2
Hey dude, I shitposted a tonne of your comments before I saw this one, my bad. |[MIA] Dwyane Wade|1
Edit: TL;DR, yeah I probably was looking through some (hopefully lightly) homer colored glasses, but a 3-1 comeback in that fashion will help solidify Lebron in that top-end conversation amongst even mild homers and casual fans, and those people are precisely who would be trash I g James if he didn\'t bring a ring to Cleveland. \n\nNo problem man. Shitposting is Reddit\'s new favorite past-time. \n\nAnd while 3-1 was a historic deficit that will only further to strengthen Lebron\'s legacy, I stand by my statement: if he *didn\'t* get Cleveland a title I think the public perceptions of Lebron would take a heavy hit. Of course, it\'s moot now; he won and he won in a very Kingly fashion. \n\nMoreover, I definitely meant the general public. The kind of people that watch Sportscenter or First Take in lieu of actual games. Real basketball enthusiasts (the kind that love the love the game so much they\'ll come shitpost in /r/NBA) have never (or at least almost never) doubted that Lebron would and has taken a bite out of NBA history. For those of use that don\'t think a "pick and roll" is a booger elimination technique the question has only been "How big of a bite will he end up with?"\n\nAs a Laker fan (though born in TX, live in GA, my paternal side is SoCal, and my first live sporting event was floor seats at the Lakers) I wish "Greatest" was a two-horse race between MJ and Kobe, but I think if I\'m going to put Kobe in there, now I gotta out Lebron in there too. (I know I\'m being a minor homer here, there may be no "Jordan Level," there may just be Jordan, and every one is fighting for \n\nI think this championship for CLE has really helped him against the general public and the minor homers (the major homers already are lost causes; you know the type: "Jordan? Sheeseeeit, if T-Mac hadn\'t injured his knees he\'d have all them records!"... "He wasn\'t consistent, sure but when \'the Hibachi\' heated up, man he coulda taken Kobe, MJ, and the Ghost of Larry Bird at the same time, mm hmm!"||2

because once golden shite werriors start shooting bricks, they lost. And he's right to have faith on bron after today ||6

I don't think Cleveland is an awesome town but it's not nearly as bad as people make it out to be. I think his point was about the man being bitter because of so many years of Cleveland chokes. \n\nEDIT: Not usually chokes in the Cavs case, but a lot of losing to superior teams in the finals.|[CHA] Jeremy Lin|1
People make fun of Cleveland, and I think that's what the person I was responding to was doing. But I used to tour in a punk rock band, and I've played shows all over the place. Cleveland is a special town. I loved hanging out there, and the crowd there was always amazing. We would actually drive up from Atlanta to Cleveland to start and end our tours there. I'm not kidding. It's a rad friggin town. Ohio in general is pretty cool when you ignore the retarded politics. And Cleveland is by far the best spot.|Heat|3

For real. I want a gif of him walking out halfway through the fourth. I really find it hard to belive fans ever thought the Cavs had any chance at all.||3

Windhorst (kind of) threw some shade at Curry's performance during today's practice saying he was *terrible* & that everything was just off.|[LAL] Luke Walton|6
As Windhorst comes home to a microwaved 4th meal and slams down some Cheetos. *Windhorst sighs* |Cavaliers|11
What did Windhorst say?\n|Vancouver Grizzlies|1
Windhorst said he saw Curry practice & that he just looked terrible throughout that instance and also stated that everything just looked off about him. ([Link](http://espn.go.com/video/clip?id=espn:16101819))|Lakers|6
so far Livingston has one win, Draymond has one win, and Steph has one win. It will be interesting to see who wins it for us on Monday to claim series MVP.|Warriors|2
LOLOLOL|[MIA] Dwyane Wade|1
I mean even in the game Livingston went off, Draymond was the best defensive player on the floor (40 minutes played) while being 3ast away from a triple double (16pts, 11reb, 7ast).\n\nLivingston really was amazing in that game though so yeah, he brought the momentum & was efficient as hell.|[LAL] Luke Walton|6
Iggy has been pretty solid each game...and actually so has Barnes. Klay for sure get's the MVP for the OKC series. Draymond might have a slight edge right now but I feel like it's a pretty open competition. I say top scorer on Monday gets the hardware. |Warriors|1
>I say top scorer on Monday gets the hardware.\n\nYou weren't wrong.|[MIA] Dwyane Wade|1
We talkin about practice|Warriors|4
i know this might be a ridiculous statement but he should be front runner for FMVP after that game.  I know he wasn't that good in the past three games but this was the first game that felt needed a superstar effort from one of the players and Steph was the one that delivered (kyrie too but they lost)|Lakers|5
I agree, and I would like to add that at least 30 of his 38 points were clutch tonight.|Warriors|3
https://vine.co/v/itUKYJ3laUD\n||5
wtf he scored 38? so quietly too. it amazes me that he can score almost 40 and i don't even really notice it happening|Celtics|14
He had a good amount of sly layups throughout the game & hit some nice 3s in the clutch. \n\nCombine his quick cuts to the lane, 10 FTA & legendary 3PT shot, then 38 points is easy money.\n\nAlso props to his squad for having the ball flow around constantly to keep Cavs defense on its toes, allowed Curry to sneak & push a ton.|[LAL] Luke Walton|15
he missed so many freebies too. |Timberwolves|7
Who gets MVP in this series? That's what I'm wondering now. Can you just give it to the team?|Heat|9

Vince and T Mac said him shooting bad in practice was a sign he was going to have a great game|Pistons|237
Honestly that\'s just bullshit to me. What a meaningless "insight." It\'s like saying "LeBron has sprained his leg - it\'s a sign he\'s going to be quick and spry in the game tonight."\n\nSometimes I think these former player-analysts are really just pulling shit out of their ass.|Heat|-40
If you heard their drawn out explanation and not my summary then it might make more sense.  These are two guys who played the game at the highest level.  I trust their experience over your skepticism.  And they were right...|Pistons|49
Also it's not injury related|Warriors|3
Steph didn\'t look like he was happy with his elbow at the end of the game; he did that little "flex the elbow while holding it in the other hand and grimace" maneuver.|Warriors|2
Get all the bad shots early||1
I honestly thought TMac and VC were full of shit when they said that... But they were right. |Warriors|21
yeah its possible over-confidence with the 3 is bad going into a game. Like Klay was stepping up and taking 30 footers when he was starting 0-5 in the last game. It's way better when Curry and Klay get hot with natural shots before taking crazy ones.|Warriors|44
Crazy to think that those 11 missed free throws could have changed the game completely. The Cavs just looked defeated even when they were still within reach.||947
Meh, if they shot league average for free throws they would have only scored 4-5 more points. Not enough to make a difference.||0
I said it after last game and I'll say it again this game - Cavs are playing scared.  Even when they are winning, they look like they're losing.  They're a BIG talented team.  They need to use their size and play stronger defense.|Raptors|1
That 4th Quarter just had to be deflating. Cavs were trying to keep up and then the lead jumped to double digits and you could really just feel the air being let out of the crowd and the Cavs themselves. |Lakers|1
> The Cavs just looked defeated even when they were still within reach.\n\nIt definitely has something to do with the Warriors. I saw the same thing from the Thunder in game 7. ||1
If they had shot their season percentage of 73%, they would have made 4 more free throws.\n\nWould have helped, but wouldn't have won the game for them.|[GSW] Chris Mullin|1
Too many minutes for the starters but cavs bench can't pick up the slack. Cavs were fine up until the last q and just started standing around on offense.|Hornets Bandwagon|1
Well golden state missed 7 fts so if you wanna use that lame argument then it wouldn't have made a difference.|Warriors|2
Same thing that happened in 1 and 2, Warriors go on a run, clamp down on defense it it resulted in the same Lebron iso, Kyrie drive every single drive for them. Scoreless for 6 minutes, pathetic.|Bulls|5
Most of the Warriors players seem to step up when it's clutch time and the going gets tough. Can't really say the same for most of the Cavs players. |Cavaliers|2
devastating to trade 3s for 2s in the 4th. its death to trade 3s for 0-2 from the line. |Lakers|3
They were tired. I hate this dialogue around the lack of drive. I think the Cavs are fucking gassed. They have to give 110% to match the Warriors at 90-100%. They can't do that for the whole game.|Celtics|15
not to mention, they have to play insane minutes because they have no bench.|Pacers|9
Meanwhile, Kerr barely played Speights or Barbosa tonight, or really Ezeli. Between the three of them and Ian Clark, 1:25 of game time total. |Warriors|3
That stretch where they missed something like six in a row and went from up 2 to down 9 absolutely killed them. You can't let this Warriors team get that much momentum|Heat|12
Yeah man. Was really frustrated watching them give up that early. Congrats btw|[CLE] Shaquille O'Neal|20

Klay started the game the same way. It was weird|Warriors|4
They looked gassed , the bench isn't contributing anything so it looks like they didn't have a lot left in the tank after game 3. It's a testament to warriors depth|Heat|82
Same story as last year. Kerr rests starters even in difficult moments to make sure they're fresh for the end of the game. Meanwhile LeBron is leading the series in minutes and everything else and people love it, until the late games of the series|Warriors|3
Ya I mean they don't really hace much of a choice. Take lebron off the floor and warriors will go on a run |Heat|2
Seriously, I feel like this goes unnoticed. Same thing with OKC, KD and Westbrook played unbelievable amounts of minutes and Kerr down 8-12 points would be resting Curry or Thompson with 9 minutes to go. Cavs had to play hard for 8 quarters to beat this team at home.|Kings|9
It's so nice to have a team that misses free throws after those jerks at OKC. |Warriors|297
Steven Adams turning into fucking Curry on the line in that series. smh|Warriors|362
I'm sayin!!!|Warriors|6
I recall seeing Steph/Klay miss more than I saw Adams miss at the line last series..|Warriors|70
Everytime they miss a ft in the playoffs is traumatic to me. Those are supposed to be free points|Warriors|1
I don't get why they were shooting 2's towards the end when GSW FTs are borderline automatic ||447
1. They absolutely were not hitting the 3's the entire second half\n\n2. GSW was giving up the paint\n|Rockets|2
Even with the 2s, they weren't getting on Curry and Thompson fast enough to deny them the ball on the inbounds pass.|Warriors|2
Mental mistakes were aplenty in the fourth.  Their whole approach was wrong.|Spurs|3
With like 47 seconds left they waste 17 and bring it down to 30, make a little layup, then immediately foul Curry and of course he goes down and hits both. What a waste of time and effort. |Warriors|3
None of our offense in the 4th was good, why change it then?||3
they were mentally out of the game|Spurs|3
Warriors knew what they were doin letting Lebron get those layups |Heat|6
Yeah, I'd take FTs by Steph and Klay over 2 pt attempts by anybody, any day.||10

Padding stats.|Warriors|279
[deleted]||-8
LeBron seemed to just drive to the hole every possesion at the end. While he was able to score, those 2points dont really chip away since curry and thompson are almost guaranteed to hit their FTs.\n\nSo it can be seen as padding his stats, since making 2s is almost pointless because 3s, from my perspective, were their only chance of chipping away.||21
Yup. Lebron went from 18 to 25 points in garbage time.|Warriors|6
exactly, lebrons 19 points look weak as fuck but 26 is at least respectable. pretty embarrassing for someone like lebron to do that though.|Celtics|24
not a single 3 was attempted, just blatantly padded stats ||5
as a lebron fan it was sad to watch. you could tell he'd given up.|Celtics|1
Nah fam, he didn't give up. He gave it everything.|[MIA] Dwyane Wade|1
LeBron was clearly padding his stats at the end there, absolutely no reason to not be shooting 3's in that situation. |Bulls|462
What is padding stats?||1
If that was true he would have gone for 1 more assist for a triple double|Warriors Bandwagon|4
Not really, he's padding his stats so when they lose the finals he will still have a good line, but He did try for an assist. Remember that long pass Curry stole at the end? |Bulls|10
ended up helping the Splash bros to pad their stats too.|Warriors|19
I hate to think that about someone like Lebron, but it did look like he knew he'd be roasted all weekend if he ended with only 19 points. |Celtics|278
How does someone look like that |[HOU] Tracy McGrady|0
Ain't getting roasted now!|[MIA] Dwyane Wade|1
I mean LeBron did wear a check my stats shirt back in like 2009 or something so he definitely cares about stats|Lakers|1
He remembers his statline from 2011 and got PTSD. Take out the win, and the fluffed 7 points from this game and his statline looks JUST like 2011.||98
That's ridiculous, you can't just pick and choose which stats to keep.||-29
I absolutely can. He plays like shit in losses this series and you absolutely cannot assume that his 6-7 points that came when the game required 3s meant anything since the Warriors were leaving the paint open. ||20
It's called standardizing the data and is used in statistics all the time||38
"There\'s lies, there\'s damned lies, and then there\'s statistics."||-34
Great quote. Not even a passable argument though.|Vancouver Grizzlies|42
you can when someone is down 9 with under 2 minutes to play and taking layups |Knicks|64
Some snotty kid in the future is gonna look up this boxscore and say Lebron had a monster game.|Bulls|18
Monster series though...|[MIA] Dwyane Wade|1
You mean tomorrow?||15
The Cavs with the perfect OKC impression tonight. 4th Quarter? Fuck everything we have been doing up to this point and worked, and let's run that marvelous heroball.|NBA|983
defence? what defence? ||1
And really it was very typical ending for GSW as well. Game close with 6 minutes, is usually when Curry & team really comes to life, they clamp down and get a comfortable win. Everyone comes into form when it's crunch time. \n\nThis hero-ball moniker really has been going on for decades and greats become hero's because they have a decent knack of hitting the game winner at the buzzer. GSW typically doesn't let it get that close, which to me as a master strategist... is a better plan. :) It's been happening forever, it's just that we are seeing what we always preached, team better than individual, NBA mostly was against that theory. ||1
They made the same impression because both teams played their stars 44+mpg.  You can't do that and expect to pull out a close win down the stretch against the Warriors who are going to rest their players no matter what.||1
the old habits.....|West|1
Running an offense takes a lot of brainpower, and Kyrie and James both basically played the whole game. When you're tired, you don't want to think, you just want to act. And so ISO ball it is.|Warriors|1
It might not be an excuse but fatigue has *got* to be a factor in this. When you're tired, you're sloppy both ways. You don't hustle in defense for the rebounds and you most certainly don't want to run your offense which takes a lot of off-ball movement, passing, etc. Instead you opt out for these lazy ISO plays. |Warriors|1
Honestly, this was exactly what I was thinking. Except the OKC game seemed like much better basketball||1
Which is really weird because Lebron addressed why he doesn't run heroball very recently|Lakers|1
whats sad is I thought they wouldn't panic and revert to those habits, \nguess I was wrong.|Raptors|1
I mean, Kyrie was playing hero ball before the fourth quarter. The difference is his shots stopped going in (and GSW got way more aggressive on the boards)|Bulls|1
Well said. Couldn't have described it any better. |Cavaliers|1
Blame Lebron and lue ||1
Well to be fair, those last two games of gsw v okc, if klay or curry had missed those shots, you wouldve said the same about them playing heroball. |Lakers|2
Hey man, that hurts :( |Thunder|2
If my face wasn't numb from drinking I'd cry|Thunder|2
they ran out of mental gas and talent. It's not surprising that a team that fights super hard and plays their stars big minutes don't have cerebral fortitude in last quarter. It's not necc. a choking thing, it's physical.|Warriors|2
To be fair, the defense in the third was as much of a culprit as the offense in the fourth. They just didn't have a good second half and that's why they lost.|Raptors|2
I cry every 4th quarter. The heros come out but the scoreboard doesn't change. At least our half of the board.||2
http://i.imgur.com/VvVjens.jpg|Thunder|11
This is exactly what happened, the parallels are so real - Kyrie and LeBron iso plays over and over just like Russ and KD. Something about these 4th quarters man.|[BOS] Kevin Garnett|354
It seems like they go down by 5 points with 8 min left and just start panicking and forget everything they were doing the whole entire game|Bulls|1
The Warriors made both teams feel like they couldn't rest their starters, and their guys just looked like they ran out of gas down the stretch.  It's too tiring chasing Klay and Steph for 44+ minutes.  Those Warrior bench minutes are so valuable to keep the starters fresh too.|Bullets|2
Those plays where they'd get a good stop and Kyrie would push it and force the bad shot||2
Same down to the two gassed stars who played the entire 2nd half.  And Irving seems a less natural PG than westbrook.|NBA|4
It\'s because the Warriors simply don\'t go away and people get desperate while the Warriors go "... okay." and don\'t change a damn thing.||12
It's fatigue. Players don't have that same energy to do so many screens and move off the ball so often in the shot clock, especially when you gotta lock in so much on the other end. I believe Kyrie, JR, and LeBron all played more than 43 minutes, LeBron played 45.5. Also this is the only game in the series with only 1 day off. |Celtics|7
The Warriors have been the best team in close games by a large margin all year.  Partially because their depth allows the starters to rest, partially because they execute well.  Why is the narrative that there's some magic thing that makes other teams choke? It's good defense, having more energy, and clutch shooting ffs!|Warriors|9
OKC actually won more than one game though.|Thunder|8
There's probably some deep-seated trust issues on these teams. They don't think anyone will get it done but themselves. That's something that can't be bought/trained. The W's were shit and developed together, but look at their chemistry now.    \nEdit: Alright, I get it.  But deep-seeded almost makes sense in a metaphorical way (though seeds sown too deeply won\xe2\x80\x99t grow).|Warriors|260
Yea and this is why Kerr got coty and the owner talked about them being light years ahead. \n\nLooks like they found the secret formula other teams are gonna copy like the patriots or even ljek the As with money ball. \n\nBesides green and 99% of warriors fans, this is truly a great team/franchise||-1
it does make sense in a figurative way, i agree||1
Can they trust those people though? I don't think these extras on the Cavs and okc are really that good. The warriors stars know they can trust anyone on the team...... bc they can.||1
I think its more that Kyrie is a ballhog and hes been doing hero ball his entire basketball career |[TOR] Amir Johnson|1
That's a good point and I feel like LeBron, Westbrook and Durant being such vocal leaders and also superstars of their squad that there must be some really big mental obligation for them to implement their leadership by trying to take games over.||1
You guys just have a demoralizing defense |Cavaliers|2
oh fuck lol, im with you, i thought it was 'deep-seeded.' we both learned something today.  but nah you're right, the warriors just play with an awareness and synchronization that a lot of teams just dont have.||2
It\'s "deep seated"... just so you know for next time...||2
I think Jackson said it in one of the games, when they get stressed they start taking turns and it doesn't work. There was like 8 possessions in a row, Lebron would bring it up: iso. Kyrie would bring it up: iso and repeat. ZERO passing.|Bulls|7

Rooted =/= seeded||1
no|West|2
I\'m no psychologist, but I think there\'s another explanation instead of it being a trust issue. Feeling the responsibility to play hero ball doesn\'t necessarily mean they don\'t trust their teammates.\n\n I think it more stems from watching their heros seemingly play hero ball and take over crucial games, and then doing it themselves on their own all the way up until they make the pros, and during regular season.  But what was really happening was just that they were so focused on their idols when they were young, that they didn\'t fully grasp the big picture of winning as a team.  For the most part, it does work for them, and they made it this far believing it.   Also during the course of an 82 game season, they have a lot of games to cover up when the hero ball doesn\'t work, so on average, it has worked in the pros too (remember, pro athletes have to be able to forget their failures to focus on their successes).  \n\nBut in the playoffs, your performance in each and every game is under a microscope.  When hero ball works, you are a god. When it doesn\'t, you are anything but. \n\nSo in situations like this, they\'re reverting to their instincts that have largely worked for them their entire lives,  thinking, "my team needs me, I\'ve gotta take over, just like my hero did."  It usually works for them, but tonight, it did not. And every night in the playoffs that it doesn\'t work, we notice it a lot more. \n\ntl;dr  It\'s not you, it\'s me. |Toronto Huskies|13
Meanwhile Steph Curry had one game in college where he stood in the corner and let his teammates win. Curry came in averaging 35 after 5 games and the opposing coach thought they had no chance after watching him warmup. The opposing coach decided to double curry and literally go 3 on 4 with everyone else. \n\nEdit: tbh, this really doesn't mean anything, but your comment made me remember it. |[IND] Paul George|8

I've never noticed it until now but I think Lebron genuinely hates Steph. |[GSW] Ian Clark|913
Well Curry is basically fucking up the tail end of his legacy.|Timberwolves|2
Lebrons a pretty reasonable man|Magic|10
So he definitely hates him.|Supersonics|18
Theres a video of him jamming to " Fuck Steph Curry Song"||2
Has been reported a few times that he's mad jealous..||10
I think this season has shown that LeBron doesn't like not being considered the unanimous King. Even in Miami people hated him but we all still knew he was the best. This season with all the Curry love he just started to go into diva mode. |Pistons|10
I definitely don't think they like each other very much.|Spurs|7
I don't think so, he just got super heated once he knew they lost. ||74
Lol|Lakers|-7
Don't say Heat|Wizards|1
Nah bruh this is clearly psychological murder|Warriors|2
he hates Steph cause Steph gave his point guard three hezzies. [THREE HEZZIES DOE. Not 1, not 2, but THREE HEZZIES](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wX3eoMeXmzg).||12

And that nerdy kid takes rings from you years later. What a time to be alive.|NBA|16
its for sure weird. usually superstars who are adversaries have mutual respect for each other (kobe-lebron, kobe-garnett/pierce, durant-lebron). I feel like there is no relationship with these two.||14
It's not like Kobe/LeBron ever had a real rivalry though and LeBron handed KD's ass to him about every time they played.||10
I vaguely remember a video from the 2014 all star game or the olympics where Lebron is joking with Curry about how Curry schooled his point guard. Seems pretty friendly then. \n\nEdit: found it http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=wX3eoMeXmzg|Celtics|6
He's no longer the top dog and it's hurting his ego. \n\nAbsolutely love it. |Rockets|569
I don't think it's that, he's better than Steph as an overall player, but Steph has an amazing supporting cast that LeBron is probably jealous of. As well as a better coach.|Suns|-24
That's what happens when you don't give GM LeBron full reign of the organization. LeBron is the better overall player, but dude can't shoot to save his life atm. |Warriors|0

> humility\n\nWow, the narrative literally flipped 180\xc2\xb0 in less than 2 weeks. This sub is incredible.|NBA|1
At what point can we stop blaming the supporting cast? Hes got the most expensive team ever and he picked these players. |Nets|192
Payroll was the result of Gilbert willingly overspending. \n\nedit: I'm not saying LeBron doesn't have a good supporting cast. I'm just saying the overspending is what caused the highest budget ever. $120 million for Love and $82 million for thompson|Cavaliers|-6
It'd be damn near impossible to pick out a better supporting cast than what Steph has in Golden State. |Timberwolves|38
Yeah but it the Cavs still have a very good one. It isnt like its Lebron against the world.|Celtics|7

Yeah but he didnt realize he needed more chuckers. He's angry at himself for that and projects his anger onto the most prolific chucker of all time, who just so happens to be stealing the spotlight from him.|Bulls|49
Needs more chuckers???|Bulls|6
Yes, he needs to go to the Chucker Hut and pick up some extra Chucker.|Bulls|1
More chuckers?\n\nJ.R Smith, Mo Williams, Kevin Love, Matt Dellavedova, and Channing Frye all like to shoot. Cavs don't need chuckers, they need to play less iso. A lot less. |Jazz|22
This thread is full of some of the dumbest "analysis" I have ever seen. "LeBron doesn\'t hate Steph he hates himself because he didn\'t recruit players like him," "Draymond is the type of player every team needs he\'s a fighter and responds to the hate from the crowd," "11 missed free throws really had an effect on the game." \n\nComments like these are one step away from going full Skip Bayless\n||-6
Della never shoots.. Frye is a big man who seems to have lost his shot.. the team looks like it needs an explosive player off the bench.. |Lakers|9
Frye hasn't lost a thing, he just isn't getting minutes or opportunities to shoot.|Raptors|3
He doesn't need more chuckers but teammates that actually have complete skillsets. |Bulls|16
He made a team in 2014 to win titles and they were perfectly constructed to do that. They are custom built to stomp the East (they do) then beat the Spurs or the Thunder in the Finals (Regular season: 2-2 vs SA and 3-1 vs OKC). What happened is they (along with the other 28 teams) weren't expecting the Warriors to come out of nowhere and change all the rules. People want to shit on LeBron and the Cavs roster, but this is simply a threat no one anticipated or the Warriors wouldn't follow a 67 win and title season with 73 fucking wins and probably another title.|Warriors|49
Kyrie / Dion / Bron / Love / Varejao still fucking sucks at defense and that's the lineup GM LeBron built...|Braves|-1
Agreed completely. Guy makes it to the Finals in his first 2 seasons back in Cleveland. Just happens to go up against a team that completely outdo them in match ups. Doesn't help that they had arguabley one of the greatest seasons of all time this year either.||20
>Doesn't help that they had arguabley one of the greatest seasons of all time this year either.\n\n73 - 9. There's no argument about whether this was one of the greatest.\n||14
[deleted]||1
'One of the greatest'. It'll be top 3 in anyone's language. Top spot would be personal preference. I'd say the Bulls were more intimidating but that's the era I grew up in and nostalgia plays a part. As an Aussie, mate,we are represented either way!||2
[deleted]||2
I don't think the warriors work with lebron or westbrook or most not curry superstars. They'd still be good, but only curry would make them a 73 win team|Bulls|28
I think its that LeBron has unquestionably been the face of the NBA for a while and this kid comes out of freaking nowhere to not only eclipse him, but take his Cleveland rings.|[CHI] Michael Jordan|104
Yeah. He's gotta be pissed that GSW basically rained on his #ComingHome parade last year.|[DAL] Dirk Nowitzki|83
The Warriors broke the Bulls single season record. Curry is taking winning in the latter end of LeBron's career. As great as LeBron is, I think he'll be in MJ and Kobe's shadow. He's watching his legacy diminish before his eyes. Coming home has not gone as planned|Heat|76
This is the first time i feel like im watching lebron feel threatened by another basketball player on the court. and i love it/hate it as a big lebron fan during the dark days between we believe and now|Warriors|12
All because of one skinny scrappy dude with funny Under Armours :D||41
He's definitely the top dog still. He's just not in the top team. |Raptors|2
Lebron is no longer the top dawg lol. Curry was mentally broken by James and outplayed by the real MVP. And Lebron picked up his 3rd ring too. Love that. ||2
LeBron is a balding, steroid popping, whiny bitch and he's not better than Curry or KD. Love that. |Rockets|0
Curry got completely outplayed by Lebron and Kyrie plus Steph choked and lost a 3-1 lead. And KD isn't on Lebron's level you delusional fan. Love that.||2
You think so? I think Lebron was just mad. Which is surprising because Lebron rarely blows up.||16
Steph makes Lebron super insecure it's hilarious ||65
Are you serious?...|Raptors|-1
Do you blame him? I would hate most of the guys on the warriors too if they took title chances from you in back to back seasons. Its not over yet but its basically over. |Warriors|33
No I agree. It's the first time it spilled out but that was a menacing convo those two were having on the court. Completely out of character for bron. |Thunder|22
I mean Ayesha over there doing her mom of the year shit, steph draining 3's and winning ships, dominating the male nurse shoe market, why wouldn't Lebron be pissed? He hand picked this team and still can't win\n\nEdit: Show to shoe because I was drunk \xf0\x9f\x99\x83||640
His mom is hot, his whole family is still together, his daughter is lighting up post game interviews. I would be pissed too.||2

Only win at home|Mavericks|1
Both game 3 and 4 were away. I don't see why you would risk game 3 for the chance of giving them hope and making it 2-2 at the end of game 4 and not 3-1 after being 3-0.|Raptors|1
Maybe their plan was to lose game 4 but they accidentally won?|Mavericks|1
So that they could then win the next 2 and not in at home... or what, risk the chance of losing game 7?|Raptors|1
Only home wins, so looks like their plan all along was to take it to seven|Mavericks|1
I think they've lost Game 3 in most 7 game series under Kerr. It's a thing.|Warriors|6
LeBron was acting so smug after game 3 I'm glad he got his ass handed to him.|Timberwolves|66
Nah||-29
LeBrown's team got beat tonight yes, but I wouldn't say he got his ass handed to him. He was an assist shy of a triple double and shot over 50% from the field. Cavs kept it close most of the game and had the lead for a good portion too. Their loss tonight is not comparable to the blowout they handed the Warriors on Wednesday. If you're LBJ, you're allowed to act a little smug after destroying the reigning champs who are led by the first unanimous MVP ever by 30. And this is coming from someone who's rooting for the Dubs.|Clippers|-28
lol don't even cite his stats. his obvious stat padding makes everything he did in the last minute just bs.|Timberwolves|29
> he got his ass handed to him\n\n> don't even cite his stats\n\nI love this sub, but sometimes the things people say here blow my fucking mind.|Clippers|-8
Stats doesn't always mean impact on the game you idiot. Stats don't mean shit when he didn't take over the game. Add onto the free layups he got at the end just to get his points higher, his stat sheet is useless. He lost handily.|Lakers|4
Well when all you care about is personal numbers to keep people thinking you\'re the "best" it\'s pretty hard to think the dude ever wants to win. As long as LBJ has good numbers he doesn\'t care||5
He had so many chances to tear into the paint and take over but chose to pass instead. The numbers might be nice and all but could have been so much more effective ||13

The Warriors' ability to contain Lebron tonight was exceptional!\n\nHe even lost his temper!\n\nSeriously though, Golden State did an amazing job of limiting Lebron's effectiveness on offense tonight.|Warriors|378
You mean fouling him and not getting calls? Yea, they did an awesome job.|Cavaliers|-114
Curry was being mugged off the ball, so? Ya know we complain the game is too soft these days but run to mommy the first sign of physicality these days to. So what do we want? Or are we just insane? \n\nAs the playoffs progress each series still gets more physical and less is called, which imo like then, like now it's better basketball viewing. Do we really want both teams that the line all the time? B Ball back in the day, there was a lot more idle time at the line during games. This is better basketball to watch and to me everything seemed pretty evened out. \n\nThe whole should Green be suspended a game? If that happens that is total bull, much a do about nothing happened that play and each was as equally guilty doing that nothingness. We want bully ball, but then want people thrown out over a slight brushing of emotions.||2
LeBron is one of the players that can get away with murder on the court simply because he's LeBron. It's hilarious||17
they didnt call fouls on warriors also. It was called evenly on both side. The referees were equal on both sides. |Warriors|49

I felt it was more lebron not being able to finish rather than Warriors D. Obviously the warriors had some solid D, but I just saw it as lebron not being able to finish. ||-5
Just as a side note, it\'s probably a testament to LeBron\'s greatness that being an assist away from a triple double while shooting over 50% in a game is considered "containing" him. Though, I agree, they did a pretty great job since half his stats felt like they came in the last 2 minutes||-3

He did that when the rest of his team was being trash. There were atleast 3 Cav players in double digits before LeBron, and Love was playing well too. Until the fourth quarter, when its all about me. The difference is someone on GSW had to step up, vs tonight where it was neck and neck most of the game UNTIL cavs started iso'ing.|Warriors Bandwagon|11
Hero ball is fine if you win haha. Hero ball doesn't look so good when your iso's result in 7 minutes without making a FG in the 4th quarter.||37
So you're judging the result, not the process? Seems rather shallow, but alright |Heat|-22
bruh you good |Lakers|1
Sports are about winning. Winning depends on the result. So yes, I am. Enjoy your high horse, which would probably come last at the Belmont Stakes. ||26
Honestly though, Lebron would fit so well with the Dubs scheme, right? He\'s a great passer and defender. And I don\'t think Lebron wants to constantly play hero ball, he just does it because it\'s his only choice. I know it\'s a stupid point to make by saying "put the best player on the best team" but I do think he would fit better than someone like Durant. |Warriors|1
dont worry, i wouldn't want him on our team anyways is what I was getting at.|Warriors|27
What a hot take.|Heat|1
Lol ok.\n\nedit: getting a lot of replies saying they agree with the implication that GS fans don't want lebron on their team..\n\nalright, don't care if I get downvoted, and in fact lebron has been responsible for a lot of misery for me as a celtics fan, but you're all extremely delusional. there are 0 teams in NBA history that adding lebron to doesn't make them better. you guys have a tenuous grasp of basketball if you don't understand that.|Celtics|5
They're arguing his personality wouldn't match not his ability. Of course he has the ability but he's always played on one man or two man teams save those two seasons in Miami they won rings. The warriors are a extremely complete team, the Cavs are an extremely incomplete team(and the highest paid team I think). It's LeBron vs the world again. I almost feel sorry for him. Other than bosh and wade he has never had great teammates and it's molded him into a player that does it alone. Even though the nba is a league of stars, few do it alone. I'm sure some have (Dwayne wade before LeBron comes to mind) but it's rare and I'd think it'd be easier with a defensive team, which the Cavs are complete opposite of.||2
Look at how Lebron plays.. he wants to drive and dish and get players involved. He's a giant Magic Johnson, he doesn't want nor is capable of being a Kobe type.. that's what I'm saying this is an inherent misunderstanding of what type of player he is.. what I'm saying is not revolutionary or not commonly acknowledged which is why I'm baffled by the response. \n\nFirst year in Miami a big part of why they lost is because Lebron wanted to defer, not because he wanted to take over and jack up 40 shots, he's the ultimate team player with the skill set to back it. |Celtics|1
But everyone has always compared him to Jordan so that's what people expect even though that's not who he is. Also bc of his play style that you mentioned he is more often than not very reliant on his team for scoring and it hasn't worked for him. Quality players don't want to go to cleveland. So it's draft picks only and when he's there they can't start great players bc he's too good so he leaves and when he comes back he makes them trade all their lottery picks for equally questionable players that are closer to retiring. ||0
Lol why tf is this guy getting downvoted?||5
People who have been warriors fans for the past 2 years think they're basketball masterminds. This sub has been atrocious lately.|Celtics|6
Yeah, the Warriors really need to figure out some changes or they might win again next year.  /s|Warriors|1
When almost all of your team is making less than 15m each you eventually have to make compromises and make smart decisions with trades and free agency.. you don't get to bring back the exact same team every year in sports.. |Celtics|3
I actually 100% agree. It would be poison to our team. Let's forget about his ego butting heads with Kerr's plays, he would hurt our chemistry. He is too much the blaming type to gel with the Warriors|Warriors|34
honestly why would you? they just won 73 and are about to win back to back, why would you add a superstar that inherently changes the chemistry of the team?|Timberwolves|31
Because he is the best basketball player in the world|Hawks|-11
your mind amazes me|Lakers|9
He can get his minutes as a 6th man. |Warriors|50
Yeah, if Iggy leaves to get paid LeBron would be a decent replacement. Needs to work on his three though.|Warriors|36

It's gone full circle. Iggy is no longer the poor man's Lebron and LeBron is the poor man's Iggy.|Lakers|18
Kerr -  Guys, keep thompson down. Hes smashing us in rebounds and energy on the paint. Cant afford to let him continue playing like this. We have to shut him down!\n\n\nLue -  Dw Kerr i got this. Yo Tristan, come, take a seat. |Warriors|276
You win best comment. I thought Tristan could be the Cavs version of Iggy last year. That player that just swings the series but then Lue happened |Grizzlies|0
Thompson was actually in the game when warriors had their biggest offensive rebounds. He was just gassed because he was playing all quarter where as Dray and Barnes had some time to sit before the 4th.|Warriors|15

That isn\'t saying "something positive though", thats making an excuse for the fact that your team played horrible and is an incredibly arrogant thing to do.\n|Timberwolves|-1

That would have been epic |Warriors|3
Losing ain't so bad but the way LeBron was acting was embarrassing. Getting into it with Draymond instead of playing, roughing up Curry then getting in his face about it, stat padding to end the game...smh|Heat|394
When did he get in curry's face? I totally missed that, is there a video clip of it anywhere?||3
During the last 2 minutes on an inbounds play. Lebron was yanking at Curry's jersey and pulling and fouling him to deny the entry pass. Curry complained to the refs because GSW were forced to use a timeout. Lebron got in his face for complaining.|Lakers|19
Lebron legit threw him like a rag doll like 3 times curry had every right to complain and he rarely does. Lebron bitching cause his 200m team he picked is gonna lose.|Lakers|9
Last year he basically slide-tackled Curry in the finals as well. The dude has some nasty jealousy spikes||29

He definitely had a right to complain there, but let's not say he complains rarely. I'm not sure if I've seen him get called for anything without making a face and walking out to half court.|Suns|2
How is that complaining? He can't show emotions? Running up to ref every play and bitching cause you know they wouldn't give you a T is complaining (Lebron...Cp3... Draymond....)|Lakers|1
Of course he can show emotions, but based on his reactions you'd think he's never committed a legitimate foul in his life. The other guys you mentioned definitely complain as well, but not after every single call that doesn't go their way.|Suns|0
That's his schtick |[GSW] Shaun Livingston|43

This is why people, like myself, don't like him.|Lakers|44

"I\'m gonna join you next year. I\'m taking draymond\'s spot."||1
No they need Durant. So LeBron can continue losing. It's funnier that way. ||1
LeBron was trying to get Draymond to commit a flagrant foul. ||40
"What do I have to do to get a double technical around here?"\n-Lebron to ref|Lakers|23
Don't see why he was in Curry's face then. Lebron just seemed mad.||29

You simply don't cheer for the opposing team in the finals mid game.   Andy is still loved in Cleveland.   |Cavaliers|3
Did you see that crowd? What else do you expect from them?|Heat|15
Yup, I saw that crowd.  I know Miami fans are not used to people actually watching the game but it happened.  |Cavaliers|-5
Omfg killed his ass how did I miss this last week ||1
Just mob mentality. No logic in the booing|NBA|88
My guess is the logic is he signed with the enemy. Not gonna lie, I would do the same thing to the team that traded me after I spent so much time there without winning. |Cavaliers|-14
Cavs were pretty good for a lot of Anderson's career there. They had 4 losing seasons in his time there. I don't like them booing him, but still it's not like Andy dealt with terrible circumstances his whole time in Cleveland.|Cavaliers|10
he had a handful of injuries, especially that 2013 season IIRC, he had a borderline all star season before his injury (14 & 14)\n\nhe definitely dealt with a bunch|Lakers|2
cavs fan||1
It's the realisation that he's going to get a ring before the Cavs do... The fans are almost as butthurt as Lebron seems to be|Trail Blazers|46
Fuck off.  Any regular season game he would, and still will, get a standing O.  You don't cheer for the opposing team in the finals.  |Cavaliers|2
Before Game 1 of the Finals, he was already a champion.|Warriors|14
Was this ever proven? Some people on here were saying if the Cavs hypothetically won they would not be required to give Andy a ring, it would be up to their discretion. |Lakers|4
It's in the rule book somewhere. If you have a certain amount of games on a team in one season and are traded away/cut before the end of it and they win, you're entitled to a ring. The magic number was like 32 or something||11
meh, if i was anderson right now and the cavs won this series I'd kinda feel like I didn't deserve it so much|Lakers|2
All series long I've wanted to see Varejao play and dominate his old team.  Sure, it was only against Kevin Love, but it was still satisfying to watch.  |Rockets|122

Thats quite a reach, no i, nor any leftist would support genocide if the state did it. Idk where you get that from. Also while he government is prone to fucking shit up it can be the best solution to problems somwtimes|Mavericks|1
People whine and bitch about how corrupt it is and the services provided either suck or are unnecessarily costly. Yet the institution is defended like a religion is. Look past all the mistakes, the fact that politicians and their cronies are above the laws they create, suuure a mistake can lead to the deaths of thousands of people... it's all necessary for the government to exist.|Spurs|1
Actually he services provided are really helpful or can be when implemented correctly and while they may cost they give out more than what ypu wpuld have otherwise. Take single payer healthcare for instance. But what you say is because there are problems with a system (as with every human system) we should scrap it entirly and let corporations do to us what we dont want the government to do, but to an exponentially worse degree|Mavericks|1

Can anyone for a sec look what LeBron did at the end of the game. It shouldn't go unnoticed. Down 10 and 4 straight positions, should I take a three or pass to an open man for a three? Nope drive it and pad my stats 4 straight plays to not even try to come back. It's pathetic. He choked but of course they'll look at his stats and say HERP DERP HE NEEDS HELP. ||284
[deleted]||-1
Hoping the best FT shooting back court in the league would miss enough for his layups to tie the game up with less than a minute and no timeouts remaining... yea the math doesn't add up.||10
LeBron needed one more assist today for a trible double. So passing for a three could've been a win-win, both for his stats and the team.||1
I wouldn't even say he choked. Every time he got to his spot, the dubs got the ball out of his hands. He'd get the mismatch he'd want and instant double team. The man literally couldn't do shit. ||3
Why doesn't he just do that when the game is getting out of hand? He realistically can score when he really wants to. I just don't get it. I know I don't play against anyone near the same level as an NBA player but if I'm the best guy on the court and we need a bucket in taking that shit to the hole. He does that better than anyone. So frustrating to watch as a LeBron fan.|Heat|20
Warriors let him into the paint.  |Bulls|5
I honestly don't know. Does he get scared or something. It's so frustrating to watch and pisses me off. Watching kobe for my whole life then LeBron just makes me dislike so much. His ability to shoot really hurts him and when he drives he gets doubled. But I feel he can always drive but he shys away. When it doesn't work for him he gets afraid of missing and doesn't take over. Not right ||13
Right. He will only get going when his jumper is on. He doesn't get himself going. At least that's what it seems like most of the time. Idk it's frustrating but I'll always love his game. One of my favorites to watch.|Heat|5
You just can't call yourself the best in the game and be afraid to take the big shots.||6
Nah the warriors were letting him get anything he wanted inside at the end.  They just didn't want 3s or fouls because they knew they wouldn't choke the long game.|Warriors|19
But he does get to the paint. So three things happen there, he kicks it out to a shooter, goes up for a layup/dunk, or the defender (usually Klay, Danny Green is good at this too) will swipe at the ball before he even jumps and force a turnover. But he can get in the paint although it is not effortlessly, that's an exaggeration to say he does it so easily.|Heat|2
True, but the difference was that at the end, when Cleveland started fouling, Lebron didn't expend any energy to get into the pain and there was no contest.  There was also no help defense because the warriors didn't want him to kick out for a three.  |Warriors|3
Can I say that perhaps LeBron has Jordan's eye for roster building?|Bucks|11
This doesn't get said enough. With Wiggins the Cavs would be a much better team. ||2
Eh? Not really|Magic|3
LeBron used to take over games and had a pretty reliable 3 pointer when called upon. Nowadays his accuracy from downtown is atrocious! When did he lose that skill? ||45
He is still pretty good in the clutch if you ask me. Shot a pretty good 3P% this series I think.|Nuggets|1
Ever since he's really started having back issues his jump shot has been broken. That, and his shooting form is horribly inconsistent. ||3
His shot was always bad. His form is terrible so it's inconsistent. He practiced it a lot when he was younger because he wanted to play pretty. He doesn't shoot nearly as much anymore and his jank ass form isn't one that will let you shoot well unless you're shooting it all the time.||8
When he left Miami he changed. His shot was never great but this is worse than it's ever been. ||32
When curry absorbed it. That's how he has all the threes.||20

draymond might be unlikeable but you want him on your team\n\nhe\'s always willing to fight and when you\'re in games like this you need a fighter\n\n[if too many guys just back down and let guys like james literally walk over or on them then that\'s how you get disrespected and teams will physically intimidate you](https://i.imgur.com/5TCW02F.png)\n\nif you don\'t have a guy like green then cleveland probably fights back in this fourth and maybe wins\n\ndon\'t like green but he\'s a gamer at least, regardless of his attitude\n\njust look at him doing anything he can with 3 mins left to keep that ball out of the net and out of cleveland\'s hands\n\nthat\'s how you win championships\n\nthe crowd doesn\'t intimidate him it just amps him up more and drives him to play harder and piss everyone in the arena off\n\nyou gotta have fighters on your team that are going to get in people\'s faces or else it\'s gonna be open season on your teammates and you\'re gonna get rolled and knocked around when it matters\n\n[kerr knew that and that\'s why he publicly called his team "soft" because it\'s true and he knew they needed to hear it.](http://espn.go.com/nba/playoffs/2016/story/_/id/16105116/nba-playoffs-2016-golden-state-warriors-soft) draymond said curry got \'punked\' last game and he was right and look how curry played tonight. remember green flippin his shit last game on the bench? that\'s how he is and it\'s a good thing. everyone else just dejected and taking a beating without getting angry about it. not green tho.\n\nhe looked out of control doing it last game but now you know that it was the right thing to do. that\'s how sports can be sometimes.||839

This is what the Magic needed with Dwights teams back in 07-10. That finals vs Kobe in particular... I mean we had matt barnes but he never really got other guys into it.\n\nTurky, Rashard, Jameer, Dwight, reddick, courtney lee... That was one soft ass team|Magic|1
I don't understand why there's so much hate for green. He balls his ass off every night and does everything on the court for GSW. He might get away with some dirty plays here and there, but it's not like he blatantly tries to hurt the other team minus the ball kicking thing. Every superstar has set a dirty pick or thrown an unnecessary elbow before, and it's not like he complains and cries to the ref every play like some other guys. \n\nHe's lthat dude you love to have on your team in a pick up game but hate having to play against him. ||1
Hes got a pretty solid front kick too. Accurate as fuck also. ||1

This is why I love Draymond, the dude is relentless and wills the team to victory. I remember in the series against the Rockets last year and they were down at halftime and he was caught saying something along the lines of "keep on attacking! they will fucking crack I guarantee it". Curry may be the best player on the team but Draymond is the fearless leader. |Warriors|3
This sums it up well. You need the fire at the heart of every good team, you need the intensity. Sometimes it's all just in one player. \n\nThat's where the polarizing nature of Green comes from though, because everyone wants a guy kike that and so when he plays AGAINST them it's aggravating|Warriors|3

He was talking to Dwight Howard when he was with the Rockets. [Here's a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qhphJvg09Ik). Best part is that Kobe's still talking shit even after an intentional elbow to the face.||4
Didn't think I had a shot in the dark at getting an answer. Phenomenal. Thank you.||3
This just makes me angry we never got the Kobe-Lebron finals , the trash talking alone, from kobe , would've made for so many soundbites |Knicks|46
they should have alternate sound channel that you can just hear the entire court mic'd up. i would pay so much for that|Warriors|2
Meh... Kobe has the utmost respect for Bron (though I'm sure he's glad he has fewer than 5).\n\nActually, come to think of it, maybe in '09 it'd have been great when LeBron was anointed best player in the league while Kobe was putting up 34-6-6 on 63% TS% (and yes I remember somehow LeBron was better in the ECF, but I'm sure Kobe felt disrespected anyways).||7
I feel like we've all forgotten parts of Kobe's history.  This isn't super related, but I've seen a lot of comparisons b/w Bron and Kobe recently saying if it was Kobe then blah blah, but Kobe's disappeared before and Kobe's never been able to carry a team the way Lebron has.\n\nCase in point - http://www.nba.com/games/20060506/LALPHX/recap.html\n\nHe just gave up in game 7.|Celtics|-7
Re: Game 7, here are the words from his own mouth:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvnauVtNA6Q\n\nI\'m inclined to agree with him. Kobe averaged 35.4 ppg that season. I distinctly remember what our offensive strategy was in that series. We were actually running Kwame post ups. Slow the game down. As a result? 28 ppg in that series. In wins? 23.3 ppg, on 21.7 used possessions (FGA + FT/2). In losses? 31 ppg, on 25.5 used possesions.\n\nIn Game 4, when they made the  comeback? It was a team effort.\n\nI know I\'m not going to change your mind. Been on the internet long enough. But I remember this game clearly. And I don\'t think he "gave up": he made a concerted effort to get the ball to his teammates, and they failed. He scored 50 ppg, including 12 in OT, the previous game, and they still lost. Should he have taken over and see what happens? In retrospect, it\'d have been better, sure. Hindsight is 20/20. Does that mean he "gave up"? I don\'t see it.\n\n\n---\n\nThe rest of your post (regarding LeBron vs. Kobe etc.) is so loaded that I\'d spend hours unpacking it just to address it properly. I\'ll pass on that one. We have our beliefs on that and we\'re not going to change our minds.\n||7
I saw that interview and I guess I'm just saying LeBron gets destroyed for not being aggressive enough when his goal is basically the exact same thing.  This wasn't so much targeted at you so much as other posts I have seen all too often criticizing LeBron and saying Kobe would've taken every shot and willed them to victory etc. etc.|Celtics|-4
Kobe respects a lot of people, just not on the court; remember he even called that ref a "bundle of sticks" ?|Knicks|12

This is true of all sports. When the Steelers were really good on d in the 2000s there was always a linebacker on the team that was talking shit and trying to fight and wanting to go out make the other teams stars look bad.\n\nAnd in hockey, well you know. https://youtu.be/47VyKzcUt_Q||1
I like Draymond for that reason. Just plays hard, physical basketball and does whatever it takes to get the win. Reminds me of what Jo did for us against Miami in the playoffs.|Bulls|2
When the Pistons had that rock solid team a decade ago with Ben wallace leading that aggressive defense, their play was celebrated as a great tough team defense, now everyone bitches about the slightest bit of contact. The game has changed and so have the fans in a worse way.||2
Draymond is the Warriors Goon.||2
And he'll also act as the muscle so his team doesn't get intimidated by someone like LeBron. A team like GSW who're otherwise smaller and mostly good guys needs Green. ||6

I think Curry came to help but Dray waved him off like "I got this I don\'t need help"||1
he don't need someone to step up tho. the enforcer has a heart of ice. when shit hits the fan its just a party with confetti for draymond.|Pistons|60
Yup. It was obvious Lebron was tryina bait him and anyone else would've fallen for that. The judo take down, no foul, AND the step-over? But Green was cold as fucking ice. Not only does he *remain in the game and get the rebound, afterwards he only gets in Lebron's face, has a few words, and just walks away*. Like holy shit, to have the presence of mind to just *walk away* and not do something that'd get him a flagrant or a tech.||10
Keeping in mind, most likely, that another flagrant or two more technicals and he's suspended ||3
That's true, but being aware of that and backing down because of that necessarily needs him to be in control of his temper. Of course, I'd like to see him rack up less technicals and flagrants total in the next season.||1
Knowing they were going to win the game probably helped him walk away||1
I agree that probably helped a lot, but getting stepped over and teabagged... That's kind of extreme. ||1

Yeah my bad, I misspoke.  However, I do think that it is not true that "no one would blame Lebron for losing to a better team" when it seems 2-6 is always thrown out there when discussing his legacy.  |Timberwolves|-6
eh it's the peyton manning argument, is he better than tom brady because he's showed he can carry his team to the playoffs every year and get to the Super bowl, or worse because, once there, he can't then step up and refuse to lose |Knicks|2
Agreed. Same with Dan Marino and Karl Malone. I think it's silly how much championships are emphasized when judging a player's career.|Timberwolves|0
You mean one player on a team can't always win it for the other 4? Blasphemy!|Heat|1
He got mad. Is that a bad thing? You wanna talk about a total bitch, Draymond jawed at him and then ran away, basically. He made sure people were between them before he started talking. |Supersonics|-92

game was over at that point, draymond is a smart man. not gonna fall for that|Warriors|2
If he had won, this sub would have a boner about how badass he is and how he channeled his inner Jordan by being so aggressive.\n\nHe didn't really act petty, he just jawed up with players a couple times and talked trash a bit. Steph does it too, he just backs it up with his game. I'm not really the type of person to blame someone for his behavior based on if they win.\n\nIf I don't mind players doing that when they're winning, I'm not going to call them petty for doing it when losing.||-8
did you miss him fouling steph when the game was basically over and then having the nerve to jaw back? or when he tried to step over green ,green obviously taking exception and then lets green jump over him for the rebound right afterwards, there's a thin line between being pissed at losing and using that to play better, and letting it get to you, and it may be one of those things where ,we're looking at it more closely b/c he just lost in the finals instead of another game, but  it still looked REALLY bad when it seemed like the other players had calmed down *mostly* |Knicks|12
I saw all of that and I don't think it was that big of a deal. If Lebron had lead his team to a comeback everyone would be on his dick like Draymond Green. But he didn't so now we are supposed to think he's a little bitch for that? \n\nWhat I saw is 2 big bad ass motherfuckers jawing each other up at the highest level of basketball in the world. Sorry but I'm not going to call any of them bitches while I sit on my ass looking through Reddit.||-5

so did the cavs , they got their starters back |Knicks|1
I actually get it. Must be so frustrating to have gone back to Cleveland, assembled your own hand-picked team, and still fallen short in consecutive years. Any competitive person would be extremely frustrated in his situation. |Warriors|20
Especially losing the way he has 3 years in a row! |Trail Blazers|1
It is but he should be looking in the mirror , getting him and Green or Curry thrown out is not going to help the Cavs turn this around |Knicks|9
and they told me he grew up after the decision|NBA|4

As someone said, James can step over other people without retaliation, but when its a better team, that shit doesn't fly. Kudos to Green not decking him in the face. |Warriors Bandwagon|18

I don't understand this argument at all. We must be following different conversations about him. Lebron has been raked over the coals for losing finals no matter how well he's played.|Timberwolves|22

I'm mainly talking about all the Lebron fans I know. They always make up reasons when I point out that he's 2-6 in the finals.|[NBA] Dion Waiters|5

You're right. I'm a Lebron fan and make excuses for him a lot. But generally I'd say outside of us Lebron apologists people are irrationally hard on him. There's really only so much one man can do.|Timberwolves|10
I do not know about now but the last three games lebron James had almost the best stats on all fields (ppg,spg,rpg,apg,mpg) which is often unheard of. With the criticism he gets he can dunk without holding the ball, blindfolded with one leg and he still will have someone say "he could had played better"||-1
Holy shit that is funny \xf0\x9f\x98\x82|Heat|3
Yeah I've still heard people laugh at him for being swept in 2007 even tho he basically was a 1 man team that had done some crazy shit just to get to the finals. People will always hate. ||2
I've seen people blaming Lebron for assembling a team whose talents don't complement each other very well compared to GS but that itself shows most people believe GS is a better team. Lebron the player is still good, Lebron the GM needs to retire for a few years |Knicks|15
LeBron the GM has made the finals consistently. Which GM should they hire that you think would replicate that success? It hurts to see LeBron lose in the finals but this narrative that losing in the NBA championship is a sign of LeBron's inability to assemble a team is silly. |Cavaliers|1
Lebron the player made it to the finals consistently and won a couple, Lebron the GM has made it to the finals but not won any. What are you talking about to say it's been a success? Lebron has proven before he can take 4 role players to the finals, so giving him props for making the finals with 2 allstars as a GM is flustering (especially when Pat RIley showed if you paired him with all stars that weren't defensive liabilities he could win multiple rings) |Knicks|0
>  Which GM should they hire\n\nIf they want to win it all definitely Pat Riley.|Supersonics|1
Nah he should just come play for Phil :P |Knicks|3
He's basically top 5 all time in NBA Finals PTS/AST/REB and people are already defining his legacy as choking in the finals. If Lebron doesn't win the finals he will be blamed no matter how sound your logic may be.|Timberwolves|21
eh his LEGACY is definitely not gaining ground, with every finals loss, but the actual losses aren't his fault , so I don't see people claiming he's the reason the Cavs lost when he's the reason they're even in the finals again after being so bad after he left |Knicks|-1
> He's basically top 5 all time in NBA Finals PTS/AST/REB and people are already defining his legacy as choking in the finals.\n\n2 - 5 is the only one that's ever going to matter when the talk of the greatest ever comes along.\n\nAnd really, he is one clutch shot away from Ray Allen from being 1-6. Assuming they lose this series of course.|Bulls|3
Yea but saying he's not the greatest ever shouldn't be a slight on his legacy. No one says Kobe is the greatest ever and his legacy is fine\n|Knicks|2
His legacy is ever only going to be about the rings. And it may be also that he quit his team to build a superteam and barely succeeded. Quit them and built a superteam and so far hasn't succeeded.|Bulls|2
If he didn't have any rings I may agree with ya. But having 2 already puts him above some all time greats. |Knicks|1
This shit isn't doing anything for his legacy. Another year another loss isn't some awesome track record.|Timberwolves|7
Another year another Eastern Conference Championship is another way to look at it. Takes a hell of a player to win that many in a row. |Raptors|3
Can't tell if you're being sarcastic or not. Stacking your team with three all-stars and going through the weaksauce east is not an accomplishment.|Hawks|14
In a one team Eastern Conference it's impressive but not as impressive as if he did it in the West. The competition he faced is so staggeringly bad compared to the West.|Timberwolves|26
The disparity was there during the conference finals but hawks>blazers and pistons>rockets imo|Bucks|-13
I can see the Pistons beating the Rockets but IMO the Blazers were a better team than the Hawks in the playoffs. the Hawks are absolute trash in the playoffs, can't even win a single game against the Cavs. |Timberwolves|9

The LeBron hate right now is ridiculous. 24 hours ago, people were all over his dick, now it's a full on 180. r/NBA likes to rip Skip Bayless and sports media, but the truth is most people can't critically think for themselves after a game and need a pushed storyline.|Supersonics|7
Or maybe.....just mayyyyybe....when gsw wins, all the gsw fans come out to gloat....and when the cavs won, all the cavs fans came out to gloat. Shocking.|Rockets|7

Sure the loss was embarassing, but Lebron acting like a punk ass bitch was straight up disgraceful. You're repping your city, and you can't control your emotions when you're losing? That last pull on curry was completely uncalled for. |Rockets|227
That's bullshit if they had lost the game where he blocked steph's layup after that whistle last game people would be saying he's a soft ass bitch. He's doing the same thing but because he lost he's petty? |Celtics|-6
Every (good) NBA player blocks shots after the whistle. Ever since KG started that shit. It's nothing new. |[IND] Paul George|9
He lost his cool I guess. Not ok, but magnified because of who he is.\nHe's about to go 2-7 in the finals after a decade plus of being compared to guys who have 5+rings. It's gotta wear down even the strongest |Heat|4
Sorry gotta do it.  2-5 or 2 for 7|Supersonics|8
Exactly, you still have time, why the fuck was he worried about jawing and then going for two each possession...|Warriors|8
The Warriors really got to him this series |Magic|117
And they will for how ever many years LeBron has left. I don't think LeBron can get anymore rings if gsw roster stays together. I just wish he found his old Cleveland range to at least make the series watchable ||1
This is his Nam|Bulls|4
Draymond really got into his head tonight.|[LAL] Kobe Bryant|858
No he didn't lol.|Raptors|-1
Draymond gets into most everyone's head, but most players are mature enough not to bitch about it|Warriors|1
the whole warriors did, Iggy and everyone getting their strips on.\n\nanother 7 turnovers tonight.|Warriors|1
I feel like he was just trying to bait Draymond into picking up a tech or two to get suspended. The Cavs' best shot is if Draymond doesn't play.|[CLE] Kyrie Irving|2

All respect to Delly but Draymond would murder him without raising a sweat... ||0
Delly is Australian. Draymond is nothing to him.||3
Nah, Delly-Australian is completely a level (or three) below Bogut-Australian which is what would be more terrifying. Delly plays commits murders of passion - he's just all out and goes for the ball. Green? Cold-blooded killer. ||0

Probably about how salty this game tasted. |Thunder Bandwagon|18
I love the stink face Steph gave him like "dude, why are you even talking shit when you\'re down by almost double digits with less than a minute to go."|Pacers|377
For some reason I thought he said something along the lines of "Shut up you\'re just a baby back bitch". |Warriors|1
thizz face||1
Wait,  really? ||1
Imagine if you told Steph in college that one day he would be in that situation and have the upper hand. I don't think he would have believed it. Fielding shit from LeBron James because you're in his head and outplaying him in an NBA Finals game|Warriors|2
That was in reply to Lebron talking shit after Steph talked to the ref because Lebron was thrashing Curry around on the inbound pass.|Lakers|2
My money's still on LeBron in a fight tho... |NBA|9
no kidding the guy's built like a truck ||4
Yeah, but it'll be Lebron iso'ing against the entire warrior's squad. |Warriors|5
"And you\'re mad I\'m complaining to the refs? YOU Lebron James?!"|[CHI] Michael Jordan|33
Steph had the upper hand and the lead *and* the stink face. You know Lebron is gonna be in the shower reliving that confrontation over and over for years. |Warriors Bandwagon|245
ahaha yu think he has nothing better 2 do? he still has more rings then steph atm. and more money. |Clippers|-53
Gonna be fun to watch fans like you when Steph goes on to win 4 or 5 rings while Lebron sits at 2||7

If he wasn't such a whiny bitch on the court, I would feel bad for him. But he's been a hulk-pussy for years. Hard to respect it||1
I see what you mean but he's got a couple of rings, he'll be fine. I just never want Dan Gilbert to get a title. Clearly him and LeBron have worked things out but I still hold that letter against him. I don't like how he put the team in different uniforms once James left, as if the previous (and much nicer ones) were for the Cleveland LeBrons not the Cleveland Cavaliers. I didn't like the message it sent to the rest of the team. And now they (the road maroon uniforms) look like a semi-pro team from a 70's movie about basketball. Maybe it's silly but it I don't like it.\n\nedit: (the road maroon uniforms)||2
Perhaps you have forgotten what an arrogant prick he was in Miami and talking about how many finals he was going to win in a row? Or when he quit on his team vs Dallas in the finals or even tonight when he scores 4 points in the first half or vs the Spurs when he is getting crushed in a series and walks around in post games saying "I am still the best player in the world that is why I am confident we can win this" Sorry if Lebron is going to act like the best he needs to prove it not act like a bitch every time a call goes against him and disappear for entire halves of finals games.||26
Ok the only legit point you make was quitting vs Dallas. All the other points ARE what the best ever would do and say. How many coaches how many players have you heard say they're gonna win it all? That's a dumb argument. ||-7
Thanks for reminding me of all the reasons I hate LeBron. Meanwhile, people hate curry because he chews on his mouthpiece. |76ers|3
I felt that way about his 2007 loss. He's obviously a great player, but he's done this to himself. Predicts a million titles in Miami. Bounces when Wade and Bosh start slowing down. Forms another super team with younger players. Hand picks his teammates and coach. Not to mention his phases of insane arrogance. I can't feel sorry for him. ||23
I miss his first year in Miami. The Cavs fucked Lebron with all those over the hill vets and that short term over the cap situation. I know this is cleveland so not many big players want to come here but the cavs had plenty of time to trade /sign a great one while they were ECF and Finals contender with years left on James contract. \n\nHughes, Mo will, and Boobie Gibs were never good enough prospect and Jamison, O'neal and Marshall were never good enought 2nd options. \n\nAd to this the cap space and it was a dead end not worth saving. \n\nFirst year in MIA, he really had this chip on his shoulder like some Marvel/CD villain. HE WAS crushing everyone. 1 min he is swatting a guard, the next rebounding over a star rebounder and that fast break was automatic. \n\nI really wish he had won it over Dallas to see this true villain persona grow. \nI bet there would not be LeBron triple doubles, just full triple doubles and then sharing selfless extra passes.\n\nAs for MIA, some say he came in to learn the championship mentality and was already set on finishing his career in Cleveland.\n\nHe is childish but the villain in him goes very well with the media criticism he gets no matter what he does.\n|[TOR] Pops Mensah-Bonsu|1

I think I saw LeBron (on the replay where we can see Stephs face clearly and the side of Lebrons) say "you\'re soft" and steph said something like "get outta here man"|Timberwolves|135
"Get outta here man"\n\nThat\'s when you know they\'re right but have to say something back for pride ||-14
I bet everyone in the league hates Steph so much.  All he does is embarrass fools, and he doesn't give a shit about their shit talking.||1
This is actually the most reasonable guess I've heard about what they were saying now that I think about what led to the confrontation.|Warriors|1
To me it looked like he said "stop acting soft"||4
So soft that he scored 38 and they have a 3-1 series lead. \n\n|Kings|20
I loveed when everyone started chanting "Draymond sucks". He thrives on that kinda thing. It was no surprise when he hulked out right after and started blocking the shit out of everything LeBron came at him with.||437
he definitely doesnt thrive on that kind of thing. remember okc? fans got in his head |Suns|-5
Yeah, I don't know what people are thinking. He was hot garbage (-73!) in the first two games at OKC when people were booing him.|[OKC] Kendrick Perkins|4
Because it not happening 2 times completely negates the dozens of other times it's happened over the years involving both the crowed and/or players. Yup. Or the fact that his own friends, team mates, coaches, even his own mother have all said he thrives on it. Nope. if it's not 100% it's 0%.\n\nHere's an [article](http://www.wsj.com/articles/everybody-loves-trash-talking-draymond-1462218027) from last month.

That\xe2\x80\x99s why the Warriors don\xe2\x80\x99t wait for other teams to engage Green. They trash-talk their own teammate. ||1

I don\'t care whether people think this is "playoff basketball", the standard of refereeing is awful. JVG said it well, it\'s not letting them play, it\'s just not calling fouls. It makes it hard for me to enjoy the game.\n\nAt least they don\'t seem to be favoring a specific team. But it\'s a problem.\n|[SAS] Rasual Butler|1193
Honest question: Do the same refs referee each game for the playoffs? I noticed this game was especially bad for non calls.\n\n I know it would be hard to do, but if it was the same crew each time at least it would be consistent and the players would know what to expect.|Trail Blazers|5
Nope all different. So far there hasn't been a single repeat ref in these finals either.||2
Its not the same crew. There will be a post on here saying who the game 5 refs are and I would not expect to see any of tonight's refs in that post|[MIL] Andrew Bogut|3

Wasn't as big of a problem as everyone's trying to make it out to be.|[LAL] Kobe Bryant|11
I'll agree it was fairly even both ways, I still think not calling fouls benefits the worse team though.|Rockets|6
LeBron got away with bloody murder.\n\nEdit: LeBron's stepover would have been a technical if Green did it.\n\nLeBron smacks Iguodala's hand and there's no call.\n\nLeBron flails his elbows and hits Livingston in the face.. No call. Smh.||32
Lmao Draymond fell to the ground trying to draw his 7th BS foul of the game and Lebron was just sick of it. No problem with that step over even if Lebron did play like shit|Cavaliers|-17
Draymond has kicked three people and tried to rip another players arm out of its socket since his last technical. \n\nBut yeah, a *step over* is what gets him a technical. |Cavaliers|-9

The contact is awesome. Throwback to the Bad Boys and the rest of the league back then!\n\nIt feels excessive because the refs call so much ticky-tacky shit in the regular season. \n\nIt's mostly disappointing to me because it is totally different than how they have called the rest of the season. Shit... LeBron had an offensive foul and they called it on Reggie Jackson in the first round... The difference in foul calling is a pretty extreme. |Pistons|0
I hated it, completely took away Cleveland's game, pushing it hard into the paint.  GSW makes shots give them credit, but this just made the game boring to watch because you knew Cleveland already gave up.  They switched to taking jumpers because they knew they would get hacked bringing it inside.|Celtics|1
Agreed, just like pick up |Rockets|1
watching this game was like watching an episode of Daredevil.|Warriors|1
It was fantastic. I wish most games were officiated like this. Let some light pushing and elbows go|Lakers|1
I would have liked it if they kept it more consistent. Early in the game they didn't let them get away with a lot, then just started slacking off more and more as the game went on. As a player that would be infuriating because you start doubting yourself as to what you can and can't do||2
Maybe the first half. Then it was just like "what\'s the point of having the dudes in grey anyway?"the Draymond/LeBron thing happened while the ref was staring at them and literally running towards them. They\'re lucky they didn\'t get in a fight the first time around. |NBA|2
It had no flow. One call on one end is not called on the other the next play, the next quarter an even more blatant foul is brushed under and a ticky tacky call is made on the other end like wtf where is the consistency.|Timberwolves|2
I don't disagree, but I still loved it. They should change the rules to be more lenient when it comes to fouls.|Bulls|3
Agreed, I long for physical play in the NBA.|Pistons|7
Yeah, I do like the physical aspect. When referees call every little contact you get more flops. It's a lot harder to flop when you are allowed to play physical.|Raptors|3
> It\'s a lot harder to flop when you are allowed to play physical.\n\nExcept we saw the exact opposite happen this game. The announcers were giving Varejao shit for his "flop," but the fact of the matter is he probably wouldn\'t have gotten the call (which the guy they brought in for analysis said should have been a foul) if he didn\'t sell Love\'s push.\n\nIf less contact is allowed, its much easier for refs to see if people actually made contact or if someone\'s just pretending something happened.|Warriors|3
I loved it, but the referees were still awful on the calls they did make.|Nets|4
I\'m with x-man, I don\'t give a fuck about either of these teams, but I think fans, "NBA" fans, deserve better basketball than what we saw tonight as a result of the officiating. It was a shit show man.\n\nMy girlfriend who doesn\'t know dick about basketball/sports said it best tonight: "Why are we still watching this sweaty man pileup?"|Thunder Bandwagon|42
I agree, I think it should be consistent, especially throughout a series.  I wonder if they lowkey tell the teams before each game or series "we\'re calling this tight" or "we\'re calling this game loose"...or if they just have to wait to see how the calls are.  But then when you get used to it, they just switch up in the middle of the game anyways.\n\nBut "letting them play" as the commentators will say all weekend is what people have been wanting because of the perception that low physicality in the modern NBA is favoring GS.  Some people think the NBA gave referees whistles for the first time in 2002, so this game is to show that the outcome is not all that different.|Magic|2
Right there with you. Great physical basketball. Calls were missed on both sides but for the most part, the refs allowed tough play.|Lakers|9
Typically I would be more likely to agree with you but, this game seemed to go overboard with bad non-calls that favored Cleveland for about 3 quarters and then GSW in the 4th. Very weird and annoying.|NBA|225
Favored Cleveland? Ahahahahahahahahahahahahah. Were you watching the first quarter when they called 4 fouls for GS on plays where they weren't touched?||-6
Or did you see the plays where gs was definently fouled and they missed it.||4
Like what? The last play of the quarter on the play that they never call? They missed a lot more that should have gone clevelands way. ||1
I like free-flowing basketball, but it just seems a bit much to me. I agree with a bit of leniency on ticky-tacky fouls, but I'm talking about a lot of obvious fouls that just aren't being called.\n\nThere's a fine line between free-flowing and dangerous due to a lack of refereeing. I dunno if we'll get to dangerous, but the referees are letting people get away with too much, in my opinion.|[SAS] Rasual Butler|23
When it gets too free flowing it gets less free flowing because defenses can use physicality to slow the game down too much.|Wizards|1
> I dunno if we'll get to dangerous\n\nHonestly, I totally feel like how aggressive Lebron and Draymond were able to be towards each other was entirely on the refs, and that was nearly a fight. Seems like that's inching very close to dangerous.|Warriors|2
Agreed. Reminds me of the blacktop days where we were fouling every possession, but too prideful to call anything. |[CLE] LeBron James|42

For real. I didn't enjoy watching any part of this game. Jus threw my hands up in disbelief the whole time. I want to love the finals but I can't.|Nuggets|25
Im divided. I love that they bite there whistles at times but other times its just ridiculous. Kevin love blatantly pushes verajoe, lebron gets hacked, iggy gets hacked, everyone getting held. I like biting the whistle if it's barley a foul, but if you cross a certain line its gotta be called. NBA needs more refs. A ref at each baseline permanently, and a replay ref.||1
I enjoyed the game, but some of the shit they were allowing was dangerous and it seemed it just kept escalating. Glad no one got hurt. |Warriors|13
was a lot of fun to watch, and the better team won. i liked it a lot||1
Yeah, there was a stretch in the 3rd where I was honestly wondering if the refs had lost their whistles. Both teams kept escalating the contact, and still nothing. The players committing the would-be-fouls even looked shocked when they weren't called. Guys would steal the ball, look around for the whistle, and then play on, incredulous.|[GSW] Chris Mullin|15
The problem isn't even missing calls.  It's calling certain things tight and then missing the calls.  The players need some expectation for how the game is going to be called, and in this game the refs were calling tickytack shit and not calling harder fouls.  You simply can't have that.\n\nAlso, can someone explain how that Bogut alley-oop wasn't a shooting foul?  I don't understand how that was a possible outcome in that situation.  Like, the NBA refereeing processes should not have allowed that.  It was called a foul, on a very clear alley-oop interrupted by the called foul, but then wasn't calling a shooting foul.  That's breaking process.|Pistons|18
was the ball below the rim? it looked like it was thrown below the rim and he was reaching to get to it from an angle but i don't remember||1
> Also, can someone explain how that Bogut alley-oop wasn't a shooting foul?\n\nThought the same thing - it's clearly an attempt to score, that would have had a high percentage of being made without the foul. How then is it not a shooting foul?|Warriors|1
You have to have possession of the ball for it to be a shooting foul. |Nuggets|3
"It\'s not calling fouls."\n\nKevin Live obviously fouls Andy:\n\n"That\'s a flop! You can\'t call fouls for a flopper!"||324
yeah in what universe was that a flop by anderson|NBA|1
Yeah. I really like JVG but I lost some respect for him tonight with his over reactions and straight up hypocrisy. One moment claiming fouls should\'ve be called if the guy exaggerates the contact, even though he was clearly fouled. Minutes later he\'s excusing tough fouls go because it\'s "crunch time" JVG is usually pretty thoughtful in his commentary but he was all over the place tonight. \n\nThe refs were awful tonight though nom both sides. In the first half I was livid at the calls the Warriors were not getting. The second half flipped and the calls went against Cleveland. It\'s just so frustrating. ||5
> Kevin Live \n\nActually that was Kevin tape-Delay|West|3
K Love obviously pushed Andy. There's no benefit for Andy to not fall down.|Vancouver Grizzlies|5
I thought that was one of the most ridiculous and biased things I've heard a commentator say...\n\nHe clearly pushed him down. It's not a foul just because he has a history? That's not how it works.||275
i dunno it should work that way though, there should be some in game punishment for it like "hmm maybe you were fouled but you flop a lot so i\'m not sure if you flopped this time" \n\n(i mean if you saw the play and it wasn\'t a flop obviously call the foul)||-17
Exactly.  If a guy has a history of flopping you no longer get the benefit of the doubt.  It would cut that flopping garbage right out.  ||-8
And worst case it's a missed call and you can award the player $5000 for it||-2
He definitely didn't have the force to push him down.. You can give someone a nudge or even exert SOME force against a person without them falling over. Is Love supposed to just let him freely walk around under the basket without even laying a hand on him? ||-2
He literally tackled him. ||1
Jvg and mjax are both extremely anti warriors. It's frustrating to constantly have to listen to their bullshit|Warriors|5
He's been like that for the last two finals. Him and MJax are idiots. |Warriors|27
He also said "Lebron needs to shoot more 3\'s and jumpers in order to win" Might be better off just watching these games on mute to be honest I about fell out of my chair when he said that, the guy is struggling to score from 10 feet away and you want to move him out of his comfort zone?||9
Your point is valid but I think you misunderstand his. We're talking about someone people consider to be the best player of all time. Or one of them. You can't be that guy taking it to the basket and being mauled and having the ball turnover. You need to be quadruple threat. You need to be able to dunk, stop and take a mid-range shot, hit a 3 or pass it to the guy who is open now that you've been double-teamed. All of the greats can do all four of those and LeBron can barely do 2 of them. And more importantly, having a consistent jumper makes it very easy to dunk as the defender must play you closer. Look at how they play Curry. They double team him from 30 feet away. ||1
He actually said "LeBron needs to take and make" those outside shots. The secret this whole time is that LeBron just needs to start making shots! How did LeBron and Lue not notice this yet? \n\nI usually love JVG but he\'s been off this series.|NBA|8
Yeah him and Jackson were kind of rough which one ripped into varajo for getting ran over and they said he was flopping?||1
He got called out on it by the other commentator.\n\nYou could hear it in his voice that he knew he was wrong. Anyone with an ego doubles down in that situation though so he didn't recant.||19
>anyone with an ego doubles down in that situation\n\nOh God he is Trump I didn't realize it.||4
Trump didn't invent that style, egocentric people have been around since beginning of time.||5
Watching Varejao has been fascinating for me. A bad flopper will feel contact and then embellish the reaction. A good flopper, and Varejao is a very good flopper, anticipates when contact is about to be made, and sets himself up to flop so it looks like a natural reaction.\n\nIn that play, he knows Kevin Love is going to push him. He could have stood his ground there, you just take that extra stabalizing step when you\'re pushed. But he decides early "when Love pushes me I\'m gonna fall", so you see his (I don\'t remember, left or right) foot kind of freeze and not move, so his body just falls over naturally without that foot placed in a stabilizing position.\n\nFrom Love\'s perspective, he\'s thinking "I\'m gonna push Varejao just a little bit to move him out of the way to clear the lane." Maybe he should realize Varejao is gonna flop on the play, but he doesn\'t, so you see Love also falls on the play too, he wasn\'t expecting Varejao to fall over when he pushes him. And then he gets mad when the foul is called, "I barely touched him!". Well true, but you did touch him, you clearly pushed him. Varejao is simply thinking one step ahead of his opponent to draw the foul. \n\nNow what I would love to see is for the "fouler" to realize he is being guarded by Varejao, and in those situations where it is normal to put a little contact on the player, just lay off completely. Like if I were Kevin Love during that play, I would move towards Varejao making it seem like I\'m about to push him, but at the last second lay off completely and not touch him at all. I don\'t know if that happens ever, but it would be interesting to see what Varejao does in that situation. Does he flop? Does he freeze up and do nothing? Does he roll with it and use the space to make a move? Because it seems like Varejao commits so early in the play to flopping, I don\'t know if he can cancel it on the fly if his man were to try to fake the contact.|Raptors|32
Haha damn that's so cool man. I never actually thought about flopping as sort of an art form. Just a shitty terrible looking thing to do. Now I'm almost paranoid, thinking people who don't even look like they're flopping are actually flopping. I'm torn now because half of me also believes Varejao needs an Oscar now... \n\nEdit: speeling||1
that was totally a foul, van gundy was holding varejo's rep to a higher degree than the actual play.  varejo has always been a flopper, but in that play in particular he was clearly pushed by love|[POR] Damian Lillard|42
Lebron chooses to pad his stats with layups instead of working for 3s to end the game.|Warriors|206
I mean you're not going to drop four 3s in a minute. Especially not Lebron or Frye. Stats say you take the layups there and hope for a stupid and 1 and missed warriors free throws. Asking people shooting 30% to rain 3s in a pressure situation isn't smart.||1
I agree with you in a sense but .3*.3*.3*.3 is still > 0. I mean there was no way they could've caught up with drives.|[GSW] Shaun Livingston|2
This made absolutely no sense whatsoever. You're in a position where only quick threes can potentially get you back in the game, but no, LeBron just doesn't believe in math I guess. |Warriors|19
Actually he does if he pads his stats his fans will use it to defend him and act like he got no help like they always do.||3
The only math Lebron believes in is statistics.|Lakers|22
lbj has always chased stats.||33
Probably has himself on all the fantasy teams :D||5
he's a notorious stat watcher. surprised he didn't go for an assist to get the triple double.|Timberwolves|13
Yeah, what the hell was that? They desperately needed three pointers and instead he kept getting easy layups...which is exactly what the warriors wanted with curry and klay on the floor. It would be a long shot, but that game was still winnable.||74
"I\'m not sure about what 3 there were alot of them"\n\n\nDam Klay such shade lol |West|16

First time in his career I've seen Lebron 'crack' like this.  Just the other day he was giving a post game interview and everyone was praising how much he's matured since coming into the league.  Then you have a game like this where he seemed to lose it mentally.  \n\n\nHe's playing the team game.  Letting his teammates take shots.  There was a time when we'd see him takeover.. demand the ball.. put it all on his shoulders.  He's not doing that anymore.  I'd like to think he's just staying committed to playing team basketball.  Although part of me thinks he's just not that good anymore to take over and drop 45 on people.  ||61
>Although part of me thinks he's just not that good anymore to take over and drop 45 on people.\n\nHe sealed the deal playing the game his way, playing the team game, 27/11/11/3/3, but not before dropping 40+ back to back. I hope that part of you has learned better :P|[MIA] Dwyane Wade|0
Dyed in the wool LeBron hater here, but I think he\'s partially doing it to call attention to his team\'s inadequacies like "look at the useless pricks they make me play with." At least that totally fits with the way he gave up on Miami in his last finals series there too. I love this sulky shit, it vindicates my otherwise irrational hatred. |NBA|0
You didn't see the finals vs the Mavs???|[GSW] Draymond Green|6
He just checked out that series. This series you can see it getting to him.|76ers|6
You don't remember in Cleveland when he started shooting freethrows left handed because of an injury that no one would confirm?|[LAL] Mark Madsen|4
his jumper isn't consistent enough to do that. It started declining in the last year in Miami and we are seeing the aftereffects now.\n|Celtics|18
How does that work? He had a 30% jumper for years. Loses to the mavs with Miami, gets into the paint, beats OKC, then vs the Spurs, his jumper showed up. Now, 2 years in a row it's gotten worse.\nDoes he just not practice that? Defenses getting smarter?|Heat|6
I think his form is terrible so he has to shoot a ton to be decent with it. Since he's committed to the paint post 2011 besides that run in 2013 playoffs he's never shot well.\n\n||6
The way the Cavs played in the first half, I thought they were going to run away with another one and make this a best-of-three series for the championship. But Golden State completely turned the tables on that idea - or, I think more accurately - the Cavs turned them on themselves. Cleveland\xe2\x80\x99s offense stagnated in the second half - especially in the 4th, where it seemed like there was zero ball/off-ball player movement, and A LOT of ISO plays for Kyrie and Bron (reminded me of the playoff Raptors in certain stages- I was left wondering, does this team even run plays?). This was all evidenced by the fact that at one point in the 4th, the Cavs went without a FG for almost seven minutes. Hard to beat a team of GS\xe2\x80\x99s calibre when that happens, whether at home or not. \n\nBelieve it or not, Cavs actually shot a higher percentage than GS in the second half, but they lost because of that cold stretch and that they only made one three pointer after half (compared to ~8 for GS). The fact the Warriors set an NBA-finals record with 17 3PM hurt Cleveland as well.\n\nAnyway, I was hoping Cleveland would win this one so that we would be *guaranteed* to delay the start of the offseason a bit longer. But I think now the repeat is pretty much a done deal (considering how hard GS is to beat at home, and that no team has ever recovered from a 3-1 deficit in the NBA finals). Nice to finally watch a competitive Finals game, though. The previous three games were complete duds (from a neutral fan\xe2\x80\x99s view) but at least this one was watchable and competitive through the 4th q - basically all I was hoping for at this point!\n\nEdit: added sentence about Warriors setting NBA Finals single game 3PM team record.|Raptors|349
Try posting this in the next day game thread too! Some people avoid post game threads because they don't like the memes and over reactions. I love your analysis.|Spurs|2
Thank you!|Raptors|2
Man why does this sub refuse to give the dubs credit? Their defense and adjustments won the game. But let's keep blaming Cleveland ||2
Ball movement in the 2nd half really took the air out of the offense.  At least Kyrie was the only one showing some heart and getting buckets.  But Lebron's 6 turnovers, and GS defense on him was the story of the half.  But that ball movement compared to GS....|Thunder Bandwagon|2
my money is always on Dubs if it's going close heading to the 4th quarter... in any game.\n\nThey just had to keep it close til then. Lebron, Kyrie and co were predictably going to get gassed and start hero ball. It was just a matter of Warriors continuing what they were doing defensively and securing rebounds which got easier with TT off the floor.|Warriors|3
You\'re absolutely right. They were so static in the fourth quarter. It was stunning to watch. I\'m not an expert on the XOs side of basketball, but you could just see the difference. The Warriors were lively and animated on every possession. Constant screens, movement, and passes. The Cavs just sunk into Kyrie and Lebron saying, "I\'m going to beat my man and score on my own" on every possession. They seemed to totally lose faith in playing team basketball and it killed them. |Warriors|3
How can you blame Kyrie's isos though, it was the only source of points on that team. |Lakers|18
Yeah a few of these game's he's been less than stellar, but tonight he was the main reason the game even was a game. |Warriors|3

I feel like the Warriors are the most mentally tough team in the league. You can look at the Western Conference Finals as example A, but even in tonight's game they showed resolve and played hard and *smart* through the fourth, even while the Cavaliers were playing amazing basketball. \n|Spurs|92
Which is a clear sign of great vs poor coaching. Good teams trust the system in place during crunch time, and more importantly, each other. \n\nThe 2nd half of this game is a clear indication why Tyron Lue is a poor coach|Celtics|1
Lot of stats out there show they very very rarely lose close games because of how clutch they are in the 4th. |Lakers|1
Happens when you have great coaching, everyone buys into the system, and everyone trusts each other. Also helps when you have guys like Livingston and Iguodala (former #1 scoring option) coming off the bench. The most complete team I think we will ever see. A complete perfect storm of good drafting and acquisitions as well as players taking less to play.|Cavaliers|3
I mean, you have to be pretty damn mentally tough to win 73 freaking games.|Heat|5
That's because about 70% of their wins they were down by 8-12 at one point. It's basically their game plan at this point. |Pistons|4
I mean if it works who cares right?|Warriors|1
During the OKC series, GS just kept taking haymaker after haymaker, but they never deviated from the game plan, along with a bit of luck.|NBA|20
There's no shame in losing to the Warriors, but the Cavs gave this game away. They went to iso ball in the 4th when Kyrie and Lebron were exhausted, which makes no sense. Kerr got his guys rest, even when it meant playing poor options, and it worked out in crunch time. Cavs had to win this one and they blew it, so frustrating. |Cavaliers|295
[deleted]||1
Warriors, OKC, Spurs, Nuggets, Cavs?|Warriors|5
The game was right there to be stolen...I thought that LeBron would have gotten his regular rest at the start of the 4th...but he was not being aggressive the whole game and that was what frustrated me. The Cavs let this one go.|[CLE] LeBron James|1
Yea, LeBron was really looking to facilitate this game, way more than usual. For 3 quarters he barely attacked, I'm not sure what's going on.|Raptors|3
It was a weird game from him...every single time he got into the paint he was looking to pass. I get that is what he does, he facilitates more, but he needed to be a little stingy this game, even thought that is not how he plays...just an odd (and frustrating) game to watch.|[CLE] LeBron James|1
And wtf was that at the end? All they did was just go for 2's when down by 9 with minimal time left. Not a single attempted 3 in that stretch. What were they doing/thinking?|Raptors|2
I just don't know...they were exchanging 2s for free throws...hell if you miss the 3s atleast you are taking them...smh...that was just a weird game...|[CLE] LeBron James|1
And like it's fine playing the free throw game but they were doing nothing to try and stop Steph or Klay from getting the inbound pass. It looks like they just gave up with like 3 minutes left in the game.|Raptors|2
I definitely didn't look like to me...once Golden state had that 8-0 run to take the lead, it looks they were defeated.|[CLE] LeBron James|1
Did they really give the game away though. That's just ignorant. The Cavs had no significant lead in the fourth like OKC did in game 6 of the WCF. |Celtics|1
They didn't give this game away. The Warriors took this game from them...with their defense. They forced Cleveland to resort to iso ball. And the Warriors made shots when they needed to, the Cavs missed their shots.||1
This is what comes of letting Lebron be the coach and GM. When you need greatness from those positions you're screwed. ||5
Lol @ "poor options", on a 73-9 team. The Warriors are better, period.||6
I don't think he means that our bench is bad per se, but when some of these players are up against LeBron James, it seems like a poor option maybe? The Warriors has the luxury of being able to stave off the Cavs when their bench came into play and this gave the starters valuable rest time to close out. |Warriors|3
When he put in Macadoo in the first I knew we were gonna ball out in the 4th.|Warriors|3
It's easy to talk about iso, which you're right but the defensive lapses in the third was just as bad as the offense in the fourth. |Raptors|3
You're right but given the Cavs personnel and the Warriors historically good offense, there isn't a lot Lue can do about that now. IMO there were things he could have done to fix the offense (get his guys some rest, use better rotations, put a stop to the hero ball, etc.). The Cavs have the guys to play good offense, and yeah it would be tough against GS, but Lue clearly needed to try something else.|Cavaliers|1
Oh no, there were obvious defensive breakdowns on the Cavs part. It's not about a game plan, it's leaving players open on broken and set plays. \n\nThe three by Klay was the most obvious play. It's the one JVG called it out too. \n\nIt's not really about Lue, just the team having a bad second half - defensively in the third and then overcompensating it with bad offense in the fourth. It happens, just bad timing.|Raptors|3
Honestly, Cleveland's depth is a lot worse than ours. That's a big factor. Lue can't really go to the bench because there's nothing there, whereas the Dubs have great backup options. Golden State's depth is phenomenal and has been one of our biggest edges over OKC and Cleveland. |Warriors|5
I mean that's what happens against the Warriors. We did it too. Warriors play stupid hard D in the 4th forcing you to go ISO. Of course it's partly Kyrie and Lebron's fault for going ISO glory mode but I think the Warriors have a hand in it too. I mean we lost 3 in a row because we were forced to ISO. I might be wrong but that's what I believe.|[OKC] Russell Westbrook|16
That's true to an extent, but there were a ton of possessions where Irving and Lebron walked up with blinders on. They were either putting their heads down to drive or taking a bad shot with 15-18 seconds left on the shot clock. A lot of the time the Warriors didn't even really need to play defense, just clog the lane and wait. And after it clearly didn't work for 5-6 minutes of game time, Lue still didn't change anything.|Cavaliers|0
I mean props to Golden State for their D too. Cavs could've played better but they only had a 2 point lead in one point in the 4th|Kings|92
They went 6 mins w/o a single point.||4
And we're still only down like 7 at that point with 3 minutes left. They completely fucked themselves with isolated ball|Lakers|3
JVG or Jackson pointed it out at the start of the 4th. Both Lebron and Kyrie were in, while Curry was getting rest.|NBA|37
First thing cavs did after losing was go in the locker room and watch replays of bron getting hit in the nuts?\n|Lakers|15

His jersey burns surprisingly quickly after it first ignites.|Nuggets|2
Anyone know why he was in for so long?|Celtics|3
Any Cav fan that blames Love is stupid. He played hard but this series is just not good match up wise at all. |Cavaliers|14
Exactly. He wanted to come back Game 3 as well, he's definitely putting the effort in, it's just a bad stylistic matchup for him|[NYK] J.R. Smith|1
Not his fault his only job in cleveland is to camp at the 3 point line lol|Celtics|25

Well, if losing made Cleveland fans quit, the city would have been deserted years ago.|Warriors|1
Are we supposed to congratulate them for that?||1
I am sure most thought it was going to be the last time they saw their team at home this year. So, they made the best of it. ||1
It was also kiiiind of close at times in the last two minutes.  Enough that they didn't want to be the 2013 Heat fans.|[CHI] Michael Jordan|1
Because it might be the last time they see Lebron|Thunder Bandwagon|1
True respect goes out to them for sure. |Warriors|1
Yeah but why spread truth when we can lie? |[GSW] Ian Clark|1
I found it funny when Oracle had more people watching in Oakland than the Cavs had left in their stadium. Then they panned to the  outside view, and they all were there.|76ers|19
It's the only one us poorer fans can afford. Those tickets at Oracle were $25 for lower level compared to $480+ tickets for when they play at home. |Warriors|1
That's pretty cool, I love your fan base. The only one who can legit say they stuck through the tough times.|76ers|1

So wait... this is now good? I thought the original argument was that terrible fans leave early?\n\nIs there an exception to this rule in the event that the team is winning? That seems counter intuitive given the original statement. \n\nPlease explain this to me, all knowing sage of basketball fandom.||2
cavs fans left early last game|Warriors|4
Was expecting Heat fans part two. Props Cavs fans!||55
I mean what elese are you gonna do in Cleveland?||-1
Everyone in Cleveland is shocked and appalled by this amazing new insult you just created.||3
Well we ran out of new insults for Cleveland for the last half century||0
They love the misery, it's home to them.|Heat|3
Heat fans part two got a championship. Part three, as well.||9
they left early last year but thats none of my business |Heat|27
I'm a supplanted Heat fan living in the Philly area. Philly fans leave every single game early. Except the Flyers fans.\n\nEvery fanbase has fans that leave early. |Heat|9
he's saying they never got into the game. i.e. sitting down all game.|Warriors|6
Oh no, they were standing and complaining every time Lebron missed... You see that guy flex after Steph (?) missed? ||1
My section in the nosebleeds we stood the whole game |Cavaliers|2
Some of them look like they haven't left their seat in years |Hawks|30
Ths Cavs team is a pale imitation of the 2010-14 Heat.|Heat|39
I just don't get the fourth quarter collapse ||6
Miami played championship defense when it needed to. The Cavs have too many dudes who are straight up defensive liabilities.|Heat|26
Just got word that Lue will bench LeBron after he gave him Vietnam-level PTSD with that step over Dray |Warriors|13

Didn't mean to sound like a dick, but after game 4 I would have never put my money on the Cavs. Then the suspension thing happened and all was downhill from there.|Warriors|1

Regardless of we were rooting for tonight, I think we can all agree on one thing. \n\n**The refs were absolute trash tonight.**\n\nIt's one thing to call tick tacky fouls or to let the guys play, but it's another to be so incredibly inconsistent that no one playing in or watching the game knows what is or isn't going to draw a whistle. \n\nI'm not passing blame at all, I just feel like games at this stage of the NBA season deserve better officiating than what we received tonight. |[DAL] Dirk Nowitzki|307
Honestly, with the way Lebron was driving the basket all game I'm surprised he didn't get more foul calls. Like 4 FTA?!?|[GSW] Baron Davis|0
Iggy throws the ball out. Ball GS. And the ref that called it was 2 steps away from it. I thought I was blind before the replay.||-5
Smith goes right across Iggy's arms on the 3 pointer. No call, tech on Kerr.|[GSW] Larry McNeill|9
tech on Luke|[GSW] Baron Davis|3
Yeah this foul was also a clear one. But tbh the tech on Kerr was probably the only time the refs tried to get control of the game/calm down someone on the field.\n||3
If ya'll had these refs Dirk would have 2 rings.  You know if this was 06, Cleveland would've been living at the foul line.  Dwade got every one of those calls vs. the Mavs.|Celtics|1
I was really annoyed at the way the game was called tonight.  It seemed like they everything go.  There were plays throughout the game that had been called as fouls in previous games, and suddenly the refs swallowed their whistles.  Strange.|Kings|1
The fouls are one thing, but the out of bounds call being missed is inexcusable. They need to get better at utilizing replay.||1
That out of bounds call on Iggy was BAD. Clearly it went out on Iggy.|Heat|3
What about the foul right before half time? It was bad, but equally bad for both sides. ||14
Oh yea that one was bad as well, but those are rarely ever called. |Heat|-5
Yeah I can understand if fouls aren't being called on both ends, but getting simple calls like that blatantly wrong is pretty bad.|[CLE] James Jones|3
Yeah but in both cases a ref was RIGHT there and missed it.|Warriors|5
Or that breakaway wear bron swatted Iggy's forearm and the reft said he only knocked it out. The ref was right there.||3
>deserve better officiating \nLol|Hornets|2
I actually thought it was consistent and they were letting more go than I've ever seen before. I hate that shit, that's not what I personally want to see in basketball.|Supersonics|3
Amen|Minneapolis Lakers|8
We need a ref lowlight video. It was atrocious.|Warriors|6
For real. Not calling fouls is just bad officiating. Ugh. So ugly.|Heat|6
The officiating was fucking unacceptable. It's not like it's going to change. They kind of do what they want. |Knicks|81

Anybody notice how the Cavs kinda gave up around the 6 minute mark in the fourth? That was weird. Crowd wasn't in it, players looked very uninterested... Just odd cuz they were only down 5.|Trail Blazers|11
Dead legs. No rest. Lue's fault.|Warriors|6
Its kinda hard though. You're going to put Cavs bench against Warriors bench? Warriors bench could make a decent team by themselves.|Warriors|2
This game shows clearly that Lebron cares more about stats padding than winning. Down 9 with 30 seconds left? Better go for the easy 2!|Lakers|71
The whole team already gave up by then|Timberwolves|1
Implying LeBron can make clutch 3's in the finals. |Wizards|18
According to JVG he needs to shoot more of them, wish I could get paid to say crap like that.||3
Even worse he said he need so take and make those. Who knew all along lebron just needed to make his shots.|[LAL] Kobe Bryant|3
Barnes earned himself a max, tonight.|Warriors|60
Save for maybe a game or two I think he's been the most consistent player on this squad. Sure he doesn't get the volume or run the offense like Steph, Klay or Dray, but when he needs to make a bucket he does it. The realist in me tells me he's not worth giving a max to but damn it if I don't want GS to keep him. |Warriors|-1
So. Does Barnes still deserve a max? Is he definitely worthy of it? Dumbass, don't fucking overreact next time. He's nothing close to the max smh.|Celtics|1
For sure||1
Came here to laugh. Hahaha.|Cavaliers|2
About that...|Cavaliers|2

I'm not blind to all the dirty shit, but when the dude is on your team it's really hard to dislike him because he fucking hates losing.|Warriors|6
Every team needs an asshole and he's Golden States. He doesn't give a fuck if you like him, he doesn't give a fuck if the crowd likes him, he doesn't give a flying fuck. He only cared about his team winning and that's why he's invualable, he won't let anyone walk over him and he'll foul you and piss you off to no end as long as it means winning. Dude may not be a sportsman but by God he's got the drive to win and amazing athleticism and that's why even if you don't like him you gotta respect him. This is a guy who won't even back down to LeBron, Draymond does not give a fuck and it's amazing. \n\n\n\n\nPlus he looks like a donkey. ||12
I watched him all season and never felt he was exceedingly dirty. The Adams thing was embarrassing, but honestly he didn't do stuff like that every night. He's mostly just a guy who plays with great passion, hustle, and intensity. Guys like this are frustrating to play against, but you love them when they're on your team. |Warriors|23
He's definitely a guy that you want on your team. He's a pure heart, energy guy. My only complaint would be that he set some shady screens this year. However, if you're continually getting away with it, why stop?|Raptors|11
You\'re a brave man contradicting r/NBA\'s hive-mind. I\'d be willing to bet that within 20 minutes, there will be at least three "Fuck Draymond Green" comments.  |Raptors|246
The hive mind is all for him now. Just the other day it was Fuck him for going at nuts and he does it and he's the hero now? Fuck out of here. Regardless of what LeBron was doing. That was the same as throwing a punch.|[CLE] Delonte West|-12
youre gonna be bloated with water retention being filled with all that salt|Warriors|5
He's not contradicting at all. The hive mind is your comment. That's why you're all up voted |Raptors|0
I'm with him in solidarity. Although I've already loved Dray.|Warriors|1
I still hate him so there |Rockets|1
He's that player you absolutely hate playing against your team but would love to have. |Bulls|1
Nah man, you missed the tide turning. That was last week's /r/NBA.|Bulls|12
I just can't seem to keep up with the trends|Raptors|6
keeping up with the trends is so 20 minutes ago...|Warriors|3
This sub literally switches narrative depending on who wins (Cavs lose, Warriors win = Lebron is a bitch and Draymond isn't). It's pretty bipolar. |Raptors|29
Oh trust me, as a fellow raptor fan I know this all to well.|Raptors|1
When your favored team loses, you avoid /r/nba so as not to be reminded of it. When they win, you go to bask in the praise. This drives the switching narratives. |[GSW] Baron Davis|4
More like the people who like Draymond post more when he does well, and people who dislike him post more when he does poorly. Same with LeBron. Same with every team.|Supersonics|49
I\'m not saying it\'s the people who actually post but the silent voters who upvote those sentiments only when that respective player\'s team wins. If the Warriors lose you could see a "fuck Draymond" post as a top comment but the same one today would result in an avalanche of downvotes.\n\nThe silent voters are the bipolar ones. |Raptors|4

People that hate him try to make him out to be a fake(whether its his toughness or his game) but you have yet to see him cower when everything is on the line. He always steps up with his play. |Warriors|170
nope hes dirty. but he does play hard.|Bulls|-8
Except for when he goes completely invisible for an entire 7 game series like against us. \n\nHe plays hard, but most of the time too hard.|Thunder|-8
Seriously misguided if you think he went missing for the whole series. He had a couple bad games  but came through when it mattered. He plays hard every game, you are right.|Warriors|6
He avged 11/5/4 on like 35% shooting against us, he couldn\'t make an open layup to save his life. He was actually helping us out by being on the court for 40 mins a game and being doodoo, I loved it. \n\nThe rest I agree with. He is a spoiled douche though. He\'s the kind of guy that does some bullshit and you see the look on his face and think "...that bastard totally knows what he\'s doing, fuck him". That\'s just the kind of human he is, and that will never change.|Thunder|-5
need suicide watch bro you seem salty still?\n\nget over it you choked|Lakers|1
You're damn right I'm salty that we choked that shit away, it was pitiful. Never gonna forgive my guys for that. But I don't see how that changes the fact that Green was crap that series. Which was the whole point of this.|Thunder|0
So basically he went slightly lower than his season average(for the series) after having 2 bad games? You can hate the guy and I see that you do but calling him a spoiled douche is so far from the truth. You can call him a lot of terrible things but spoiled might not exactly be the right words. To each his own.|Warriors|7
i saw him cower Game 3 and in the thunder series with some poor ass performances|Pelicans|1
He definitely had a bad game 3. Not exactly the same thing as cowering. |Warriors|3
And he runs that team-- he's basically the point guard|Knicks|1
Are you pretending the OKC series didn't happen?  Draymond wasn't that great when everything was on the line.\n\nHe's definitely not a fake, but his kicks and flails are pretty pathetic.  That isn't how the body reacts to contact.|Mavericks|0
I only hate him because he is a dirty fucker, I don't deny the dude shows up. He kicked a guy in the nuts, that's slime, they weren't even fighting. |Raptors|4
skill, talent and physically, he always seems to me like a "bootleg Lebron". But what makes him so effective, is that he works hard and he knows his strengths and focuses on that. Also helps that the pieces around him complement him perfectly.\n\nI think he could be a memorable great in the game at the end of his career, especially if this Warrior group stick together for a few more years.|Warriors|6
I don't make him out to be fake, I think he's a punk. But he is really good. |[HOU] Hakeem Olajuwon|3
I don't think there's anything fake about him, he's just a dick. ||11
people were calling him a fake for acting tough. If anything tonight he showed that he really doesn't give a fuck, even against lebron ||5
Almost better than that, he's honest with himself when he does have a bad game, and owns up to it. He doesn't have much of a personal ego, seemingly. BUT Draymond seems to have an ego and arrogancy for the Warriors as a team. It's very interesting.|Warriors|10
almost like he's the warriors grandma |Warriors|0
These fools don't know that Draymond will do literally anything for a win and prove doubters wrong. |Bulls|42
He's the Tanya Harding of basketball. |Spurs|4
You can't question the guy's passion for the game.  I'd take that over someone phoning in a performance any day.|Spurs|58

No, this full healthy Cavs team had a very small chance at giving the Warriors a challenge. After the 7 game series with OKC it was obvious that momentum was going to carry the Warriors all the way through this. Warriors in 5 was a very easy prediction to make. There was no way Cavs were going to win both games in Cleveland and it was very obvious that their Warriors were going to win their first 2 games at home.|Lakers|6

Indeed they do. Cavs looked solid tonight. Warriors ...had their moments up until the end. |Warriors|1
KLove should've played in the final 5 minutes when the Cavs were down nearly 10 points - it's the equivalent of pulling the goalie in hockey.  What they surrender in defense they make up for in offensive firepower.  I agree that he shouldn't have started - but his presence was missed down the stretch.|Timberwolves|10
Kyrie may have been playing ISO in the fourth and taking contested difficult shots, but what else was he going to do? Nobody was cutting or setting off ball screens, LeBron looked like he didn't want to be there which is inexplicable. If you ask me out of the big three Kyrie was the only one who looked genuinely invested in the game right till the end, you could see it on his face. ||10
And he had the best game out of anyone on the cavs, he was the only one trying to be aggressive all game. He kept them in the game especially while lebron was MIA in the first half.\n\nOf course though it's all kyrie fault because look James almost got a triple double.|[LAL] Kobe Bryant|3

Dude it's been pretty obvious Mozgov is a waste at this point and Delly gives you nothing except defense. |New Jersey Nets|5
How so? Mozgov dominated in last years finals. He played 7 minutes in game 3. 5 of which were in garbage time. Kyrie was scoring easy off of his screens and he gets effortless rebounds. He's also a 80%+ FT shooter. \n\nIf you even get 50% of his production from last year that would be huge. It's clear he would be way more effective than Love against the warriors. Lue just doesn't have a c**lue**. |Cavaliers|2
Delly has been getting torched.  |Warriors|2

If he had pushed you back you\'d be playing the victim like you always do.But don\'t worry I\'d be upset to if I was about to lose my FIFTH Finals series but you\'re considered "The King".

So you agree then?||2

That Wade didnt win on his own.||1
He basically did yes Shaq that year was in the twilight of his career but the Heat have been Wade's team since he's been there. Plus he won Finals MVP that year||3
Shaq was still really good that year. you dont sound like someone who understands basketball that well.||2
Well that's your opinion it's like an asshole everyone has one||2

Ok? Doesn't change my point either way. LeBron left Miami when the ship was sinking. Wade aging, and he probably knew about Bosh's health issues. |Cavaliers|1
It's amazing how hot and cold this sub gets. The playoffs need to end and the LeBron die hards need a hard dose of reality.

I'm not excusing lebron, he played bad, and he needs to step up. But man, how hypocritical is your post? When steph struggles, he gets 35 from his bench, or 28 from Draymond, his team plays great defense, and they still win in blowouts. You're a laker fan, I'm sure you remember kobe going 6/24 in game 7 of the 2010 Finals, but his team still bailed him out. LeBron never gets the leisure of struggling and having his team bail him out, especially not in the Finals. Look at 2011, Wade and Bosh could do nothing when LeBron struggled.|Cavaliers|-5
Lol anyone who brings up kobes 6/24 doesent know what the fuck they are talking about. That game was all defense, almost every player on both sides had as many shots as points the game was 55-59 in the fourth, kobe got 10 points and 4 boards in the 4th to take the lead. He also played defense the whole game. Kobe wanted it and his poor shooting through 3 quarters didn't stop him from trying to win the game. Watch the games not the fucking stats he came when they needed something to happen in a game 7 of the finals.\n\n\nBut of course lebron fans are obsessed with the stats and that's why lebron likes to pad them too, the guy had 19 until he got 6 points on pointless layups when that wasn't gonna give them a win. |[LAL] Kobe Bryant|3
Are you out of you damn mind? \n\n1. This post has 0 to do with Stephen Curry. I'm a hypocrite when I didn't even mention the man?\n\n2. Yeah I remember Kobe in the 2010 Finals, I remember the 15 boards he crashed when his shot wasn't falling, I remember the 3/14 he held Ray Allen to, I remember how he still led the game in scoring. What I don't remember is him ever bitching at Rondo or Ray Allen when things looked bleak.\n\n3. Wade and Bosh could do nothing when LeBron struggled? Dwyane Wade averaged 27/7/5 my man, and Bosh averaged 19/7, both scoring more than James did. So I don't know what the hell you're talking about here.|[LAL] Kobe Bryant|6
1) You\'re a hypocrite if you passed on criticizing curry \n\n2) "I remember the 15 boards he crashed". LeBron last night had 13 boards. " I remember the 3/14 he held Ray Allen to". LeBron held Green to 2/9 and Iggy to 4/12, but then you went and said he got  "outplayed by Andre Iguodala". Kobe didn\'t bitch during that game because he won, but he did bitch to LeBron when his Lakers got smoked by the Heat during the Christmas game in 2010. You could tell he was frustrated and just kept talking. Same with LeBron last night. Another reason you\'re a hypocrite, you brush of Kobe\'s struggles, and you\'re quick to pounce on LeBron for his struggles.\n\n3) Curry averaged 13 ppg in the first 3 games of the series. 4-5 other Warriors players averaged more than him, and his team still pulled out 2 blowout wins. LeBron doesn\'t have that luxury, when he struggles, his team isn\'t winning. Period. \n\n|Cavaliers|1
To be fair, this is the kind of post you never see after the MVP loses a game with an equally bad performance.||-11
For real. Lebron didn't play good today, but when Curry is sucking out there everyone makes excuses for the guy. |Raptors|-8
Lol what excuses he didn't play well but he showed up tonight in what was probably the most important game in this series.|[LAL] Kobe Bryant|2
The MVP was up 2-1 after that loss. He had slack. ||4
I'm not sure if you're serious. But the entire Warriors team played like shit on Wednesday. \n\nThe Cavs today? Not so much. |[LAL] Kobe Bryant|8
I've watched him get swept in 2007, score 8 on 3-11 shooting against the Mavs, get bailed out in 2013 by a miracle that he gets all the credit for, get annihilated in 2014, but this is to me his worst performance in the Finals. No heart, no hustle, and worst of all no brain. But most importantly, No. Excuses. It's enough. |Bulls|15

No, they were up 3-1 at the time and won in convincing fashion. It's not really an overreaction to think they should've won.|Warriors|1
For all the people who have NEVER REALLY PLAYED BALL.\n\nDraymond green is an amazing player. I know you are used to 2k and players being literally the product of complex algorithms but real players understand how to win and Dray just got into "THE KINGS" head and completely took him out of the game.\n\nI know I\'ll get down voted into oblivion but whatever at least I\'m not blind. ||116
Yea you'll def get downvoted in the Golden State post game jerkoff thread|Knicks|-2
Green is a player you want on your team but not against. He's a douche. Does little dirty stuff here and there. \n\nAlso he got into lebron's head when the game was over. ||5
He got into brons head and THEN, the game was over||13
They were up 10 when this whole ordeal happened.... ||5
LeBron has both the talent and the team to come back from 10. He's still in the game at that point.\n\nEdit: sorry I read this wrong, it's late. I'm an idiot|Bucks|4
It's all good. Looking forward to game 5. I have a weird feeling it goes to 7 with the dubs winning by 10. ||2

Sorry, only a very privileged few of us are able to play sportsball growing up.|Cavaliers|5
he's a beast! only people who don't play ball hate him||30

Love flops like a bitch at the 3-point line, no comment from announcers.\n\nVarejao flops a little bit under the goal, announcers suddenly want fouls to be overturned by replay.||15
Varejao has a history.  Either way, both fouls Love committed on Varejao were correct calls regardless of flopping (which they totally were lol).|Warriors|1

The Warriors gave Cleveland a win just so they could win it all at home.||15

What? That the NBA decided a bunch of uneducated thugs should win their "Championship". Well they got their payday, a bunch of ignorant fans from Cleveland still believe it wasn\'t rigged, and morons like yourself Pat themselves on the back as if it is some kind of great achievement.||1
Uneducated thugs? I'm an African-American male and you sound like the exact type of backward Indiana racist I have had the pleasure of staying away from my entire life.

He already has as many turnovers as he did in 2011. He fluffed his stats this game. His jumper looks awful. It's just not great ball from him. He's passing up easy looks at the basket like he did in 2011 as well. He was in the right mindset during game 3, but idk I guess the defense got to him and he got a little jumpy.\n||6

warriors kept it close then exploded in the second half.|Warriors|1
W-will Barkley be okay?||6
yea|[MIA] Dwyane Wade|1
Theres so many things i dont understand about cavs game. Whole 4th quarter they're lazily jacking up 3s, against the best 3pt shooting team in history. And then only when they are down by 10 with 2 minutes left do they finally start driving to the basket... but are fouling Klay and Curry every possession to stop the clock, making it impossible to make up any ground. How could any of this possibly work? Im not coaching genius but I can fucking count, obviously the exact opposite should have been happening.\n\nI dont see why people are hating on Kyrie though. He and bron were the only ones who didnt appear to have completely given up 2 minutes into the 4th. |Celtics|6
Lue didn't rest his best guys in the 2nd Half. Their legs died. It leads to lazy offense, which explaithethe chucking. The last six minutes are rife with timeouts, but those legs were already mostly spent. The Cavs would burst out of the timeout, then fade. GS was rested and held the lead. It was easy for them|Warriors|2
Steph Curry is Regigigas confirmed, and 5 turns have apparently passed.||7
Legit analogy.|Bulls|2

Livingston seems to be playing pretty damn well. Or maybe Draymond?||6
I think Draymond or Steph. Despite playing below his standards for the first three games, Steph is still averaging almost 22 ppg. If he has a big game 5, I think he gets it. |Warriors|5
I know this sounds crazy...but Iggy might get back-to-back MVPs. If not him then Draymond probably will. Curry will need a monster Game 5 and (if necessary) Game 6 to secure it.|[PHO] Steve Nash|5

There's gonna be a lot of blame on Love, but it was Lebron and Kyrie killing the Cavs' offense with hero ball from the end of the 3rd through the 4th.\n\nI think I counted 10 of 12 possessions in a row that were iso, before I stopped counting.|Pistons|15
To be fair kyrie is the only reason they were in this game. |New Jersey Nets|4
I usually dont think its one players fault and even in this case it was more than just Kevin Love at fault, but when you're struggling a bit offensively and give up 4-5 off. rebounds, its just psychologically draining. I thought thats when the Cavs became fragile mentally and Warriors seemed to play controlled after that.||1
Watching bronbron try to goon it up and then pad his stats at the end in a loss was delicious.   Mmmmm. |Warriors|38

One of the worst officiated finals games ever. You can say they let both sides get away with everything, or they're letting them play, but I don't care - it makes the game so frustrating to watch. Call a foul if it's a foul regardless. Can't stand this officiating|Celtics|75
It's not good but it's better than a call every possession imo|Warriors|0
lmfao. no it wasn't.|[LAL] Kobe Bryant|-3
yep \n\nI still think goldwn state wins buy it was shitty basketball to watch due to lack of calls. Everyone is against soft calls... but no call is the opposite side of the spectrum|Magic|1
I agree the officiating has been bad but I do like the consistency. If your gonna let players play, having both teams get away with fouls is better than just one. No one wants to see a 2002 Lakers-Kings series again. |Warriors|2

i know people were like "it\'s not love, it\'s everyone!" but i mean, the cavs played so well when love was playing limited minutes in the first half\n\nliterally as soon as him and kyrie were on the floor together and love started playing heavy minutes in the second half, the cavs defense and ball movement just fucking died\n\nnot only can you not have love and kyrie on the floor because it opens up obvious and glaring holes in the defense, but apparently love\'s inability to move without the ball or do cuts or like anything, it forces lebron to start to iso, which in turn inevitably forces kyrie to iso when they start plugging the paint on lebron (because kyrie can\'t pass so it automatically turns to iso)\n\ni seriously think he destroys both the offense and defensive flow of the team when irving is on with him\n\nif lebron doesn\'t leave cleaveland next year, one of kyrie and love have to not be on the team||5

Translates to not gonna happen |West|0
Got that right.|Raptors|1
I know that for most of the people that visit /r/NBA follow the NBA closely enough to avoid fickle kneejerk opinions, but I think to the casual fans out there Lebron\'s seeming inability to bring a championship to Cleveland is going to hurt his legacy. Or at least his perceived legacy. \n\nFor a long time people have been pushing the "Will he overtake/match Jordan?" angle, and I think not bringing a ring to Cleveland will remind them of a whole lot of other talented basketball players that he might still have to pass (hell, in popular media it seems like a forgone conclusion that he\'s gonna have a better career than Kobe... And I suppose in some circles he already has... though those circles often like to say wacky shit for ratings/page view). \n\nI think Lebron is a damn good player. But this series is going to cut down the Lebron deification IMO. ||5
Agreed. LBJ is playing with a really incredible team. They've played incredible basketball up until this series. But the fact that he can't carry his team to a finals win in back to back years... with a team that has Love and Kyrie (their team payroll is how much? 120mil or something?)... that's disappointing.\n\nYou gotta give GSW credit though- LBJ has played against an absolutely amazing team that just has more cards to play than his own. Plus, Kerr as coach has provided an important advantage for GSW versus Blatt, and especially Lue. |Lakers|1
Well and like I said, people that come to /r/NBA generally are a cut above the average fans, and were a little more cautious on the MJ2.0 hype train that Nike and Bubblicious shoved everyone on out of the gate. \n\nIf he can't get Cleveland a championship, regardless of the actual basketball reasons, he's going to have to hold that L in the public's perception. ||2

problem is he's really scared to shoot||2
Jordan's 1998 performance is going to be impossible for LeBron to top at this rate.  MJ carried his Bulls throughout the regular season, and for most of the Finals after Pippen's back gave out.  Even though his percentages dropped a bit, he still made smart plays and played an intelligent game of basketball, even when it was clear he was barely able to stand.\n\nLeBron has shown this series that his decision-making skills fall off a cliff when he's tired.  He takes tough, contested long-twos, forces bad passes, and barely reacts to mismatches.|Spurs|3
> Jordan's 1998 performance is going to be impossible for LeBron to top at this rate.\n\nFirst ever to come back from a 3-1 deficit, against what seemed like an unstoppable juggernaut that went 73-9 in the regular season. A team that had the first unanimous MVP, and two of the best shooters of all time. He took two games at Oracle, where the Warriors had only lost two games all year. When he got counted out, he had back to back 41 point games and then sealed the deal in Oakland with a triple double. First player to lead both teams in points, rebounds, assists, steals, blocks (i.e, every major statistic) in a playoff series, and he's done it in the finals. I think he's done it.|[MIA] Dwyane Wade|1

B-bb-bbbb-but game 6 against the Celtics.  WHO FUCKING  CARES. |Bulls|2
I think that Lebron is ultimately more of a facilitator/team player than a finisher. He really needs a player alongside him who can pour it in because although he's a good scorer, he's not a legendary monster in terms of just getting hot and knocking down shots. I think he tried to replicate the Bosh/Wade formula with Love/Irving, but the Cleveland sidekicks just aren't on par with what he had in Miami. He needs to go to a team with a coldblooded scorer who can capitalize on all of the great things he does. |Warriors|2
Lebron's lack of a jumpshot makes him so predictable. That, and Golden State has a lot of size that can deal with Lebron down low.|Cavaliers|3
Don't see how anyone can even consider him for that title. Top 5? Sure. GOAT? It will always be MJ. Can't beat 6-0 with 6 finals MVPs and his ability to take over in the playoffs.|Lakers|10
People in the future will look at the stats and go, look how efficient he was! But he basically did nothing in the 4th and garbage timed himself 6 points in the last 40 seconds.|Lakers|11
He's going for the finals MVP not the championship |Warriors|4
Which I don't undsrstand. He's not getting it if they lose. Idgaf what anyone says, finals MVP goes to the winning team. |Spurs|2
He can, however, boost his stats in garbage time with easy dunks\n\nThe Bronsexuals s are ready to point to these sheets to say "if only his teammates performed!!!!1!"|West|105

They are down 9 fouling curry and Thompson\n\nAnd he was taking layups and dunks\n\nHow is that trying to win?\n\nHe could have shot 3s or passed to jr |Lakers|21
game was over and he was taking the buckets they gave up|[ORL] Tracy McGrady|-7
it was over because he took those shots |Lakers|15
Yes he did exactly that. He knew the game was over, but instead of shooting threes, which is what he knew he needed to do. He did a bunch of angry dunks. Interesting. What does MVP mean again?|Warriors|8
Thompson went HAM, and IMO Irving was Better than him today\n\nBut I know Lebron is great, but he was clearly frustrated by GSW defense tonight. I hate when the LeApologists think they only ever lose cuz of everyone but Lebron |West|17

Ehh besides his 6 garbage time layups he had like 19 points through the game, and that's a perfect example of lebron stat padding. I mean they are down 9 with like a minute to go and he's taking 3 layups, with gsw free throw shooting you know you aren't coming back like that.|[LAL] Kobe Bryant|1

Livingston or Iguodala for finals MVP?|Lakers|1
Iggy for sure. His defense is just fucking money.\n\nBut I could argue Shaun if he brings another 15-20pt game at home. Bonus points to Shaun if he get these points in klay-clutch moments. ||2
True. Iggy has been taking bron's lunch money each game. So many great strips on lebron that it's been such a pleasure to watch. Especially because he does it so well that refs can't call shit on him.|Lakers|2
LeBron's suit looks like he should be singing a musical number about lime-flavored candy|Warriors|5
So disappointed in the last 5 min of the game. No ball movement. Iso panic mode. My God move the ball like game 3. But gsw played hard nose defense and finally got Steph and klay going. Kyrie was balling though but too much isolated drives.||4
The difference between ESPN and NBATV/Inside the NBA post game coverage is night and day. ESPN is just terrible with how structured they try to keep it. |Thunder|4
So according to the source master Chris brousard Dreymond green called LeBron a bitch which is what set him off thoughts anyone ???|West|3

Iguodala mvp again for shutting down lebron.|[DET] Andre Drummond|5
I'm personally in between Iggy and Steph for MVP. It's close.|Lakers|2
Steph has been shut down for 3 of 4. Hard to get a MVP for that.  |Raptors|2
I'm in the same boat but I think Iggy should get it. To be fair Steph wasn't the biggest contributor for a good amount of time this finals but Iggy was very consistent and very good. I'd love to see Iggy get it back to back but I have a feeling they won't give it to him just because he got it last year and there's more name power in Steph. We'll see though!! Iggy for MVP!||2
Watch, Draymond gets suspended for his nut shot on Lebron this time, just to keep this series going.||3
I think that'll happen, too. They should just roll with it, but they won't. ESPN doesn't help, they're like girls when their drama-sense is tingling.|Celtics|4
Holy shit..  Good you GS, doing some goddamn work out there.  \n\nI hope when they win, folks realize how good they are, afraid they will just be wrapped up in talking about how weak the Cavs are though. ||3

Cleveland has 0 depth. It is literally Lebron and Kyrie carrying the team.....and usually individually. God Damnit Love, you had one fucking job!\n\nCould you imagine if CP3 was on the Cav's. That work ethic alone would be huge. ||7
They'd still just go to Hero ball in the clutch|Bucks|1
CP3 passes more than he should ||1
the whole season everybody was saying the Cavs have depth. They do have depth. But the matchup problems with the warriors and lue's coaching has resulted in the cavs not utilizing their depth at all|Cavaliers|2
I honestly have only watched them during the playoffs. But is it really depth when they played significantly weaker teams that they really did not even need a bench for?||1
CP3 is a bigger choker than Lebron. But this is what happens when you take a short cut to the championship. |Mavericks|2
Obvious first attempt at a fix is trade Love.  But as an OKC fan I'd be interested in seeing them try to trade for Shump.  Seems like the 3 and D 2 guard they have desperately needed.|NBA|2
roberson is 1000000X better than S(c)hump||1
As an OKC fan you want to see OKC trade for Shump?||1
Shump has a better shot than Roberson, and I think can play better in a different place.  He seems checked out in Cleveland now.  I'm aware he has under achieved this year.\n\nFull disclosure:  I went to Georgia Tech and want to see Shump succeed.|NBA|1
Maybe Space Jam 2's plot is that LeBron lost his jumpshot and he needs Bugs and his friends' help to get it back.\n\nMaybe they are already doing the film?|Heat|7
Maybe these Finals are just going to be scenes in the new movie?|West|4
Does anyone have a gif of Igoudala stiff arming someone?|Warriors Bandwagon|7
Does anyone else think maybe they realized they couldn't hit jumpers so they were going for layups with lots of contact for and-1s but just wouldn't get calls.|Cavaliers|7
I hope not because with that lead the smart play is to guard the 3 and let them get uncontested layups.  It's fairly basic basketball strategy, but I guess it's possible that Lue is not familiar with it.|[LAL] Mark Madsen|1

"I am getting hit, but the refs aren\'t seeing it that way" - Lebron\n\nstay classy, there were no calls on both sides of the ball. Major ones. |Warriors|7
Kevin Love lost Cleveland this game when he got continually bitched by Anderson Fucking Varejao. I couldn't believe what I was watching. \n\nLeBron also shrinked and got frustrated towards the end. Can't see how the cavs can win game 5 let alone the series. |[PHI] Evan Turner|9
It's half Love's fault, half Lue's for keeping him in during crucial stretches.|Trail Blazers|1
You say that like it's an insult.\nVarejao was a borderline All star player before all his injuries. |Lakers|3
He's a washed up 33 year old. No excuse. |[PHI] Evan Turner|4
My semi unbiased take on the game:\n\n1. The refs were absolute trash, inconsistent on both ends of the floor and really let the game get out of their control. I was seriously surprised there wasnt a double tech on Lebron and Green during their scuffle.\n\n2. Cavs absolutely lost this game in the 4th, Lue was absolute trash by letting them run iso plays and trying to play hero ball and playing Lebron and Kyrie nearly the entire second half. Also, what was he thinking by having Frye out there with Kyrie trying to guard Curry off the pick??? Golden State played a semi solid game (mainly because the refs just messed up the entire game so badly). Steph Curry is a great player and you certainly should NOT let him get free off of those picks. Klay Thompson also had a solid performance. \n\n3. Lebron just looked so much less aggressive than he should have. He didn't have a bad game by all means, he nearly had a triple double, however, he has TOO MANY TURNOVERS (to quote the 2k15 coach).\n\nOverall, I think this game was hard to watch for both fans due to how horrid the officiating was. I still hope my Cavs can win it, but both the players and Lue need to get their shit together. Congrats to GS on the win. Like I said, this was an extremely poorly officiated game on both ends so there is no reason we should be acting like the refs acted in favor of one team over the other.|Cavaliers|10

What low note?|Warriors|1
lol|[MIA] Dwyane Wade|2
So glad it turned around up until that point it was boring. Couldn't have more happy with the outcome||2
Once again all I notice is how LeBron will drive hard to the rim and kick the ball back out. He also has multiple times matched up with Curry and still wants to pass the ball. At some point someone has to tell LeBron to take over when he can easily get his way. Too much facilitation in the finals on his part. ||6

Go Warriors!|Bullets|3
I have the solution for real though for the Cavs, you guys:\n\nStep 1) hot tub time machine.\n\nStep 2) Untrade Andrew Wiggins for Kevin Love.\n\nStep 3) ???|Kings|3
Kyrie - JR - Wiggins - Lebron - Thompson would be a pretty good lineup against the Dubs|Lakers|4
LeBron needs to just play power forward full-time. \n\nGet an athletic wing with a bit of size who can switch with him on defense if need be. \n\nI suggested Love for Crowder and Olynyk and got downvoted to hell for it because apparently Love is worth 100x more than that or something, but I think that it'd be a good trade for the Cavaliers. Hell, if that really is pennies on the dollar for Love, ask for Bradley, too.\n\nKyrie-Bradley-Crowder-LeBron-Thompson  \n\nThe Celtics will not trade all of that for Kevin Love, though. |Nets|3
They should be doing literally whatever they can to salvage that trade *while* they still can, though given the fact that they seem to be better off without him and it's relatively obvious to rest of the world, I can't imagine they have too much leverage left.|Kings|1
A number of Celtics fans see Kevin Love as basically David Lee with a good 3-point shot... and the C's let David Lee go for nothing after the trade deadline. Heck, there was a report that Danny Ainge wouldn't trade Crowder for Jimmy Butler... that's how much we love Crowder over in Beantown. \n\nI think that the best that Cleveland might realistically get from Boston is a package of Bradley, Amir Johnson and picks/salary fodder to make it work -- forget about any of the Brooklyn picks. Even then, there'll be C's fans who'll get furious with that trade -- that's how far down in esteem Kevin Love has come. |Celtics|2
Definitely. It's just kind of maddening if you're a Cavs fan (maddeningly hilarious if you're an outside observer) that they actually probably had a demonstrably ***better*** formula for matching up against them, and ended up completely shooting themselves in the foot by trading away a player they could desperately use right now in exchange for somebody that, honestly, I can't imagine they even want on the court. They literally paid out the nose so they could downgrade.\n\nBut hey, wouldn't be Cleveland otherwise!|Kings|7

[deleted]||1
Man!!!!!!! MAN!!!!!!!! MAAAAAAAAAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nWhat a ride.\n\nI was ultimately resigned that this was over. Game 5 was a gimme. I didn\'t expect to win game six, but viewed 7 as a nice bow on the top of a very good season. In the back of my mind I was thinking "Idk one game anything can happen, right?"  But even up 3 with 30 seconds I kept my expectations in check, because Cleveland.\n\nBut man. I was at that watch party in be Q last night. That was so electric that\'s \xe2\x80\xa6 amazing \xe2\x80\xa6 \n\nI\'ve never been a part of anything like that. Wild!!!|Cavaliers|1

Anyone have a GIF where LeBron yells at the ref because he was run over by Curry. Happened in the 2nd qtr. 3:15 left.|Heat|3
Main differencr between the cavs and warriors that ive noticed? \n\nWhether the warriors are up or down on the scoreboard, they maintain their cohesion and continue to play like its not over. I really cant say that for the cavs. A 200 million dollar roster can not build chemistry like the warriors have. I believe the cavs could have won a 'ship this season; they are talented and driven. However, they lack the intangibles. Also wtf Tyron Lue? ||3
lmao|Cavaliers|2
LeBron was a giant bitch the entire game. Kyrie and LeBron disappeared in the 4th quarter. The Cavs shot 15 for 26 from the free throw line and Cavs fans want to blame the refs for the loss. Curry is backed. League is fucked. Warriors repeat in 5.|[LAL] Kobe Bryant|16

I just don't get these guys. They're in the NBA Finals yet they just look like they can't be fucked playing. Sure they were great in Game 3, but other than that they've been passive and soft, standing around watching the ball half the time. Besides probably Thompson, they're all guilty of it, even LeBron stood under the rim watching Draymond pick up offensive rebounds. I dunno, maybe it's just me but if I was in the Finals I'd try play like I cared about winning a little more.|Suns|4

I'm crowning this Golden State's era. Steph is getting a guaranteed 4 rings as long as they can keep him surrounded with Draymond, Klay, and Barnes. They come back 3-1 and then go up 3-1 against a healthy Cavs squad that they had trouble beating last year. How is a team this good!?!?||5

Does anyone think that MJ and Kobe were right when they went onto the court and just hated their opponent to get that mental edge? Cuz to me it looked like LeBron finally snapped and did it their way last night.||4
Every player is different, but I personally do believe in the notion that LBJ doesn't have the same killer mentality that lifted MJ and Kobe to greatness. LBJ seemed to pass off when he had great opportunities to drive to the rim a little too much in this game and G1, in my opinion. But LBJ is his own man... he dominates in his own way, whether it's with that killer mentality or not.|Lakers|7
I'm not rubbing in at all or trying to call you out, just curious if those last 3 games changed your mind at all. |Cavaliers|1
I'm not saying he doesn't dominate. Just looking at his numbers can show you how good he is and watching him play supports how dominant he is in the game. What I saw last night with Draymond and everything in game 3, he was out to kill someone like MJ and Kobe in their careers. I loved last night's game b/c I miss the big man/physical play of yesteryear.||2
TFW Golden State throws game 3 so they can win it at home, and Cleveland still cant do shit about it||5

The Cleveland Cavaliers just beat the Cleveland Cavaliers tonight. Up by 8 in the third, losing that lead then resorting to ISO ball playing right into GS hands. Pathetic ||12

He's talking about how LeBron should've taken 3s at the end to at least try and win the game.|Warriors|1
The whole logic of intentional fouls is to make goals until they miss a free throw. at which point you're 2 for 1. You only try for desperation 3s when there's no shot clock||1
Personally I think it's silly as hell to say this Warriors team can beat the showtime Lakers.\n\nBut 20 years from now in 2K36, you can be damn sure that this 73-9 team will be featured as one of the classics.|Nets|7
As a warriors fan, I love it! Seeing curry on the cover last year was great. FINALY a warrior to represent. |Warriors|2
I know, right? Its weird, being so good, that we get disrespected for it. This used to be saved for Mid '00 lakers, spurs (this is give it to Duncan and clear out Spurs), and heat.||1
That's not a binary equation though.  Regardless of whether they could beat the Showtime Lakers or the '96 Bulls they went 73-9.  It's getting brought up at least until it's broken and even then they will be compared with all the other G.O.A.T. contenders.   ||2

LeBron losing his cool sealed the game. Draymond Green didn't even do much of anything and was able to get under his skin. LeBron is most likely going to have a monster game at Oracle, but the question will be whether his teammates can show up with him.\n\nWe will witness something legendary in game 5: one of the best finals performances of all time or the best regular season team of all time capping it off with a championship. Can't wait.|[LAL] Kobe Bryant|4
I donno man. Lebron's jumper is flawed this season. He's going to need to drive every single possession to have a godlike game.|Celtics|1
Worst officiating ive seen in a long time, both ways.  JVG was right, they weren\'t "Letting them play".  They were letting players commit fouls without repercussion.|Warriors|3
Notes for the night \n\nWarriors had more heart in the 2nd or fuel because the Cavs went flat\n\nK love got too many minutes, 15 should have been the most he got with his bench worthy production and defensive issues in the 4th.\n\nToo many mistakes from Irving on the switches leaving Klay or Steph open\n\nStagnant offense, most likely related to being tired from the short rotation.\n\nMo Williams should have seen a few minutes to give Irving a break, Delly should have also played a bit more.\n\nThe x factor didn't show up, Channing Frye didn't do much sadly, JR went missing again.\n\nLebron did not take over and I guess he though his jump shot was back, sadly it wasn't, he was passive and while we stayed in the game, he should have been more aggressive from the start, he did not set the tone from game 3.\n\nShump playing like garbage, needs to sit in the gym and learn from uncle drew on how to handle the rock.\n\n\nOverall good game to the warriors, y'all worked for it and got it, see you for game 5 in Oakland.|Cavaliers|4
Cavs fans...remember how you felt after the 2011 finals? Thats how i feel now :)|Heat|4
LeBron is not the best player in the league anymore because of his inability to shoot jumpers. It is honestly back to his pre-2009 form, maybe worse. |Warriors|3

I gotta say. David Blatt's final is looking alot better than Lue's final. |Raptors|4
Is it now?|Raptors|1
Checked LeBron stats and didn't even notice he was doing so much. \n\n* 25pts (don't look at this though. Around 6 added from the stat padding time) \n\n* 13reb\n\n* 9ast\n\n* 2stl\n\n* 3blk\n\nStill wasn't enough though. I wish he aimed to score instead of obviously pass during the earlier quarters. \n\nIt does kinda seem that he's getting the Shaq treatment. Some of his drives looked like he was getting hacked but the lack of close ups make it unclear. \n\nAt least it was a close game compared to the first 3 games. Refs were terrible on both sides though. ||6
I guarantee you didn't watch the game right? He looked like shit out there. He had 18 points before padding his stats in the last minute. Stop with the bullshit foul excuses. ||6
Why do you think I said I didn't notice he did that much? I thought he didn't have that much assists and rebounds since he was playing terrible that's why I was surprised looking at the stats. \n\nStop with the fucking assumption that everyone is defending LeBron.\n\nYou specifically mentioned the stat padding. Did you not notice me mentioning that as well? ||5
Of course he'll get those rebounds and assists. Instead of taking over he passes every play looking scared. Then at the last minute he finally decides to turn it up. And why do you fail to mention his 7 turnovers. ||2
7 turnovers. You forgot the 7 turnovers and 4 fouls, and the plays you can't count like missed assignments and loss of plays to wining to refs.||2
you 'forgot' the 7 turnover and game low +/-\n\ndon't be surprised if people assume you're making excuses for him|Kings|3

R/nba is going crazy, the salt train is departing from cleveland|Warriors|1
Thank god I fell asleep again and didn't have to watch how the Cavs gave it away. What happened?|[CLE] LeBron James|2
Cavs were down 8 for about five possessions and got stops but could capitalize on them.|[LAL] Mark Madsen|1
1. Benching TT in favor of Frye, gave alot of 2nd chances to warriors and Frye couldnt keep up with defensive assignments at all.\n\n\n2. Not resting lebron and kyrie, dudes looked gassed/frustrated in 4th.\n\n3. Letting tired lebron and kyrie iso the game away.  I think they went like 6 mins without scoring a bucket.\n\n\nThose three things helped the warriors control the tempo and gave them a bunch of open looks. They went from ok we have this game under control series to what are we even doing on both ends of the court.|[LAL] Didier Ilunga-Mbenga|1
I looked at the box score and was surprised that Delly only played 5 minutes. I also didn't understand why Lebron didn't get to sit earlier in G3 (not that it would've mattered that much, but still), he could've easily played 2 minutes less. \n\n\nLooks like the Cavs are making the same mistakes as in the first two games, including Lue. |[CLE] LeBron James|1
I am not sure the Cavs had a possession in the 4th quarter where they passed the ball more than once. Warriors played good defense and they just couldn't score. Splash Brothers finally had good games.|Warriors|1
>I am not sure the Cavs had a possession in the 4th quarter where they passed the ball more than once.\n\nSounds like it wasn't just the Warriors defense, but reverting back to bad habits by the Cavs? Whose fault was that? Single players' (Kyrie?) or the coach's? |[CLE] LeBron James|1
A little bit of all of the above. Good defense by the Warriors. The Cavs seemed gassed and frustrated. There were definitely possessions where the Warriors got a nice 3 and Kyrie ran down the court and tried to jack up a quick three to get it back and it bricked out. Lebron was a big issue, as he had been all game, taking long ISOs but not actually getting to the rim and scoring. If I was a cleveland fan I'd be so mad at how many times Lebron had Curry guarding him, but didn't take advantage and drove and passed out of it. Lue also is obviously responsible in terms of getting his team to follow a more cohesive offensive plan all the way through.\n\nI'm also not sure what happened to TT. He was murdering us the first half and then either didn't make an impact or was on the bench for the rest of the game. |Warriors|1
Damn the fans looked like their souls got snatched\n||2

The Cavs lost because they didn't defend as well as they did in game 3. Another point Lebron kept passing instead of  forcing his way to the basket. Playing Kevin Love was a mistake he is CLEARLY still out of sorts with missed free throws that he normally makes. PS: Just how bad is Iman Shumpert in this NBA finals?. He shouldn't play on Monday!.||2
Can someone explained to me why Shumpert has gotten more minutes than Delly? They seem to do a lot of the same things except Shumpert doesn't have a reliable three point shot anymore.|Mavericks|1
Shumpert has something on Tyronn Lue cause his shooting has deserted him!!. Channing Fyre might be better than him at this moment.||2

Damn, just noticed LeBron played 45+ mins|Knicks|2
Cavaliers just froze in the second half! All that intensity while defending and harrying in the first half was nowhere to be found. The one game plan that befuddled me was why Lue didn't play Tristan as much in the second half? He had a terrific game with so many offensive rebounds. \n\nThe last quarter was rubbish from Cavs. Did they not have a plan?  Couldn't they just have played the same way they did in the first half? I don't see them upsetting the Warriors at Oakland. ||2
That game was nice. Thats my assessment.|Warriors|2
Cavs shot 25% from 3 pt and 57% from the FT line... no wonder they lost||2

We were a pretty good defensive team under Mark Jackson actually too. Steve Kerr has improved things, and Ron Adams is great, but our defense wasn't the revolutionary change he brought.|Warriors|1
he also turned the offense from being like 15th in the league to #1|Warriors|1
the addition of ron adams made them a smart defensive team|Warriors|1
Ron Adams a damn good assistant, especially on the defensive side of things|Bulls|1

Drive in....could murder everyone on the court with a dunk but instead "passes" it out to...oh oops wrong team), fuck cleveland for being so damn depressing, fuck the thunder because duh, fuck durant but he should go to washington.|Grizzlies|2
I don't understand why the Cavs' gameplan was to speed up the game, play small ball, and basically give Klay and Curry more opportunities to get going offensively||2
Lebron isn't leaving Cleveland. I expect Love to be gone in the offseason. They need more depth. \n\nhttp://basketball.realgm.com/nba/teams/Golden-State-Warriors/9/Free_Agency/Future\n\nI doubt they're all staying. I fully expect Barnes to go get some more money somewhere else.|Supersonics|2

I don't really get the end play by the Cavaliers. They seemed to kind of give up, only go for 2 pointers. What about this? I'm just saying, you string some 3's together and anything can happen.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjwKSwwcdyU\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceLlz7dOOvY||2

I don't get how this entire subreddit knows that all the iso-plays by the Cavs won't work, still it's all the Cavs are using during long stretches of the game|Warriors|2
Cavaliers need a decent center player desperately. Love and Thompson are both better as power forwards and should stick to that position...IMO Cav's should try and get Biyombo from the Raptors in the off season and get rid of Love. Biyombo may not be a scorer but it's not like they need that anyway with Kyrie and Lebron playing so much ISO ball. They need someone to be aggressive on the rebounds and TT and Biyombo would be a great defensive pair together. Lebron was the team leader in rebounds in this game. The man can't be doing everything for this team. Also some advice for Lebron would be to dribble lower. How many times I see him backing into someone and dribbling the ball practically up to his neck, then someone just swooping in and stealing it from him is just ridiculous. He's a great player but his TO's are racking up more and more and he needs to get that in check. He doesn't have a teammate like Ray Allen and DWade anymore to carry him through the clutch. I could probably go on like a 15page rant about pros and cons of the Cav's but I'm to tired right now... How do other people feel about Cav's trying to get Biyombo? Good or Bad Idea?||2
They need a rim protector. Their interior defense sucks. |76ers|2
Cavs might as well flip Love for Kelly O straight up if this is how they are going to use him.  |[BOS] Robert Parish|2
There was a stretch where Tristan Thompson and Richard Jefferson were both on the bench during that 5 min stretch where the warriors took the lead and Cavs didnt score. What the Fuck was up with that?? There was 4-5 min left in the game...|Warriors|2
The only big 3 that really worked instantly was Celtics 3 from 2007-8. Instant championship. That tells something about the culture, chemistry, maturity of players. You can spend as much as you want but hard to buy culture and chemistry. |Warriors Bandwagon|2

This seems so backwards.|Warriors|1
Fuck golden state|[CLE] Tristan Thompson|2
I don\'t know how anyone can watch that game and still say that the "series is rigged". The officiating was awful on both sides, and it still then favored the Cavs. LeBron gets away with fouls on multiple possesions and doesn\'t get punished or thrashed by the commentators/social media for pushing Draymond to the ground and then stepping over him. If Draymond does that, he\'s being ridicudled by ESPN, Reddit, Twtitter, etc. Just yet again shows that LeBron gets this insane cushion from the refs. |Lakers|6
Lebron should have been patient and stayed with Miami. He still would have made the finals, and would probably have beaten the warriors last year..Let's not pretend that Riley would have gotten them the players the need. Now he has handcuffed himself, and since he will never bring a trophy to Cleveland, his career will be seen as a loser that couldn't do it without another player that if not better, but at least his equal (D-Wade).\n\nHis finals performance have also been extremely poor. There is the series against Mavericks that will always be in the back of his mind and something that lebron haters love to bring up, and now this series, where it is painfully obvious his game has fallen off a cliff. Maybe it really is mental, or he just doesn't have the physical tool that made him a beast from 2010-2014. But clearly his time has passed. \n\nIMO, he needs to take a year off from the finals, maybe lose in the 2nd or 3rd round next season, and come back with a fresh mentality, and a fresher body. No way the cavs are winning with how great the Warriors are.  ||7
Averaging a triple double is falling off? Ok\n|Lakers|-7
He nearly averaged a triple double in 2011 as well. But he didn't do dick that series. Those stats were empty. ||1
Your a Cavs fan your emotional go home |West|1
Actually im a lakers fan. This is a bandwagon flair|Lakers|0
Stats don't tell the whole story. How many times did he settle for a jumper when he can get to the rim whenever he wants and more often than not get a foul call as well. He's the most athletic player the league has ever seen and he's settling for long twos and and threes that he shouldn't be taking. |Lakers|2
empty stats. he made 0 difference in the game tonight. Cleveland needs him to be Jordan, and not chris paul. ||9

Or are we still gonna call him overrated like after games 1-3?\n\nLeBron is great, Curry is great. Individual games don\'t change this. They both are and will always be amazing, once in a lifetime players. Everyone bashes the media for their "hot takes" but this sub is the biggest offender.|Suns|9

This is definitely not a "Choke". This series is fucking lame, and I\'m rooting for GSW. I was promised a titanic clash, all I got was the fucking titanic crash.   \nThe only reason I\'d call choke is the fact that they pitched that CLE only list because injuries last year, and they are getting fucking dealt with this series||2
But thats falsely assuming that this is the same GS team as last year. They are obviously much better this season.||1

Unpopular opinion (maybe): My thoughts on this would've been the same no matter the result but I loved the officiating tonight. As a fan, I've been praying for a taste of old school basketball and tonight we got exactly that. Undoubtedly there were missed calls but the refs letting both teams get physical and not automatically blowing a whistle anytime a guy drove hard into the paint was a breath of fresh air. The chippiness of the whole game provided an unbelievably tensed atmosphere that hasn't happened too many times recently. I loved it and hope it continues past these Finals.|Warriors|13
This wasn't old school basketball. This was occasionally letting the game get out of hand and occasionally calling weak fouls, with no consistency. |Warriors|48

Honestly it was much better than LeBron's ISO all he did was dribble the ball to the 3pt line and then Jack a 3. Or he would go into the lane then pass it out to his unreliable dissapointing teammates||1
LeBron's actions looked real bad once the Warriors took over in the 4th. He was bugging for real.|[OKC] Jeremy Lamb|3
There needs to be a way to retroactively remove garbage time stats. Historians need to know how bad of a game LeBron James just played. It was historically bad and nobody will remember that in 20 years. |Bulls|4
Draymond is getting in Lebron's head, I love it|NBA|3
My hot takes:\n\n1) Curry is unstoppable when he is on and he was on for a lot of the game tonight. He scores so many points so fast. Just crazy. I never get used to seeing it.\n\n2) James had a great game, but is clearly not the same player he was with the Heat. I keep waiting for him to completely take over, but he never does anymore.\n\n3) Clay is a beast. Iggy is amazing.\n\n4) Now I get why some people think Kyrie is so good. I never thought he was the second coming, but I don't watch many Cavs games. When he makes good decisions, he is a special player offensively. Problem is, he can't seem to put together a string of those types of games together?\n\n5) This game was super physical. I think that was an advantage for the Cavs. \n\nOverall, the best game since Warriors Thunder game 7 by far.\n\nI don't think the Cavs will be able to win Game 5 in Oakland, but they can score so many points, so I could see them stealing a game.\n\nHopefully, it will be a great game.|Heat|3
>James had a great game\n\n40% shooting (before the garbage time baskets), 7 turnovers, missed clutch shots and clutch free throws. empty stats. \n\nGarbage performance. |Mavericks|1

Cavs had their chances in this game. Had an 8-point lead in the third but let GSW back in it. Too many late turnovers and poor rebounding on the defensive end. Kyrie had a great game but I feel they needed more from someone else other than him and LeBron to get over the hump. |Braves|3
So...Kevin love? Seriously the guy is just disappointing.\n|Lakers|2
Golden State will take it in 6 games. I don't think Lebron will allow the Cavs to lose the next game, but they'll lose game 6. ||3
Nah, GS will wanna wrap this one up. I think they'd rather win at home. If Curry and Klay are hot, Cleveland doesn't have a chance in hell.||2

1. Thought the refs weren't very good this game. There's a point when you let them play too much. Lots of contact uncalled both ways.\n\n2. Cavs held up decently until the 4th. Reminded of me OKC Game 6 where Durant/Westbrook isos just killed them in the end. It was like they were playing the [four corners offense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_corners_offense) at times. Only way to keep up with this GSW team offensively is with ball movement. Most of the fourth quarter they were limited offensively to Lebron/Kyrie dribbling the clock down to 10 at the top of the key then going. So frustrating to watch.\n\n3. Why don't Lebron teams ever have him make off-ball cuts more often instead of him trying to take it off the dribble? He's an incredible cutter, how are you supposed to stop him if he gets the ball 6 feet from the hoop while already having momentum? He's easy to stay in front of off the dribble, the hard part is keeping up once he gets a slight edge on the defender from a misstep....\n\n4. Thought Kyrie played admirably tonight. Lue let him loose a little bit after the game 2 he had and I think that was the smart decision.\n\n5. WTF was with the open jumpers the Warriors were getting? I find it baffling that the Cavs lost their man on the perimeter and got lost in switches so many times when they're playing the best 3PT shooting team in NBA history.\n\nCavaliers will have to play out of their minds for the rest of the series to take this one away from Golden State. I don't think they make it out of next game... Warriors smell blood|Cavaliers Bandwagon|2
> Reminded of me OKC Game 6 where Durant/Westbrook isos just killed them in the end.\n\nIt\'s called "hero ball" or iso ball, but I like calling it "Thunderitis."|Trail Blazers|2

They lost because they were exhausted. Kyrie, JR and Lebron played 43, 43 and 46 minutes respectively. They don't have any kind of answer for the Death Lineup and can't handle playing small against them an entire game. I wish they tried to downsize and play Lebron at the 5 with JR, Kyrie, Delly, and Jefferson. I think that line up could challenge the Warriors athletically.\n\nBTW Does anyone have a video of Iggy guarding Love and Lebron at the same time? That was dope.|Pistons|2

Watching the Cleveland Offense is so boring. Mostly LeBron Iso for the whole possession dribble 10 times to the 3pt line and Jack up a 3. The other 4 players just stand in the 2 corners and Triston Thompson only showing signs of life by going to get the rebound and fight for the ball. \n\nThe other thing that really frustrates me is you have the "Worlds Best Basketball Player" with an unstoppable body(which can guard multiple positions and force matchups that are mostly in his favor) but yet all I saw was LeBron sort of go to the basket but then instead of taking shots himself, he awkwardly passes to his teammates who cant make something out of the pass but miss a 3 badly. Why not just use that big ass truck of a body that would run defenders over and attack the paint. Most teams would try to isolate LeBron out of the paint because that is where he does most of his scoring and damage. Although LeBron did try to attack the basket a couple of times, the Warriors had a plan of stopping him by getting a hand on the ball causing LeBron to lose hand of the ball which would become a loose ball.||2

I know the cavs haven't lost the series just yet, but can you imagine what must be going through lebrons head right now?\n\nHe's been to the finals 7 times and lost 4 of them and quite possibly the 5th with this series.\n\nEvery time he comes up short. And it's not for any lack of effort on his part. It's got to be so disappointing to lose time after time after pouring everything into trying to win it.||2
Dude lebron fuccn sucks he picks his teams and still can't win and people like you think its great because he pads his stats|Minneapolis Lakers|1
>fuccn||1
Are you kidding me? The one with the most heart out there was Kyrie. LeBron chucking up 3s and stat padding with 45 seconds left is bullshit |Warriors|3
LeBron's has led his teams to 7 NBA Finals...you can't say he doesn't have heart. If you really believe that, I cannot take you seriously.||1
Way to chop and screw my words. I'm talking about is one game where Kyrie had more heart and you want to extrapolate that to LeBron's entire career |Warriors|1
If you take into account the original comment, the user mentions LeBron leading his team to 7 Finals...only to fall short in most of them (due to weak supporting casts for the most part). Yet you decide to zero in on one game.||1
He dug his own grave when he left a stable and well-established organization in Miami. The possibility that he may never win a ring again is real. |Heat|4
So he's a villian for leaving for Miami and he's a villian for leaving Miami and heading back to Cleveland. He can't win anything it seems like.||1

i know it wont happen, but for the sake of basketball, please let the Cavaliers make this interesting, at least. and for the sake of the greatness, please let LeBron James know that he doesnt have to rot on the Cleveland Cavaliers for the rest of his career, knowing he cant win there. go back to Miami.||2
Honestly it would be a shame if he stayed due to a sense of obligation. He has put in more than his due of effort.|Cavaliers|1
I'd say it got pretty interesting.|NBA|2
Lol yeah it was ok||1
As a Cavs fan, I agree. I wouldn't blame him for leaving. It's about winning. Miami is too easy but go somewhere where the pieces are close to complete. I understand the legacy thing but he's not winning one here. Please save us from seeing the Warriors win the next 3.  |Cavaliers|2

I've never been more happy to be wrong. No need to name call. |Cavaliers|1

It's all Kevin's fault. |Rockets|1
Irving lost them the game in the 4th on offense and especially defense. The Warriors got so many open shots off of Irving's switching indecisions!\n\n Poor officiating as well allowing too much unnecessary contact on both ends of the floor. Players were basically just shoving each other back and forth. \n\nIn the end though, loss is on the Cavs. They did have an 8pt lead during the 3rd before they imploded.\n\nSidenote: Love is not a great fit for this team.|Thunder|1
I was waiting for the Cavs fans to chant "Lets Go Cavs" for the remaining of the game. |Raptors|1
So...who wins FMVP? Dray? Iggy? Steph?|Raptors|1

Cavs absolutely fell apart offensively down the stretch.  No movement, no trust, and just predictable play after play.  Shouldn't surprise anyone that they lost how they did.  The Warriors trust one another, and their system, to the bitter end, and they're the better team for it.\n\nOn another note, I'm very disappointed in LeBron.  I've come to admire his demeanor and professionalism on court, so to see him devolve into petty showboating, arguments, and frustration fouls is hard to watch.

Tonight was a night Lebron needed to get himself going, alongside Kyrie, rather than continuing to defer to others. The 3rd quarter especially, he drove to the paint with intent to pass out every single time. Had he attacked with intent to score and take the game over, the rest of the floor opens up and the game may go differently.\n\nFrustratingly unselfish, sometimes. |[OKC] Russell Westbrook|1
Needed to go straight up Mamba. |Clippers|2
Definitely agree. I really think the Cavs win if he does. Would have opened up Kyrie even more as well. |[OKC] Russell Westbrook|1

I can safely say that every time I have watched Richard Jefferson play he has been losing in the Finals. This goes back to the Nets - Lakers series. ||1
The real important thing about this game is we all get free tacos. Thanks Steph!|76ers|1
The Cavs are far too slow initiating their offense. Time and time again they waste 18+ seconds on the shot clock with zero movement off the ball and either James standing still faking passes or Kyrie dancing around on the spot.  They looked good when they move the ball, but so frustrating to watch when they revery to late shot clock isos or forced passes.  |Spurs|1
some of that definitely goes on Lue at the end... As JVG said there was no offensive movement whatsoever in the 4th.. they need a real coach who can make in game adjustments. |Lakers|1

Watching Kevin Love post-up is painful. How does a guy that size not have a polished post-up game? I get he is used to shooting from outside, but when you're that tall, you need to have some post-up moves or else you're going to be useless down-low with an above average defender on you.|Lakers|1
He has NOOOO upper body muscle. I'm more cut than he is. It'd be fine if he was Paul Pierce and was a SG/SF but yea\nlooks like he's never lifted a day in his life|Celtics|2
I get why he does it (as well as other NBA players): they don't want to lose agility/flexibility with bulking. But come on dude...beef up just a tad.|Lakers|1

The Cavs tonight looked like the 2011 Heat team, a lot of isolation and no ball movement! But at the same time big if true!||1

yeah, whatever grace period i was affording lue is done. he needs to go. |Cavaliers|1
There was a stretch where GSW's ball movement was really bad and they resorted to ISO ball, problem is Cleveland decided to match it with their own isolation stagnation. Ughhh....what a wasted opportunity.|[DAL] Dirk Nowitzki|1

i wish to see the cavs win 3 straight. but i really just dont see it. they just dont seem to have shown much heart. last years cavs showed more passion in one quarter than this years team the entire series. was pretty exited that they were healthy but it seems their hustle was left out along with it.|Spurs|1
That 4th quarter by Cleveland was an abomination. They just completely abandoned everything they did during the first 3 quarters and relied on hero ball which will never beat Golden State.  |Celtics|1
As OKC found out in the series before|West|1
And each regular season game this year |Celtics|2
The difference in the first half and second can be summed up with one thing, offensive rebounds. Thompson was a beast on the glass and gave them so many opportunities and I think it may have even made the Warriors a bit dejected. Once those stopped, the Warriors slowly found their groove. MVP for the Cavs is honestly TT, his impact on the offensive glass is irreplaceable for the Cavs.|Wizards|1
Why did he not get as much playing time in the second half and especially the 4th quarter? He was killing us.|Warriors|1
I knew when LeBron got into the lane and passed the ball that the Warriors were going to win. He seemed to go out of his way to get his teammates involved and the frustrating part is that the game was right there for the Cavs to win. LeBron really did let me down this game and I hate to say that. I get that he is not as athletic as he once was but I prefer an aggressive LeBron that misses shots at the rim than a passive LeBron. I mean the game was right there to be stolen...smh. Ugh.|[CLE] LeBron James|1
Damn I feel bad for cavs. Near the end when they were down ~7 with 2 minutes, Kyrie made a lay up but the crowd didn't even have the energy to cheer. They also couldn't muster up the energy to boo steph or klay on their free throws. Sorta reminds me of when okc look like they didn't put in any effort whatsoever despite being down ~8 with a minute to go.||1
I'll be damned if that didn't look like a street ball game on both ends.|[BOS] Paul Pierce|1
Damnit, Love.||1
So pumped hahaha|Hawks|1
Right after the footage on my station cut from Lebron going into the locker room, it cuts to breaking news for a double murder :D|Knicks|1
Unreal. LeBron can't catch a break and I'd really hate to see him lose again. Don't know why he doesn't just take over games like he did in Miami.|[NYK] Nate Robinson|1
First close game. That was so good!!!||1
LeBron one assist from having a triple double... again.|Warriors|1
Cavs fans get fucked again.|Raptors|1
Basketball evolved where you shoot the 3 better than the 2. |Thunder|1
Lebron and Kyrie seemed adamant about attacking the lane in the final minutes of the fourth and the Warriors were just not having it. Maybe try and kick it out and get some ball movement to get better looks? Just seemed like they were trying to draw fouls and with the refs not really blowing the whistle much it just seemed questionable. |Mavericks|1

I gave a feeling Kevin Love is going to mysteriously disappear for the next game.|Heat|1
Fuck. |Raptors|1
The Cavs were worn down and tired the last 5 minutes of the game. No legs left for Lebron, Kyrie.||1
That game was... bizarre|Knicks|1
Not calling anything just caters to less talented players. It's tiresome watching shit not get called||1
It also caters to the team that wants to play more physical, which is also cleveland. |Warriors|1

I am legitimately sad after that loss. I guess I just hate the Warriors so damn much. Just like I hated the heat.|[BOS] Paul Pierce|1
The Warriors have a great ability to stay in games when they are playing badly. \nOther teams would fall down by 15, 20 points. But somehow Golden State just manage to scrape by and keep hanging around.\nThen Curry and Klay eventually heat up and the game is over. It's pretty amazing. |Pacers|1
How about that free taco though?||1

Kevin Love doesn't need to be in the game when LeBron and Irving are on the floor. He's the 3rd option and can't play defense and Varej\xc3\xa3o was taking him to school on defense. I'm calling it now - he's gone if the Cavs lose in 5.||1

At least one finals game becomes a 90s throwback, with lots of physicality. That's how it always goes and people whining about the refs must be new fans. This always happens.||1
Yeah this game was super rough and tumble. I don't want games called like that, but I was more or less okay with it all since they were pretty consistent about letting basically everything go, so it wasn't like they were just calling certain things really harsh or certain players. There were some hard fouls that the Cavs didn't get called for, but there were some fouls the dubs weren't called for either. It evened out|Warriors|1

Btw. Who is dis McAdoo guy? \xf0\x9f\x98\x8e||1
He's an athletic, high energy big we've used off the bench occasionally when Bogut/Festus were injured. First meaningful minutes he's gotten ever in the postseason. My guess was Kerr did it as a matchup problem and he played well. Varejio also has played great against the cavs but was so awful during the regular season. I assume it takes time to adjust to our system and it must make him feel great playing well against his old team|Warriors|4
Yeah. Props to Kerr to have the balls go into his bench like that. The guy is playing chess while everyone else is playing checkers. ||2
I'll take Kerr's experience and wisdom over Lue all day. No disrespect to Lue but Kerr has been there and done that, on and off the court countless times.  |Warriors|1

If Lebron can rally his team and they play the good defense they've shown they can then we've seen how they shut down Curry and Thompson. The problem will be keeping that defense going. That's why I'm still saying game 6. We'll see though. ||1
Well you nailed it.|NBA|2

UNANIMOUS MVP|[GSW] Corey Maggette|-1
If Lebron loses another finals in 5, this will the 3rd time he has lost a finals in 5 or fewer games. Is that acceptable for an all time great player? |Pelicans|0
Apply proper context|NBA|1
It's also the seventh time he's been to the finals including dragging a really bad Cleveland team there all by himself.|Pacers|2
This cleveland team has **the highest salary in the nba** /u/gt1master_ike don't forget lebron has picked his teammates out literally and still lost like this. People overrate him because of his statistics and confuse that with the impact of an all timer which shows up in team excellence. |Minneapolis Lakers|1
LeBron without a doubt makes those around him better. Remember that terrible Cleveland team he took to the finals by himself before going to Miami?\n\nI don't dispute the idea that LeBron has hand picked his team and it hasn't been the best mix. Criticize him as a GM then, not a player. Comparisons to MJ23 become even more relevant.|Pacers|0
Lebron got to the finals because the east sucks. Lebron is 2 and 4 in the finals picking his teammates he sucks compared to mj. There is something wrong with you. Didn't you just see this game right now jesus christ.\n\n\n Lebron is hardly even top ten all time |Minneapolis Lakers|1
"Hardly even top ten all time" = choke artist who sucks?\n\nOut of curiosity who are the nine you put in front of him? You could probably sanely argue a top ten that doesn\'t include him, but the bottom several would be highly debatable.\n\n|Pacers|1
Kobe, Mj, Shaq, Russell, Wilt, Olajuwon, Kareem, Magic, Bird, Dr.J,  Duncan, Robertson etc.  |Minneapolis Lakers|1
Kobe never won a title without a team around him and paired with one of your others for multiple titles.\n\nMJ never got to a finals without a team around him (but admittedly still prolly GOAT) .\n\nRussel played in a much smaller league when titles required less to get through.\n\nWilt only won two titles, same as LeBron despite team jumping more than LeBron\n\nOlajuwon only won two titles and appeared in significantly fewer than LeBron.\n\nKareem won titles with one of the other guys on your list\n\nMagic won titles with one of the other guys on your list\n\nBird only has one more title than LeBron and fewer finals appearances\n\nDrJ only had three titles and two were in a watered down ABA\n\nDuncan has been on a stacked team his whole career\n\nI could keep going...\n\nThe common theme in your list is these players all had more help than LeBron and often they paired up with other top players on your list.|Pacers|0
So basically you just knock nba legends in order to make lebron seem epic|Minneapolis Lakers|2
I didn\'t knock them, I compared them to LeBron,and LeBron compares favorably. If, for example, I say, "Well Kobe and LeBron have both been to seven finals, Kobe won five and LeBron lost five, but to be fair three of Kobe\'s came when he had another arguably (on your list) top ten all time player in Shaq on his team - how many does Kobe have if he desn\'t pair with Shaq?"\n\nNow maybe Kobe still has five rings, and maybe he only has two. And maybe he didn\'t even get to seven finals. We can\'t know for sure. But we know for a fact that Kobe had the help of another guy on your top ten list to win some of his titles, and LeBron hasn\'t.|Pacers|1
I should add I don't necessarily think you're wrong in your list but other than MJ23 (and maybe Magic/Bird) it's not unreasonable to debate LeBron is better.|Pacers|1

I think you can argue that KD or Westbrook is as good as Lebron now that his jumper has died a fiery death. ||0
This might sound biased, but I would have said this regardless of whichever team won. That was the best game of the series by far. Competitive physically and mentally.  The 3rd quarter and onwards especially when it was getting chippy, players smack talking and the refs were letting them play through it (despite some questionable calls on both teams towards the end of the quarter) just upped the intensity. I'm sure fans from both sides are frustrated with all the missed calls, but damn was it great to watch what many old school players would call damn good basketball. Finally felt like there was a sense of urgency and heart from both teams the first time this series. |Warriors|1

From down 3-1 in the NBA Finals*. The chances for CLE or slim to none...sigh.||3
Sure, they\'re slim. But the chances of the Warriors coming back were also slim. I think after watching that series, just about everyone concedes that OKC should have won it...and yet they didn\'t.\n\nI\'m just already sick of hearing the "no one has ever come back from this deficit before" crap. It literally just happened.|Supersonics|1
hoist it|76ers|1
So you are comparing the warriors (up 3-1) the defending champs to the thunder (up 3-1) who have never won anything and are known for choking? |Heat|4
Yes, there's a comparison. That's because both teams are up 3-1. Are there differences, too? Sure. But now that I'm hearing over and over again that no finals team has ever come back from down 3-1, it's hard not to notice that a team came back from 3-1 down just the other day. Do I think the Cavs come back? No. But it's far from impossible.|Supersonics|1
Tell me Dray can't guard 1-5|[GSW] Klay Thompson|1
Kylie was such a ball hog down the stretch \n\nEdit: I was gonna change this but fuck Kyrie he deserves a girl name |Magic|1
For all the shit LeBron's gonna get, his matchup is a little like the Warriors/Curry when they play OKC. Curry had trouble shooting when so many guys on OKC have the length to contest his shots. LeBron's having trouble because so many guys on the Warriors can bother him. Iguadala and Green especially mess with his averages, but then guys like Klay and Livingston as well are well above-average at guarding him. Both elite players (Curry and Lebron), but with so many defenders who can switch and double you from the respective teams, you can't 100% blame them for putting up poor numbers. |Warriors|1
Can someone explain how that Bogut alley-oop wasn't a shooting foul? I don't understand how that was a possible outcome in that situation. Like, the NBA refereeing processes should not have allowed that to happen. It was called a foul, on a very clear alley-oop interrupted by the called foul, but then wasn't calling a shooting foul.\n\nThat's not like a judgment call where they miss the foul or are overzealous.  They made the correct determinations, and then assessed the incorrect penalty.  That's a major process screw up.|Pistons|1
Refs were beyond trash this game. Lots of questionable calls both ways |Warriors|1
I think if you dont have control of the ball it is considered a loose ball foul. |Lakers|2
If Lebron really wants to win that badly he should just take a small ass contract and bring in better guys. |Cavaliers|1

Watch his highlights on the r/NBA stickied highlights. Most 3s in a season, and then broke his own record this year. Beautiful passing, quickness, cold shots from the arc. Yhe guy is small and skinny, yet he dominates with incredible skill and toughness. He can drive with fancy layups and fingerrolls, and can shoot from way beyond the arc. To top it off, he is incredibly classy and plays unselfish basketball all throughout the season. He trusts in his teammates and stays confident- just look at his poise when they were down 3-1 against OKC.\n\nMost of all he's the first unanimous MVP this year, and is about to carry his team to their secons championship in back to back years.|Lakers|2

Everyone talking about Cleveland going ISO and throwing the game away. GS plays hella D in the 4th when the game is close. They force you to go ISO. That's how we lost 3 games in a row. Of course Kyrie and Lebron have the same tendencies as WB and KD to go ISO glory mode but GS did have a hand. They did it to Portland too when Lillard and CJ went ISO mode. \n\nIt also helps how disciplined GS is that they keep the ball moving even in moments where you are tempted to go ISO which Klay did a bit chucking up crazy 3s but they still kept it moving. No way Cleveland wins next game but hey maybe they do but man the Warriors are some tough mofos. \n\nI just gotta add, Iggy is so fuckin good though. He had a big hand in us losing and the Cavs losing tonight. Anything from clutch God D in the 4th, clutch rebounds, putbacks and clutch 3s. Dude is the little things that matter so much in the long run.|[OKC] Russell Westbrook|1
yeah there defense was disciplined as fuck. but i think mid 3rd quarter when the cavs stopped getting calls they got discouraged and stopped moving the ball too|Cavaliers|-1
That's what happens. In our series we stop moving the ball when shots don't go in or when we just couldn't find someone to pass it to. KD and WB would just say fuck it we'll ave go at it. GS are just so disciplined that they keep moving the ball even if it's not working because eventually it will. Annnd they also have the advantage of just throwing it to Curry or Klay and have them hit some clutch 3s.|[OKC] Russell Westbrook|1
So frustrating|Cavaliers|1

Would have loved to have seen LeBron stay in Miami. Respect going back, but he would've had a better shot staying of more titles. Now he's screwed no matter what he does. Jump ship again and he's a traitor. Stay and it'll be tough to get the tools needed in Cleveland. Ah well. Hopefully in the future fans don't only count rings as the sole measure. |NBA|1

I liked how GS used the size of Bogut and Varejao to get some good looks for Curry. He'd been getting so beat up off ball with the small line ups, made sense to put some big bodies in there for his man to have to navigate |Bulls|1

They definitely won because of the refs.\n\nNot the 11 missed free throws or anything. ||-2
Relax brother, I never said the Cavs were going to win regardless. I mentioned the refs because they played a big part. Read the post again.|Wizards|0
In the 4th the (non)calls benefited GSW, but I feel like they were adapting their play to the way things had been called in the 3rd.  The Cavs benefited from the refs big time in the 3rd.||-1
Idk about that... the refs were awful for both teams. Honestly one of the most balanced horribly reffed games I've ever watched.|Lakers|1
I felt like they let a lot go both ways. Love the intensity from both sides though.|Knicks|1
Nothing to do with officiating. Cavs missed 11 FTs. Thats where you can point your finger.|Supersonics|2
The refs were straight ass. Players were getting hit in the face all night, calls were inconsistent, and they had no control over the players. Really something the NBA should look at|Warriors|2

I'm big fan of these teams, but oh boy such a boring NBA finals this season :/ I miss the good old NBA days :)||0
Boring finals? Depends on what you think is boring- even though the games have been lopsided, the Warriors played STUNNINGLY beautiful basketball in G1 and G2- a new type of basketball that is changing the entire league (a la changes with LAL, ATL, POR, SAS). G3 was boring imo, but G4 was an intensely fought game with incredible efforts by both teams, especially in the 1st half. Then the GSW's dominance in the 3Q and 4Q was mesmerizing. \n\nWitnessing a team win the most games in a season (88) and shoot the most 3s in a finals ever (17 3pts and 16 2pts to win a game?!) is highly unprecedneted, so I don't see that as boring whatsoever. |Lakers|3

Most disappointing sports game I've ever watched. The Cavs took the lead early in the fourth and then for the rest of the game every player on the team stood completely still on offense. I've never seen anything like it. They gave golden state a free win after back n forth haymakers for 7 quarters. \n\n\nMan what the fuck actually happened to make them do that ||0
Tired?||1
My only logical explanation is that they had just given their entire heart out to play with the Warriors but they just couldn't do it anymore. The Warriors are the better, deeper team. Not resting Kyrie, Lebron, or Smith killed themZ they were all dead legged||1
Why does K Love get hated on soo much? I will say I haven't watched most of the finals. ||0

Every single pundit I have herd has been saying if Cleveland goes down 3-1 the series is unquestionably over. \n\n\nWould love to see them eat their words....but they probably wont. ||-3

Probably because the stat is something like 0-31 when a team is down 3-1. They're not being dicks just going off history and the fact Cleveland isn't good enough to win 3 straight. |Lakers|4
You said you hope they eat their own words like they did something wrong saying it's over if they go down 3-1. Just pointing out why they said it. |Lakers|1

Cavs can't continue to fall into iso-ball late in the game. It stagnates their offense and allows the Warriors to gain momentum. That was the key to today's loss. Warriors also capitalized on the cavs mistakes in the 4th quarter. |Nuggets|0

Lots of, "Well where\'s the excuse for LeBron\'s likely 5th finals loss," type comments. He has been to seven finals, including one with a Cavs team that not only isn\'t a playoff team without him but is a bottom dweller. And seven finals appearances is more than Jordan, Pippen, Parish, Duncan, Chaimberlain, Bird; more than Miller+Ewing+Malone combined; I could keep going.\n\nThe fact of the matter is the Warriors are a great team. LeBron is the best layer of his generation hands down. He ran into an all time team, a 73 win team. What do you want him to do? There were more years during MJ23s career where he didn\'t have the best tea than he did, and he never won anything until he had the best team around him.\n\nBut whatever, LeBron sucks.|Pacers|-9
Where was lebron tonight? How about that instead of considering all of time lol|Minneapolis Lakers|3
25-13-9 with 52% from the field with good D is terrible /s\n\nSarcasm aside I would have liked to see him be more aggressive myself but it's hard to take over against a 73 win team, otherwise they wouldn't have 73 wins.|Pacers|-1
Last series the thunder took the warriors to seven games |Minneapolis Lakers|4
Most pundits judged the Thunder as a more complete team than the cavs coming into the playoffs. What's your point?|Pacers|0
I don't think any of those guys ever played in a conference as weak as the east of the last 6 years. |Timberwolves|5
But LeBrn has been to the finals for six straight years. That proves that in a bad conference his presence alone is enough to swing a team to the finals. That's an argument for how dominant he is. |Pacers|1
It also proves how garbage the East is. The East is garbage and LeBron is a dominant force. Both can be true.|Warriors|2
7 finals appearances is amazing. I don't blame him for the losses.\n\nBut to be fair, his jumper does suck. For GOAT consideration you have to take that into account. It's affecting his ability to take over games because they just sag off him.|Celtics|6
Using his personal finals performances as a measure for pure Alpha-GOAT is absolutely fair. But he still belongs "in the conversation" as being among the best. You would expect him to perform worse against a great team. How much worse is debatable as to how far down on the GOAT totem pole you knock him, but he\'s still on the pole.|Pacers|3
I don't think anyone but the crazy overreactors are saying that Bron isn't in the conversation of those all time great players.|Warriors|1
Agreed, but there's a lot of crazy over-reactors in this thread.|Pacers|1
This era of Warriors circle jerk is going to be too much on ESPN and social media. |Cavaliers|-4

Way too many times where Kyrie was the only one to touch the ball in the 4th quarter for the Cavs. |Heat|-1
Kyrie lost this game for the Cavs. There was a span where Irving took like 90% of the shots, missed most of them. Took the momentum out of the Cavs and allowed the Warriors to build momentum themselves. \n\nAnd this happened around the 6th min. of the 4th, a critical time to screw up.|Spurs|-1

As a Cleveland, the Cavs lost their rhythm in the second half. But I can\'t blame them. Drive after drive. Foul after foul they stopped attacking the bucket because they couldn\'t score due to being fouled. Cavs reverted to jumpers and got out of rhythm.\n\nI know this is going to come off as "whiny Cavs fan", and yes there were some bad Warrior calls, but that 3rd quarter officiating knocked he Cavs out of it-embodied by the Iguodala knock of his knee out of bounds that was awarded to the Warriors and a 1:09 possession and a bucket.|Cavaliers|-1

Everyone keeps complaining about everyone complaining about the refs.\n\nBut here's the thing- how many of you can honestly say whether or not this game would have turned out the same had they been competent? Not particularly good, mind you, just competent. If you are raising your hand, put it down. You're a liar. This was an absolute shit show. If you're not going to call fouls, OK. Fine. But do it for both teams, and do it consistently, at the very least.\n\nMy God, the number of times a Cavs player drove and was mauled by *multiple* Warriors with no whistle was absolutely insane. And then possesion would switch and a phantom and 1 is called in transition or an illegal screen is allowed leading to 3 points. And then The Cavs drive up the floor and get a ticky tack foul call in their favor, completely contradicting the first non-call on their last possession. It's one thing to be bad, it's *absolutely unacceptable* to be inconsistent like this. You literally take the game out of the players' hands because they don't know what they're allowed to do.\n\nAs a fan, this was painful to watch. Worse than painful. It reminded me why basketball is my least favorite of the big American sports to watch. And these are supposed to be the best refs *in the world* out there calling this game. The league should be downright embarrassed.||-1
bad calls both ways. nuff said \n||1
You completely missed the point. That's *not* enough said. Even if the fouls were even on each team, it doesn't matter. All fouls or blown calls are not the same. Some lead to 3 point plays, some lead to a non-3. Some lead to a good opportunity, some to bad opportunities, some to transitions, etc.\n\nThe problem is that when there are *so many* blown/missed/bad foul calls, you have no clue what *should* have happened.||0
lmao.  what do you mean "...what SHOULD have happened?" lmao.  nothing "SHOULD\'VE" happened. If cavs didn\'t want to be down 3-1, they shoulda won games 1 or 2. nuff said  ||2
lmao.  what do you mean "...what SHOULD have happened?" lmao.  nothing "SHOULD\'VE" happened. If cavs didn\'t want to be down 3-1, they shoulda won games 1 or 2. nuff said  ||2
It's not that hard to understand. It's a competition. What should happen in an athletic competition is- the better performing team wins. Who the hell knows who performed better when the refs dictate that performance to such a high degree by stopping play when the shouldn't and not stopping play when they should.\n\nEDIT: Also do you sign all your posts with 'nuff said'. That's about as obnoxious as I'd expect a dubs fan to be. Touche.||1
lmao.  ur complaing about refs. Refs are always terrible. We\'re lucky if refs are consistent.  Refs were consistently horrible today.  Cavs had their chances to get back in the game but blew it at no fault of the refs.  "...as I\'d expect a dubs fan to be."  lmao! ||1

Well, Jim, my feeling is that technically speaking the warriors are requires to win four games. So I guess what I'm saying is that they have to win another game in order to clinch. \n\nSo we can't really give them the credit for clinching here until they grab another one from the cavs out of the next three games. \n\nYou know, who ever gets to four wins first is gonna come out on top here. It could be either team, technically speaking. \n\nI'm gonna go out on a limb and say that the team that plays better ball is gonna pull this one out. But at the end of the day it all comes down to points. If you score the ball more you're gonna win. Put more points up, you're going to come out on top. \n\nSo yea. Best team's gonna take it in seven or fewer games, Jim. |USA|-1

What in the fuck do you people see? One of the higher comments is about LeBron 'acting like a bitch.' Do you not watch Igoudala or any of their fucking players the entire game? This is coming from a cavs fan but I watch the game both ways. People hate on LeBron so much when in reality he's probably the last person anyone should be calling a bitch on the court. His getting fouled to foul call ratio is about a tenth of that of Curry's.\n\nEdit: bring on the warrior cocksuckers. ||-16
Curry rarely gets foul calls. That is all||3
Lebron is the most genetically gifted,  athletic, and strongest guy on the court. \n\nHe's been flopping and crying like a bitch his whole career. He should be called on it.||5
However sculpted he is SHOULDNT MATTER when it comes to whether it\'s a foul or not. And I\'ve seen at least 20 dudes in the NBA who bitch way more than LeBron. My defense for him is that, like you just said, he doesn\'t get calls because refs see things the same way you do in that "oh he\'s so masculine it shouldn\'t matter" when in reality he\'s just as human as anyone when it comes to other players altering his shots when he gets fouled||0
Everyone gets missed fouls. Show me proof that Lebron gets less calls then the rest of the league. Everyone gets mugged on their way to the rim.\n\nLebron cries a lot. Everyone knows it. His pouty facial expression has been meme'd a thousand different times. \n\nYou want to be King act like one.  ||2
